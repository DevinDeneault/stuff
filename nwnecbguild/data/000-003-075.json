      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">So, having played on Arelith for awhile and gaining some experience in game. I began to wonder why people do not ever consider longbow weapon master. Other than how it lacks AB compared to the arcane archer it seems to have a couple advantages. Higher crit range on longbow, possibility of 4x crits. Possibility to combo it with a melee weapon master for tons of hit points and melee capabilities with the ability to just swap to a rapier shield. With fighter levels it might even be possible to be a Fighter / Blackguard / Weaponmaster.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Is it possible to do this? Weapon Master Archer? Or am I overlooking something involved here? Or is the way I went about it all wrong and I am using the wrong classes to achieve my goals? I am not sure, I would really value the insight of the pros on this one.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Maybe something with RDD levels to boost up str, but it is just too simple (or not). I like the idea to boost str for melee, while you get the ranged AB from AA levels, and not DEX. Well, I made some RDD/AA builds in CBC with astronomical ranged AB and dev crit, but they don't have enough feats to manage a melee weapon... at best they can get a weapon finesse, but that's all.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
