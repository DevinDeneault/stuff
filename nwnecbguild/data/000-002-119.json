What about classes with memorized spells like Clerics / Druids?<br/>\n<br/>\nI note this was not mentioned in the NWN Wiki: Spell School or Talk section.<br/>\n<br/>\nThought I would share and see if anyone else has other experiences with this?

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks Yunim for looking into this.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever read the text on the Wiki page carefully Yunim. I referenced the wiki page in my original post plus the Talk section:<br/>\n<blockquote><div>A wizard may choose to specialize in a school of magic, thereby gaining one additional spell slot per spell level <strong>while losing the ability to cast spells from an opposed school</strong>. <strong>This prohibition extends to spells cast from scrolls, but not to spells cast from other kinds of items.</strong> In addition, specialist wizards have a bonus (+2) to identifying spells (through spellcraft) from their area of expertise and a penalty (-5) to identifying spells from the opposing school. Alternatively, a wizard may choose to not specialize, thus keeping access to all spells.</div></blockquote>\nNowhere in the current Wiki post is there a reference to whether taking a specialty school allows casting from usually prohibited spells from a different class such as Sorcerer as a memorized spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this could be a new piece of information, or the Wiki is missing this piece of information or is unclear.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIt affects builds which take a specialty wizard class along with another caster class.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI am curious if players have noticed this mechanic before?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
