I mean, what is, in your opinion, the strongest build capable of survival and dealing with nearly everything that comes its way without any need for magic items, scrolls and any gear other than mundane one? To make it even more challenging, let's say that the build also shouldn't rely on self-buffing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, sure, at some point the environment can get so harsh that it becomes impossible to survive in it without a proper gear and magic tools. But we are talking about the build that can do relatively well, with all the abovementioned limitations, there where others are bound to fail by default.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You get to know there are bad dudes around - well, no shit, Sherlock! (Pardon my language, please). And it's even worse in re-spawning areas. In BG1, in the Firewine Ruins, I guarantee you'll detect over 50 kobold commandos. Then another 50. And so on ad infinitum. And it doesn't tell you where they actually are - just \"around\". Very bloody helpful. Possibly the most pointless ability ever.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
