Even Monk/Paladin/XXX<br/>\n<br/>\n Melee preference - two-hands a katana or scimitar\u00a0for his STR\u00a0bonus\u00a0(katana should've been a two-hander all along)<br/>\n<br/>\n Range preference - DEX archery<br/>\n<br/>\n Weapon preference - katana or scimitar - orginally thought katana, but that burns an extra feat and one can legitimately make a case for scimitar as a \"saber\"<br/>\n<br/>\n 8) Maximum item enhancement - +5 environment<br/>\n<br/>\n 9) Spellcasting - I'd assume primarily a buffer<br/>\n<br/>\n 10) Custom factors - none,\u00a0 but would like BAB of 40+<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Moreover you will not want to lose +6 dmg/hit especially when it is multiplied by Wm criticals. You already lose some power due to race (lower strength) you see. But anyway if you don't want XP penalties then Monk 25/ CoT 8/ Wm 7 is what i recommend, with Monk 12/ CoT 4/ Wm 4 pre-epic, that will give you the exact amount of feats required to make the build and will postpone your Wm powers to 23rd level but that's what i would do. Going Wm wiithout either Fighter OR CoT is a pain, especially if you consider you aren't a Human for the bonus feat.<br/>\n<br/>\n That being said, if you haven't played yet a Monk/Wm then absolutely do it, it's a blast to rush through your opponents with the speed of the Monk, it really briings the smile on your face!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

No ED in the CoT version of course, but would perform a lot more like the actual Yoda with light saber in hand with slightly better saves. \u00a0Haven't plotted it out though, so the split is just thrown out helter-skelter but I agree completely about the DEX route. \u00a0Yoda was hardly a strongman but incredibly nimble. \u00a0You could probably even attach a minor self-compiled hakpak or override to the module, changing the appearance of a kama to a katana (that's what I would do) and get the best of both worlds and save a feat in the process. \u00a0He might even wield the modded weapon one-handed that way. \u00a0Not sure. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Clarity would be all you need for mind-control immunity. \u00a030 rounds should be plenty without even wasting a feat in Extended spells.

He was known for his legendary wisdom, mastery of the Force and skills in lightsaber combat. Yoda served as a member of the Jedi High Council in the last centuries of the Galactic Republic and as Grand Master oversaw the Jedi Order before, during and after the devastating Clone Wars. Following the First Battle of Geonosis, Yoda held the title of Master of the Order in addition to that of Grand Master. In his centuries of service to the galaxy and the Force, Grand Master Yoda had a hand in the training of nearly all the Jedi in the Order, including such luminaries as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ki-Adi-Mundi and Oppo Rancisis; all of whom would come to serve on the Jedi Council along with him. Standing at about 66 cm tall, Yoda was a male member of a mysterious species, details of which he did not reveal. Yoda served as a member of the Jedi Order for centuries, eventually gaining a seat on the Jedi High Council, before reigning as the Grand Master of the Jedi. He had exceptional skills in lightsaber combat, most commonly employing whirling and acrobatic Form IV techniques. Yoda was a But master of all but the Vaapad subset of Form VII (he had mastered the original Form VII variant known as Juyo) of lightsaber combat, and was considered by many as a swordmaster. \"<br/>\n<br/>\n So high wisdom, mastery of the Force and a skilled lightsaber combatant - Cleric/Something/Warrior?\u00a0 Or\u00a0will Divine Power make him Warrior enough?\u00a0 I can see Maximillan Kane's Shadow Priest single wielding a kama . . . but AB unbuffed is kinda low and all damage comes from buffs.\u00a0 If we had Intuitive Attack to work with . . .<br/>\n<br/>\n A high Wis cleric spamming Hammer of the Gods and wading in with lightkama to finish them off . . .
