      "content": "<div>Hello guildmembers!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a question and I feel very humble in doing so, as this is my first real post here.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone confirm if the PDK exploit regarding the third level feat of \"fear\" with a negative STR modifier still works under community patch 1.71?<br/>\nWhen I played my DEX-Based Bard multiclassing with PDK a few years ago (gosh) it worked fine. I'm pretty sure it was even viewable during combat and the DC for the class-feat fear of the PDK has to be 127. Unfortunately I updated the game half a year ago to 1.71 but played another Character. Last week I wanted to go on with my Bard / PDK but found that it didn't work anymore.\u00a0<br/>\nAfter a search through the patchnotes of 1.71 and even 1.70 I wasn't able to find any information about this.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n--&gt; So: Is my game somehow bugged or was the PDK feat \"fear\" somehow fixed?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this is a power-building guild where a PDK is somewhat out of focus, but I hoped someone could give me some insight.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks guys!</div>"

I've looked through everything I can find elsewhere about PDKs, but can't find any mention of a change to Fear's DC in 1.70/71, though I couldn't say whether EE has made a difference. Alas, this seems to imply you might indeed have a bug (either that or I haven't looked hard enough).<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe someone else has better insight.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

As I mentioned, I couldn't find any mention of a change either, so the problem most likely is on my end.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThumbs up!</div>"

(fixed in 1.71 actually just forgot to remove from list - 1.72 added scaling into PDK fear which was omitted)</div></blockquote>\n\nSo it does look like PDK fear did get addressed, and perhaps the negative Str thing was also addressed.</div>"

So I used 1.69 critical rebuild and the fear \"exploit with negative STR modifier worked again. After that I tried community patch 1.70 and the \"exploit\" didn't work. To sum up --&gt; in all versions of the community patch (1.70, 1.71 and 1.72) the \"exploit\" of the PDKs class-feat \"fear\" is fixed and workes as is should.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a nice evening guild members!\u00a0</div>"
