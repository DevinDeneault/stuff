      "content": "<div>Dwarves are a pretty cool race that, in my opinion, don't get utilized enough. I enjoy breaking stereotypes, so I decided to give a Dwarven Ranger a go. He ended up being pretty tanky with nice offensive power thanks to HiPS and Weapon Spec/Epic Weapon Spec. He\u00a0has seven Favored Enemies, 4 attacks per round, and Bane of Enemies, so whenever he's up against a FE, he has a lot of damage output. The Fighter levels gave me enough freedom with feats that I could take Lightning Reflexes and Iron Will to boost his lagging Reflex and Will saves, and still get the pre-requistes for Shadowdancer. He doesn't have a lot of skills, but what he does have is maxed out with the exception of Tumble, letting him function quite well as a scout and rogue-detecter. Power Attack and Cleave aren't here, but it shouldn't be too hard to swap them in if you want. Dual-wielding Handaxes is rather unusual, but it seemed fitting both to his dwarven heritage and woodsy nature.<br/>\n<br/>\n There's one other Dwarven Ranger build on this site: eatU4myT's <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2350745/Facebeating-Ranger-Ranger-26Fighter-4CoT-10#.VVVpJHlFDIU\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Face-beating</a>\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2350745/Facebeating-Ranger-Ranger-26Fighter-4CoT-10#.VVVpJHlFDIU\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ranger</a>. That build takes Champion of Torm levels for more health and higher saves (excluding Reflex),\u00a0boosts Con for Epic Damage Reduction, and has more attacks than this one. My build has Shadowdancer levels for Hide in Plain Sight and Tumble, higher Str, and a higher AC.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>\"Your kin couldn't\u00a0understand your odd fascination with\u00a0woods and\u00a0wilderness, but you'd always found the\u00a0solitude peaceful--a\u00a0quiet haven away from the noise-ridden bustle of city life.\u00a0At your parents' insistence you continued training in the militia, but your interest in becoming a dwarven defender was dwindling.You found yourself slipping away\u00a0more often than not, utilizing techniques you'd observed\u00a0in animals.

      "content": "<div>An interesting build you have here Apocrypha, i suspect you will want to dual-wield your handaxes and without the actual feats you need to stay in light armor only. When i normally see SD 5 somewhere, my first thought is that Epic Dodge is soon to follow, but such isn't the case here. You might want to move all your SD levels in epic (22nd. 27th. 32nd. 37th) in that way you not only hasten BoE but also gain +1 AB. Furthermore you only need 4 SD levels since defensive roll without ED is all but useless, so that allows you to take that 10th fighter level and another bonus epic feat with it (ewf OR ep) and in it's place you can take a Great Strength VI instead. Start with 16 Strength and with Great Strength VI you will end up with 32 Strength, that's another +1 AB. If you don't want to optimize your starting attributes, then you can\u00a0 go for Ranger 26/ Fighter / SD 2 and go for all seven Great Strengths, in that case take your SD levels at 22nd &amp; 37th levels respectively. And always maximize your tumble skill, put 40 ranks in it for +2 AC.<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hey Apocrypha!<br/>\n<br/>\n I like the idea, but like Valerfor, I don't understand why you did it the way you did. The first thing I will suggest is what Val has already said. Start with 16 Strength. The order of the feats is also weird because I don't think I've ever seen anyone start with Toughness in my 10 years of NWN. It appears that you chose your feats and then just randomly spread them between levels. At level 1 Toughness gives you +1 HP. There are better things to take at level 1, including WF, Dodge, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n I also agree that the spread is not optimized. You can alter the full spread to Ranger 26 Fighter 12 SD 2 and gain 2 extra feats and as Val suggested wait until after level 20 to take the first Shadowdancer level. I also suggest that you take a point from DEX and put it into INT, then you can have access to Expertise AND Improved Knockdown. You lose 1 AC, but Expertise alone gives you 5 when you need it. iron Will and Lightning Reflexes aren't doing much for you there, your saves are still low, so you can remove them for Expertise and IKD (but swap them around to get them earlier).<br/>\n<br/>\n I suggest that you read my Complete Guide to the Basics of Building in the Game Guides section. It explains some of the concepts which this build lacks, such as BAB building and Skill Dump optimization, and that'll help you understand the suggestions we're giving you.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div>"

      "content": "<div>I admit I'm rather a noob when it comes to building, so the advice is appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\n @Valerfor: The build doesn't have anywhere near high enough DEX for Epic Dodge--SD V was because I thought Uncanny Dodge II and Defensive Roll would be useful. I'm willing to drop it for Fighter 10 and another Great Strength, though. And yes, I will be dual-wielding handaxes, so staying in light armor was always the plan.<br/>\n<br/>\n @Maximillian Kane:\u00a0Your guide was quite helpful, thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n Initially I did have 16 STR, but I pulled a point from it to pump INT to 12 so I could max out the few skills I had. I'm not certain\u00a0what\u00a0other stat I could take from\u00a0to get it back to 16--I need 13 DEX for Dodge, 14 WIS for Ranger spellcasting, my CHA can't go any lower, and I'm always reluctant to pull from CON. Though I suspect that would be the stat to lower.<br/>\n<br/>\n Your idea of switching my DEX and INT stats to 13 and 13 for Expertise and IDK is a good one. I took a Shadowdancer level early because I thought people might appreciate getting HiPS pre-epic, but you're probably right that it's better to push it back.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hey Apo!<br/>\n<blockquote><div>I admit I'm rather a noob when it comes to building, so the advice is appreciated!</div></blockquote>\n\n There's nothing wrong with being a noob, it's how we all started. You have a positive attitude and I like it, you WANT to learn and we can help you with that. But your learning process won't be fast, no matter how clever you are, just simply because NWN is SO AMAZINGLY COMPLEX that nobody can learn all the ropes quickly. Maybe what you can do during this learning process is to post builds for critiquing in the Build Request Forum (I agree the title is a bit misleading, but that forum is for BOTH requests and unfinished builds) like Cosmic Tomato is doing. Since it's likely that you'll make a few mistakes in the learning curve, you could post your builds there first for analysis and when they've been duely tweaked and optimized you make a post here, so you can be proud of your work. I should have followed my own advice back when I joined in 2006, but I had noone to give me that advice. Back then my Magical Master was a Wizard 20 Cleric 20 which went for 20 WIZARD PRE-EPIC (cuz I had no idea how BAB progression worked) and wound up with 2 ATTACKS PER ROUND! Once I learned the ropes of building, I was embarrassed to see that \"thing\" with my name on it. Thankfully, the old forums are no more, and I was able to rectify my own shortcoming by posting the final version here.<br/>\n<br/>\n For this build, however, just post the tweaked version here and we'll go from there. After it's done, you can edit the title maybe.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div>"

I figured this was an acceptable trade, since the alternatives were losing points in\u00a0Spot and Discipline (no), and you have Camouflage and One With the Land to boost your stealth skills.<br/>\n - The build has one more AB and a grand total of two more hitpoints.<br/>\n - The Fort save is slightly higher, while Ref and Will are slightly lower.<br/>\n - Higher AC. Note that I have a bit of trouble calculating AC, so while I'm fairly certain it <em>is</em> higher,\u00a0the number may not be completely correct.<br/>\n<br/>\n Notes:<br/>\n<br/>\n I kept STR at 15, because by carefully shuffling the non-Grt STR feats into bonus feats, I was able to take seven GS as regular feats and get my STR to 32--higher than before!<br/>\n<br/>\n After some considering I decided to stick with SD IV, since the only worthwile feat I could have gotten from Fighter 12 was Epic Toughness, and I didn't think the build really needed that. Still, it's more\u00a0of a personal taste than anything--you can swap them if you like, though make sure to take your second SD level at 37 because otherwise, you can't max Tumble.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also! I remember why I did that stupid move of taking Toughness at level 1. For some reason I thought it added extra hitpoints for each level <em>after </em>you took it, not before. *slaps forehead*</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hey Apocrypha!<br/>\n<br/>\n Much better, but still not that good. it can be improved. Here we go! Expertise is better than Dodge, so take Expertise at level 3, Knockdown at 6, Blind Fight at 7, also anticipate Improved Knockdown and delay Improved Critical. Basically, delay Dodge as far as you can, and IKD takes precedence over Improved Critical. Toughness is better than Mobility, so swap those two as well. The rest of the pre-epic feats seems in place. <br/>\n<br/>\n Now, post-epic is where the trouble starts. You are planning to have Bane of Enemies, so I don't see a reason to take Epic Prowess instead of another FE at Ranger 20, which will give you something to do with that Fighter 12 Bonus Feat and a reason to go with the spread we suggested. Generally, with Rangers that have Bane, you want as many enemy types as you can fit in there. Take another FE at Ranger 20 and leave the Fighter 12 Bonus feat for Epic Prowess. That means you'll have one more group of monsters to which you will apply the AB and Damage bonuses from BoE.<br/>\n<br/>\n SD 1 needs to be taken at level 22. By that time it'll give you 5 AC and HiPS, which you'll DESPERATELY need at the time. Take the second Skill Dump at level 37 just as you would.<br/>\n<br/>\n I don't understand why you said that the second Tumble dump cost you Hide and Move Silently. Ranger HAS Hide and Move Silently as class skills! You can max them out no problem!<br/>\n<br/>\n Make these tweaks and then compare them. You'll see it'll look much better!<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div>"

      "content": "<div>@ Max, right! I forgot it is SD not ASS.<br/>\n<br/>\n Still though, the benefits are something to consider unless you play on modules where you can pretty much stock-up with any immunities you would like.<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Apocrypha, that's a nice improvement (+2 AB) over the original, but you can still make it better. Take the most important feats first as Max said (knockdown, expertise, WF &amp; blind fight) and leave (toughess, dodge &amp; mobillity) for later in the build. You also need to take your first SD level at 22nd and the last one at 37th for maximum efficiency. Take another FE with your ranger 20th level feat and take epic prowess with a fighter bonus one if you can, either alter the spread to 26/ 12/ 2 OR start with 16 strength by reducing your CON by two points. Skills, looking good, you can buff \"stealth\" with your spells as you have already said yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n On the other hand, if you make this a Ranger 26/ CoT 10/ SD 4, you can keep all your SD levels and still finish on a 32 STR without altering your starting abilities at all. It's a trade-off between your ws/ ews and the enhanced saves of CoT, and seeing as you don't even have spellcraft in your build, those might come in handy. Regardless, i would also consider changing your starting abilities to (Con 14, Dex 14, Int 14) for two reasons. The first would be that with 14 starting Dex you could eventually reach 26 Dex with enchantments &amp; your cat's grace, thuss allowing you to max-out your ac in padded armour to equal that of a full plate's, provided that you have uncanny dodge (and you have). The second reason is that you desperately need more skill points for maxing-out your stealth skills but also for cross-classing spellcraft or put some points to set traps/ animal empathy if you feel like it.<br/>\n<br/>\n Hope i helped,</div>"

      "content": "<div>Again, it's a great improvement of the first version! But, there are some mild adjustments that could be made. Val gave you a great suggestion to drop CON by 2 and add 1 to DEX and 1 to INT. You have HiPS as a great defense mechanism if you're getting your ass whooped, and with those skill points, you can cap both Hide and Move Silently. Both Camouflage and Mass Camouflage only help with Hide, not Move Silently. And I would swap Toughness with Mobility. Other than that, it's looking GOOD!<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div>"
