      "content": "<div>From the darkness the Black Arrow strikes with powers both divine and arcane, twisted faith meets deadly craft. Divine damage hurts, and this guy deals a lot of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nShout out to Mick for his Holy Elven Archer, the top dog for divine damage. It's a great build but I just couldn't see those attention seeking goody two-shoes bragging about keeping distance and peppering the enemy with arrows. I also didn't care for what paladin gave levels 4-9. So as always I set out to be a little bit more greedy and a lot more evil. (Yes I saw your Divine Bomber after I submitted this)<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm still on my alignment kick which means more Bard/BG combos. This guy has great saves, damage, AB, and enough Bard goodies to make him competitive in almost any situation. While slightly more conservative than Mick's he still packs a devastating quiver. The early levels in bard will see you through nicely as well. Self buffing is great as is UMD, and this guy has both. Want Monk shoes? Sure. Add in robes if you want too. You even have the important parts of Bard song (for you).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I went I slowly dropped more and more static defensive stats, relying more on the ample flexibility and mobility Bard offers. You won't want to be too close, but at least you can get gone if needed. Invisibility, expeditious retreat, haste, <br/>\nsummons, and my favorite: grease (not the worst DC considering no spell focus 0_0 ) give you tools for controlling your position early on until your sheer damage and stealth kick in. Add in Divine Might and you can drop bosses before they figure out which way is up. I left his Dex at 18 to take advantage of no spell failure chain shirts, but this can be adjusted. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere he is:<br/>\n<br/>\nBlack Arrow<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/201901/10759017_74ec73dda390b0086180581319443d98.jpg\"/><img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/201901/10759017_6f3897aa55407ecfde6a3ea7e276683e.jpg\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBlackguard(3), Bard(10), Arcane Archer(27), Elf<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nSTR: 14<br/>\nDEX: 16 (18)<br/>\nCON: 10<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 12<br/>\nCHA: 16 (32)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nElf: (Hardiness vs. Enchantments, Keen Sense, Low-light Vision, Skill Affinity: Listen, Skill Affinity: Search, Skill Affinity: Spot, Sleeplessness)<br/>\n01: Bard(1): Point Blank Shot<br/>\n02: Bard(2)<br/>\n03: Bard(3): Rapid Shot<br/>\n04: Bard(4): CHA+1, (CHA=17)<br/>\n05: Bard(5)<br/>\n06: Bard(6): Weapon Focus: Longbow<br/>\n07: Bard(7)<br/>\n08: Bard(8): CHA+1, (CHA=18)<br/>\n09: Arcane Archer(1): Called Shot<br/>\n10: Arcane Archer(2)<br/>\n11: Arcane Archer(3)<br/>\n12: Arcane Archer(4): CHA+1, Power Attack, (CHA=19)<br/>\n13: Arcane Archer(5)<br/>\n14: Arcane Archer(6)<br/>\n15: Arcane Archer(7): Cleave<br/>\n16: Blackguard(1): CHA+1, (CHA=20)<br/>\n17: Blackguard(2): {Smite Good}<br/>\n18: Blackguard(3): Divine Might<br/>\n19: Arcane Archer(8)<br/>\n20: Arcane Archer(9): CHA+1, (CHA=21)<br/>\n21: Arcane Archer(10): Improved Critical: Longbow<br/>\n22: Arcane Archer(11)<br/>\n23: Arcane Archer(12)<br/>\n24: Arcane Archer(13): CHA+1, Great Charisma I, (CHA=23)<br/>\n25: Arcane Archer(14): Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow<br/>\n26: Arcane Archer(15)<br/>\n27: Arcane Archer(16): Great Charisma II, (CHA=24)<br/>\n28: Arcane Archer(17): CHA+1, (CHA=25)<br/>\n29: Arcane Archer(18): Epic Prowess<br/>\n30: Arcane Archer(19): Great Charisma III, (CHA=26)<br/>\n31: Arcane Archer(20)<br/>\n32: Arcane Archer(21): CHA+1, (CHA=27)<br/>\n33: Arcane Archer(22): Great Charisma IV, Great Dexterity I, (DEX=17), (CHA=28)<br/>\n34: Arcane Archer(23)<br/>\n35: Arcane Archer(24)<br/>\n36: Arcane Archer(25): CHA+1, Great Charisma V, (CHA=30)<br/>\n37: Bard(9)<br/>\n38: Arcane Archer(26): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=18)<br/>\n39: Arcane Archer(27): Great Charisma VI, (CHA=31)<br/>\n40: Bard(10): CHA+1, (CHA=32)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHitpoints: 306<br/>\nSkillpoints: 209<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 32/30/38<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8, Mind Effects: +2<br/>\nBAB: 28<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 31 (melee), 50 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 22/30<br/>\nSpell Casting: Bard(4)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHide 43(47), Move Silently 43(47), Perform 6(17), Spellcraft 43(44), Tumble 40(44), UMD 34(45)</div>"
