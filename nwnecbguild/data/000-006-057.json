      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hello All<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I've finally done it: I've played a battle-cleric through to level 37 (Aielund). And it is with a heavy heart that I have to say...I didn't hate it. This is probably down to the fact that I could mostly play her as a straight-up meleer. I did have to remember to buff every time I woke up, and I can't profess that I made full use of her short-term enhancements (primarily because I forgot), but by and large there wasn't as much faffing as I'd feared, so that was good. Oh, and I won't pretend I soloed her, having two companions throughout the campaign. Nevertheless, I think room can be made for her in this august forum. Just don't tell anyone else (especially Max), alright?<br/>\n<br/>\nDancing Sunbeam first emerged in the Build Request forum as <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/viewtopic.php?p=23704#p23704\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dancing Sunbeam</a>, where she began life as a Barbarian/ Cleric/ CoT. She would have resided there for eternity were it not for the patient counsel of Max (in particular) and others, to whom my gratitude goes in spades. There were two builds with similar classes and splits in the Guild Filter:\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-divinae-auxilium-cleric-26-cot-10-rogue-4-t515404.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Divinae Auxilium</a> by foojin (Cleric 26/ Rogue 4/ CoT 10) is the first, but is a DEX Zen Archer; while the second is\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/linu-la-neral-cleric-29-cot-10-bard-1-t2269037.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Linu La'neral</a> from Max, our very own Cleric-master, and is his interpretation of the OC's clumsy elf Cleric sidekick and is a Cleric 29/ CoT 10/ Bard 1. Linu is very nicely done, but also has a CHA boost so is stretched a bit thinner stat-wise.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are an inveterate melee-merchant like me, this might actually be a Cleric starter kit you could use. She's a Cleric for folk who don't like Clerics.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee what you think.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Dancing Sunbeam</strong><br/>\nCleric 29/ Rogue 3/ CoT 8<br/>\nHuman - any non-evil<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Stats</strong><br/>\nSTR 16 (30)<br/>\nDEX 10<br/>\nCON 14<br/>\nWIS 14 (20)<br/>\nINT 14<br/>\nCHA 8<br/>\n<br/>\nHPs: 450<br/>\nAC: (naked) 20, (full plate) 28, (+tower shield) 31<br/>\nSaves: Fortitude 31, Will 30, Reflex 24. +8 v spells<br/>\nSneak Attack: 2d6+10<br/>\nSpells: Cleric 9, UMD<br/>\nBAB: 25 (3 APR)<br/>\nAB: (max, melee) 39, (ranged) 26<br/>\nSkill Points: 251.
