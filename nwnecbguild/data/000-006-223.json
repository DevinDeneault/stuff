      "content": "<div>Hail, mighty ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\nI come to you today with another build that has been in the works for some time now. I like the idea of a scary little man a lot, so I thought of the Barbarian / Rogue combo for a Halfling as a good starting point. Here are the synergies I see in this class combo:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- Terrifying Rage makes them run, then you Sneak the crap out of them as you chase them without worrying too much about getting hit. Barbarian Fast Movement makes it so that you always catch up unless they're Monks.<br/>\n2- Rogues also have Intimidate as a class skill, which means you can keep Barbarian levels to a minimum of 15.<br/>\n3- Rogue bonus feats allow you to take Epic Skill focus for \"free\", and also Epic Dodge, which is to deal with snipers or mobs of high-willed or fear-immune monsters.<br/>\n4- Fighter comes in with the extra feats to get dual-wielding and EWS.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the idea of a berserker that moves fast as lightning while raging. I decided to drop KD because he's a halfling. To generate SAs early on, Darkness scrolls are the way to go. However, you should be able to go toe to toe with pretty much any single enemy or even a few mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole idea is: you snipe at them from afar until they get close, then switch weapons and SCREAM! They run, you chase.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, should be pretty fun to play this guy. I didn't take Set Trap because the goal is to make them \"run for their lives\", not run towards you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt first glance, it may look as though STR is the best way to go for this build, which is what most of the similar builds go for. I, on the other hand, went for a different approach. With 10d6 SA damage and ITWF, STR for me is just overkill. You become better at something you're already very good at. But what if you're facing a Paladin, or anyone with a Clarity potion, or even someone with high Will saves? That's where ED comes in. If you can sneak them, then you have no problem being a DEX toon, and if you can't, you can very well stand toe to toe with them with ED and Expertise. Options, I like to have options.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, here's the scariest most agile little man on Faerun: The Tiny Slick Berserker!<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbarian(15), Rogue(19), Fighter(6),

I recommend avoiding combat with any pally, though.\u00a0 <em>Aura of Courage</em> is the only fear immunity effect not negated by the bugged script so will waltz right through the rage aura and attack with impunity.</div></div>"
