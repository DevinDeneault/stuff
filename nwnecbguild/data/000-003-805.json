Use the remaining skill points to max spellcraft. Still has over 400hp so its all fine.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree taking LoH would possibly be more optimal, although being able to use any weapon in the game is also pretty useful too. I get annoyed by all those cool bastard swords that drop that I want to wield!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I made the change to put LoH in because why not.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nDual wielding a Double Axe would be interesting but the Dex to 15 requirement would mean finding 7 additional stat points, I viewed it as less powerful, dual wielding drops the AB by 2, also some reduced damage output against damage resistant opponents albeit offset by epic weapon specialisation and dev crit<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your comments on my draft!</div>"

What is the point of additional AC when trash-mob with 5 point in taunt can lower it by 6. My Bard/RDD/PM on WOG is running with perm -6 AC! (And he doesn't care xD) (And he is wearing 'Knockdown immunity' boots although he has full Discipline.) My newer character has +6 AC from RDD and full Concentration (and full Discipline - I'm still looking for an enemy with Disarm).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut...<br/>\n<br/>\nDwarf (16/8/16+2/8/16/8) beats a human by 2 points. And Half-orc... It just doesn't seem special. Take another STR build, change the race to half orc and look - MAGIC: +1 AB / DMG / DevCrit DC, minus HP, SP.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut...<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I'm complaining too much. It's just easier to build a half orc half dragon.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor comparison, dirty, Dirty blueprint:<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Fighter(18), Bard(2), Red Dragon Disciple(20), Half-Orc\nSTR: 18 (40)\nCON: 10 (12)\nINT: 14 (16)\n\n01:Fighter(1):Luck of Heroes, Weapon Proficiency Exotic\n03:Fighter(3):Ambidexterity\n05:Fighter(5\n07:Fighter(7\n09:Fighter(9):Improved Knockdown\n11:Fighter(11\n13:Fighter(13\n15:Fighter(15):Cleave\n17:Red Dragon Disciple(1\n19:Red Dragon Disciple(3\n21:Fighter(16): Overwhelming Critical: Two-Bladed Sword, Devastating Critical: Two-Bladed Sword\n23:Red Dragon Disciple(6)\n25:Red Dragon Disciple(8)\n27:Red Dragon Disciple(10): Great Strength I, (STR=33), (CHA=8)\n29:Fighter(18): Epic Weapon Specialization: Two-Bladed Sword\n31:Red Dragon Disciple(12)\n33:Red Dragon Disciple(14): Great Strength III, Armor Skin, (STR=37)\n35:Red Dragon Disciple(16)\n37:Bard(2)\n39:Red Dragon Disciple(19): Epic Fortitude\n\nSkillpoints: 190\nSaving Throw bonuses: \nAB (max, naked): 47 (melee), 31 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: \n</details>\nBut...<br/>\nCrit Immunity + EMA!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Good old fighter / bard / rdd, it is such a powerful combination. Dev crit at level 21!!!! Str 40 and Base AB 47 without trying!<br/>\n<br/>\nYes pale master gets Crit Immunity and EMA and/or Epic Warding which is the main good thing about it, its more 'tanky'. I like the fact the current build I made has 34 strength, dev crit and base 45 AB as well!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think one could drop discipline in favor of concentration in this build on WoG, but if I did it officially I might get in trouble with the ECB moderators for building for a specific environment (the builds are meant to be applicable 'in general' according to the rules I have read from the original forum) but yes just put on some knockdown immune boots (or helmet with UMD) and no need for discipline skill without any decent disarming enemies. Every third enemy on WoG seems to taunt me so that is a reasonable call. (Every second enemy and his dog casts greater dispelling on me)<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn't drop the strength any further. Half-orc is special for its 'high strength' and I wouldn't want to lose that special part of this build. For skill points human wins hands down sadly :)</div>"

The most frequent server in that respect is the lvl 30 PW, Arelith. And it is no secret that many of our builders are heavily influenced by the challenging environment on WoG too.<br/>\nBut if you make a build or a variant of a build geared towards a specific environment, you should be explicit about it, just so there is no doubt about what the purpose of the build or tweak is.</div>",
