It's plug and play for single player campaigns, no need to open the module or anything like that. I should clarify that in the OP and project description.\u00a0<br/>\nFor module creators that want to mess with the xp system I suggest using a more powerful XP overhaul system.\u00a0<br/>\n<blockquote><div>It looks like the NWN vault guys were much quicker at doing the tech stuff of installing the scripts etc than I was, in fact they seemed so impressed they uploaded it immediately? :)</div></blockquote>\nActually, a different solution that works for both v1.69 and and EE: So instead of using the exclusive-to-EE function AddEvent to call a script on a player character's Heartbeat Event (just a script that fires every 6 seconds) user TheBarbarian showed me a different script he had come up with (link to topic:\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://forum.neverwintervault.org/t/need-help-compiling-script-for-nwn-ee/2164/3\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://forum.neverwintervault.org/t/ne ... -ee/2164/3</a>)<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, he \"fakes\" the heart beat even with a function that calls it self with a delay in a loop if a flag value is present on the Player. It's simple and elegant and worked immediately when applied.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe beautiful thing is: Nothing is actually overridden. The script is it's completely own little thing and doesn't mess with anything other than the XPScale.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Question is: Who wants to open every Module they play and do that? And then remove it later if they don't like it? And what about the Module creator's vision?<br/>\n<br/>\nEasier just to do one console command.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
