      "content": "<div>Hola peeps,\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n ive Been sitting trying to wrap my head around creating an sneaky \"sniper\" type assassin on my rp server, ravenloft. This is a World with restrictions and where it take a lot of time and dedication to reach the higer Levels. i cant figure out if i should do a rogue, wizard, aa approach or barb/wiz/aa. I want to be able to pvp but pvm is a larger Factor on the server<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n to make it short im confused</div>"

      "content": "<div>Ravenloft is lvl 20 roleplay server with a gothic horror setting. They have a custom system where you get more feats than usual, and some of the skills are changed. Eg. Parry gives an AC bonus comparable to tumble under certain circumstances.<br/>\n The setting is low magic. Some crafted items are good, but it takes a lot of effort to aquire enough crafting skill.<br/>\n I think I have a rogue/ranger character there that I played to lvl 7 a couple of years ago. But I find it hard to give advice since I don't know how it is to play at higher levels there.<br/>\n If I should start a new character there and choose a power class, I would take paladin for melee, or cleric if I was in the mood to rp one.<br/>\n I believe that strength based is better than dex based there.<br/>\n Since levelling is slow, it becomes important to have a character that is ok to play at all levels.</div>",
