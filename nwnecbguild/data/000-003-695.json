Equip an item with True Seeing (they exist in WoG, I have 3 of them amongst my characters)\u00a0<br/>\n2. Haste -&gt; Time Stop -&gt; Potion of True Strike (instant AB +75) -&gt; Attack -&gt; Time Stop -&gt; Potion True Strike -&gt; Attack [continue sequence] until Devastating Critical is landed.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI think much depends on who gets the first Time Stop scroll off.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is much easier for Nightshade once that Bigby's lands however, Nightslayer does not have that luxury to seriously use Bigby's against Nightshade.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe item with True Seeing has limitations including an abysmal AC but would be, in my view, the best way to deal with the HiPS in Nightshade's arsenal.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn't go Scimitar based on feedback from Yogmister, he felt that a big two handed sword was necessary to penetrate any possible DR belts Nightslayer might have equipped, this was what scared him most when playing this Epic Dodging Monk/SD/UMD'er.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nNightshade might save a few dev crits and have a greater swordman's belt equipped, landing huge critical hit damage (x3) with two handed weaponmaster was felt to be the way to go, even if Dev crit doesn't occur, HP decimation will, finally ending the terror of Nightshade on the WoG PW server.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Further Edit 2:</strong><br/>\nOne other thought. Spell resistance on items. I usually ignore this, but would this be useful against Bigby's scrolls? Is this property lowerable with Mords/Breaches? Something I will want to read up on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Further Edit 3:</strong><br/>\nAnd I will partially answer my question. Maybe.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nHighest SR in items is 32. Bigby's 9 scrolls have CL 20.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSpell resistance check = d20 + caster level + spell penetration \u00a0vs. SR<br/>\n20 + d20 vs 32<br/>\n\u00a0= need to roll 12 or more to equal or beat SR which leads to spell succeeding.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the Nightslayer will need to equip a high SR item to defeat Nightshade.</div>"

What actually would do the best job of killing me?<br/>\n<br/>\nSuch a build might not exist, but it is an interesting intellectual exercise.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith all the failings of the Nightslayer you have brought up, I believe this is the best I can come up with, but I want to see what you can come up with, with your building knowledge and prowess. It doesn't matter if it fails, because it probably will.\u00a0 But at least the Nightslayer has a chance, unlike many other builds. Even if it is 10% with Time Stop/True Strike cheese, its better than 0%.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Edit:</strong><br/>\nOne other comment on HiPS<br/>\n<br/>\nIn detect mode, a player will detect stealth 5 times / second with 1d20 rolls + spot score vs hide.<br/>\nIn normal mode a player will detect stealth 5 times / second with 1d10 rolls + spot score vs hide.<br/>\nOn WoG HiPS is once every 6 seconds.<br/>\nTherefore detecting stealth is checked 30 times more often than one can HiPS, in a PvP situation in WoG.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoosting that spot score within 10-20 of Nightshade's Hide score will basically mean Nightshade is detected by Nightslayer and HiPS may be ineffective.<br/>\nI can boost spot a little higher by doing a F12/R3/WM25 at the cost of 1 AB, and dropping a little UMD, search, even the high value set trap/disable trap points.<br/>\nThe highest base modified Spot score is going to be 42, which could be boosted by items (ie Watchman's Helm) meaning that a True Sight item might not be completely essential, to defeat Nightshade's HiPS.</div>"

      "content": "<div>There are some issues with the offence of a Monk/SD but if properly built the defences are amazing. The build isn't completely invincible but most of the tactics that will work against it are either banned on PvP servers or are unreliable. It also depends on the size of the arena and whether the Monk/SD is actively trying to kill your build or just survive.<br/>\nMaking a build that a Monk/SD will struggle to kill isn't too hard, making a build that can reliably kill a Monk/SD is.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuivering Palm can only be used on lower level targets so in a 40 vs 40 PvP battle it won't work.<br/>\nDeath Attack actually isn't a problem for this build since you can spam WWA to prevent the paralysis roll. However, if you spam WWA then you won't be able to attack when the Monk/SD hits you and HiPS spam will gradually kill you before you can even land a hit.<br/>\nRegarding 32 SR, a Mords will reduce that to 22 SR at which point a Bigby9 scroll will have a 95% chance of beating your SR. If you have Freedom or Mind Spell Immunity and Mords scrolls then that will be less of a concern, but those buffs will have to be on items since a Mords will dispel them otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nI assume that you have never faced a HiPS build played by a competent player in PvP before? With +12 DEX a Monk/SD will have around 60 Hide/MS which can be beaten pretty easily by a dedicated spotter (assuming that there are an equal amount of Hide items and Spot items), but only a dedicated spotter can reliably spot a HiPSer. If you are not an elf spotter or if you do not have vanilla True Seeing then you will not touch a properly built HiPSer, even with a 6 second HiPS timer. If the HiPS timer was 2 or 3 rounds then you might have a chance, but due to how detect works you won't be able to spot a HiPSer with this build.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny decent melee build with access to Mords, vanilla Time Stop, and vanilla True Seeing will be able to kill it.<br/>\nFairly self-explanatory, True Seeing to prevent hiding in HiPS, Mords to dispel GSanc, Time Stop to stop time. Without True Seeing the Monk/SD can HiPS as soon as you start reading the scroll and you will struggle to detect them. This is less of an issue with a melee spotter, a properly built spotter should be able to detect the Monk/SD. Without Mords you can't dispel Gsanc, so you will either need to get lucky catching the Monk/SD out of GSanc or carry enough scrolls to keep time stopped until GSanc runs out. Without Time Stop this tactic is worthless. Since this is PvP the Monk/SD also has access to this tactic so it's not exactly reliable. Note that you can't simultaneously spam Time Stop scrolls and melee without messing up your timing, as soon as the first Time Stop is over the Monk/SD will be able to Time Stop you before you can use another scroll. Whoever casts Time Stop first wins, for obvious reasons this would not be a valid tactic on a balanced PvP server.<br/>\nExample builds: Cler28/Bard2/RDD10, Figh14/WM25/Bard1, Figh16/WM7/Wiz17.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttacking from stealth can potentially work if you get very lucky or are fighting in a small area.<br/>\nThis won't work if vanilla True Seeing is available or if the Monk/SD is able to run away. If the Monk/SD runs right past you while you are in stealth and you can click them before they zoom off you might be able to get 1 flurry in, if you can get past the high AC, 50% concealment, and Epic Dodge. Overall, not very reliable but it might work on a non-elf Monk/SD in an enclosed area.<br/>\nExample build: Rog13/Rang26/SD1.<br/>\n<br/>\nStacking 10 epic traps on one spot and luring the Monk/SD over them can work.<br/>\nYou have to stack enough traps for a OHK or it can just run away and heal. If the Monk/SD knows that you are using this tactic then there are multiple ways for them to disrupt it so it's still not a reliable tactic. It might work a few times but once the Monk/SD knows what you are doing and adapts to it you will have to get lucky to kill them.<br/>\nExample build: Rog19/Bard5/PM16.<br/>\n<br/>\nA high caster level mage with ESPen can potentially work.<br/>\nA pure Sorc40 or Wiz40 with ESPen has a 30% chance (potentially 20% chance) of beating the SR of a Monk35/SD5 and a 35% chance of beating the SR of a UMD variant. 38 or 39 caster levels are acceptable but I would avoid going below that, even though it means forfeiting 3 monk levels. You will need to have vanilla True Seeing or be an elf spotter in order to actually target the Monk/SD. Bigby6 is the only useful disabling spell against a Monk/SD and you will have to get past both SR and mantles in order to land it. If vanilla Time Stop is availably then alternating between Time Stop and nuke spells can work too. If the Monk/SD approaches in GSanc then you won't have any idea of where they are until they breach your shields and KD spam you to death.<br/>\nIf the Monk/SD has access to knockdown immunity, you lose. If you run out of Bigby6, you lose. If you don't have vanilla True Seeing or are not a dedicated spotter, you lose. If the area has plenty of corners that can be used to break your LoS, you lose. If you neglect discipline and fortitude, you lose.<br/>\nThis still isn't a reliable victory but it's probably your best option.<br/>\nExample builds: Sorc38/Pal1/Monk1, Sorc40, Wiz39/Rang1.</div>"

Casters are not really the solution to Nightshade.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe epic trap idea sounds sensible, and perhaps a large stack of epic frost traps (which don't take into account evasion) would do the trick.

      "content": "<div>The build is a Monk34/SD5/Ass1 with Epic Dodge and high SR. I don't believe that webshaman1's specific build has been posted online but there are very few ways to make a decent Monk/SD so it's not hard to guess\u00a0 what the build could be.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou're assuming that a Monk/SD will HiPS and then walk towards you in stealth mode to attack you. That might be how you use it in PvM and that might be how NPCs use it, but that is not how PvP HiPSers use HiPS. It is also why a 1 round HiPS timer does not matter at all to a competent player in PvP. Immediately after they HiPS you will have an action cancel, triggering this cancel is the key use of HiPS in PvP.<br/>\nHiPS actually works better on PCs than NPCs because of how often PCs detect. I have made 127 Spot elf builds that will sometimes lose track of 115ish Hide characters due to how detect works. Even if you have 80 Spot and are fighting a 60 Hide HiPSer, if you're not an elf it won't matter. If you don't have Keen Senses and are not in detect mode then your Spot is halved when rolling, not even 80 Spot will help you.<br/>\nIf a HiPSer attacks you you will have a -10 Spot modifier even if you don't fight back. The HiPSer will then disengage straight after the first flurry and run away. This negative modifier will last for 1 round, when the HiPSer is free to HiPS again. If the HiPSer is smart then they will also use summons such as Elemental Swarm to force you into combat even after they have disengaged. Elf helps here since they are in constant detect mode and so combat has less of an effect, although they will still have a -10 Spot modifier. A non-elf without vanilla True Seeing is not able to compete with a competently built and played HiPSer. If you don't build to fight a HiPSer you will lose, that's part of what makes the feat so OP and is why it gets nerfed on so many servers.<br/>\n<br/>\nArchers won't work since they have to deal with high AC, Epic Dodge, Deflect Arrows, 50% concealment, and UMD. You can build for detect or have vanilla True Seeing, but unless you're a Monk/AA the Monk/SD will be able to hit you in melee without HiPS spamming. A Monk/SD can use HiPS to cancel your attacks, run in IExp to get into melee range, and then use melee or UMD to finish the archer off. A Monk/AA is the best option since they have the AC to semi-tank the Monk/SDs AB but ultimately the Monk/SD can still win by (ab)using UMD.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can have 67 SR and you can have Epic Dodge but you can't have both at the same time. A Monk35/SD5 will have 61 SR if it takes Armor Skin or 63 SR if it focuses on SR. A Monk34/SD5/Ass1 or Monk34/SD5/Rog1 will have 60 SR. A Sorc39/Pal1 with ESPen will have a 30% chance of beating the SR of a Monk34/SD5/Ass1. If vanilla True Seeing is available then that's probably your best bet against a Monk/SD in an enclosed area, although it's still not a reliable counter for reasons given above.</div>"
