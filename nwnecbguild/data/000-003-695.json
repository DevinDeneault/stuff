      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I suggest dropping DEX by 2 in order to even out your CON and WIS. -1 AB and -1 AC vs 40 HP and another level 7 slot when fully buffed is a decent trade in my opinion. This would also allow you to access level 7 and 8 spells earlier by reshuffling ability increases and feats, although you may have to delay EDR3 in order to achieve that. Even if you stick with your current abilities I would still recommend delaying EDR in order to reach level 7 spells at level 15.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would delay your first CoT level to level 19 even though it means delaying your Spot dump. Despite not having access to level 7 and 8 spells your Cleric levels are more important early on since they give increased duration, extra slots, and better buffs. Also I would move your second Rogue level to level 13 in order to get level 6 spells as soon as possible. In addition to Extended Haste it has Harm, Heal, and Greater Sanctuary.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis build doesn't have Silent Spell, possibly the most important metamagic feat for a healer. I'm not sure what I would recommend dropping for it, probably Empower Spell or Scribe Scroll.<br/>\n<br/>\nA very minor thing, I would drop 2 Search or Spot ranks to increase your UMD to 36. However I know this is a WoG build so I'm not sure if 35 UMD is needed there.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything else looks great. Extended Divine Power will cover the low STR at higher levels although the early levels will be rough.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Have abandoned the concept of a shield until now.<br/>\n- Heavy crossbow / Short Sword is what I am using<br/>\n- 1d6 sneak is helpful<br/>\n- Spot is great in this build combined with the small stature, this little fellow can see things from a mile away.<br/>\n- I built him as a party tank + buffer, most of the buffs are spell levels 1-6 so I've prioritised a few levels of EDR before higher level spells<br/>\n- I like the Withered Wee One RP idea. Or maybe the crippled hobbit cleric tank? I shall have to develop this idea and others further!<br/>\n<br/>\n<em class=\"mention\">@Yunim</em>\u00a0<br/>\n- Great suggestions as always<br/>\n- As discussed early levels are fine, its a cleric, the powerhouse class of low-mid magic<br/>\n- Agree with CT 1 at level 19, better to rush Cleric 15 before taking CT 1, this is something I will change in my build<br/>\n- Tried to fit silent spell into the build. Do you think Silent Spell &gt; Empower Spell here? Keen to hear from some more dedicated cleric players.<br/>\n- I like scribe scroll on clerics for heal scrolls, Summon IX scrolls etc (share it with your UMD teammates who will LOVE you). I wish SoV could be scribed.<br/>\n- UMD 33 I just arbitarily place on my builds for casting all spells without failure in case that is in place in the module played. I write the builds so it can be as optimal as possible in all locations (single player / PW -&gt; thats why I try to avoid/minimise exp penalties for single player modules where exp can be limited) it can be adjusted as desired. On WoG even less is enough, modified 30 is more than enough.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You need to delay your high level cleric spells on a Cleric focused build to spend the bonus feats on Wisdom.\u00a0 This is a QOL issue and, to be fair,\u00a0 not generally something I would consider important assuming you reach a solid end point advantage.<br/>\n2. You sacrifice too many melee class feats (Fighter/CoT) which damages/limits your battle cleric capabilities.\u00a0 This is a build flaw and this is more difficult to justify than a levelling QOL issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nEssentially, the build lacks a Battle Cleric AB and extra feat benefits (knockdown, improved critical,\u00a0 Devcrit) and lacks a caster cleric DC and I am not sure what it gains in return.<br/>\n<br/>\nFurther, a Dex build in this case subtracts more than it adds IMO as you do not reach the level needed to make wearing DEX armor useful and you have another physical stat you need to cap whilst leaving you woefully underrepresented in Strength.\u00a0 With a Strength build, you net the same AB and more importantly Damage.\u00a0 You can also wear heavy armor, a tower shield and wield a weapon without consuming your entire capped strength weight allocation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my two cents.\u00a0 I personally would build this as 24 Cleric or possibly a 26 Cleric for a Battle Cleric build or I would go Zenarchery/Casting (Monk) and stand toe to toe with EDR. Defensive Casting whilst I tanked.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
