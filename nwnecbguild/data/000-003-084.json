      "content": "<div>Hey guys I was needing help building a dwarf for Arelith (30 cap.)<br/>\n<br/>\n My thoughts, (I don't exactly know if this is possible.) were on a Dwarven Defender.<br/>\n<br/>\n I thought that 10 Fighter/15 DD/ 5 COT Dwarf<br/>\n<br/>\n As to my reasoning to that spread? I thought the COT could help with saves. But, at the same time I was thinking more along the lines of 'Sturdy' dwarf?<br/>\n I thought a warhammer with a shield might be good (not sure if they can be used at the same time.)<br/>\n<br/>\n The spread I had was<br/>\n STR 15<br/>\n DEX 14<br/>\n CON 16<br/>\n Wis 12<br/>\n INT 14<br/>\n CHA 6<br/>\n<br/>\n But, beyond taking fighter the first level. I really don't know where to start (or even if I have a good spread. Maybe 4 COT or even just 3 would be more than enough.)<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>In vanilla with 6 charisma you don't get anything useful from the fifth cot level (divine wrath is unusable with low cha), so maybe four is enough. I would go something like 8 fighter / 4 cot / 18 dd. At least 7 fighter is needed for either cot and dd (7 bab prereq), and you get some goodies from that 18 dd - an extra feat and +3 dr. Another spread could be 8 fighter / 8 cot / 14 dd, for one more feat and better saves, but a small loss in dr.<br/>\n Warhammer-shield is possible for dwarven in vanilla, I don't know if arelith changed this.<br/>\n For starting abilities, something like this looks better to me:<br/>\n STR 16<br/>\n DEX 12<br/>\n CON 18<br/>\n WIS 8<br/>\n INT 14<br/>\n CHA 6<br/>\n<br/>\n EDIT: I realized that dodge is a prereq for dd, so 13 dex is a must... you could drop one point from int (16/13/18/8/13/6), or two from con and get one more str too (17/13/16/8/14/6).</div>"

It will help a bit more in the long run. I'd recommend Heal as a skill to focus in. Not sure how many points you'll get to work with. (I don't have the recommended tools, since I cant use the build calculator.) I'd say invest in spot, your more likely to find 'stealthed' enemies than invisible ones, but it can't go too high since COT is taken early. So, Listen may be your best subsitute.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for the called shot.<br/>\n<br/>\n Better off replacing it for Knockdown and getting IKD later in the build.<br/>\n<br/>\n Called shot is good, for weakening enemies before they come close. But, you'll find that depending on your enemies it won't do too much good. I'd say it is very situational (when you get a rare 1 on 1 fight, not a 5 on 1 etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\n Part of me can't help that instead of COT you should've opted for Rogue levels instead. For a UMD and Tumble dumps. You'd have sacrificed on your will save a bit, but also increased your reflex I imagine.But, I'd imagine Clarity (from scrolls/potions) would have balanced the will saves out. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.</div></div>"

What would Rogue bring to the build?<br/>\n 1- Use Magic Device (UMD). That would allow your character to buff himself up with scrolls and wands and equip class-specific gear, such as Monk boots. MAJOR BOOST<br/>\n 2- Tumble as a Class Skill. (The AC isn't that vital, though, as this guy tanks\u00a0with DR, not AC). meh<br/>\n 3- A few extra skill points and a MUCH BETTER SKILLSET to pick from. Unfortunately, this build doesn't have nearly enough skill points to take advantage of the Rogue skillset.<br/>\n 4- EVASION! Deserving capital letters! All traps would have a chance of not doing damage to you.<br/>\n 5- A mild Sneak Attack damage bonus. meh again<br/>\n<br/>\n What does Rogue cost this build? 2 Feats (Cot 2 and 4) (which this guy can afford). Drop Expertise and Called Shot. You have Defensive Stance, which is better than Expertise, and you're a CON monster, so you don't have such a high AB that you can afford losing 5 points to have higher AC. You tank with DR, not AC!<br/>\n<br/>\n As for Rua's and hunaero's exchange, let me say this. Rua, if keeping the build as is, with the crappy skillset that he has to choose from, I would not drop ANYTHING for INT or DEX, because DwDs are immune to Sneak Attacks, so no need to spot sneakers. However, IF you bring in Rogue, your suggestion is SPOT ON!<br/>\n<br/>\n Hunaero, he's absolutely right about Called Shot, drop that thing! You can't afford the AB having spent so many points in CON to consistently nerf your opponents. It's better to have just KD and be better at it than to have both and barely land a hit. Maybe your AB is high enough to hit with CS on the first attack each round, but from that point on you'll most likely miss, making the feat questionable to say the least.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also KD is WAY more important than Improved Critical, simply because to crit you need to hit your threat roll to apply the bonus damage, and again, that AB is only average. You're a tank, not a heavy hitter. I would even drop IC if I had something better to swap it for. So Take KD ASAP (Level 3) and delay IC (if you take it at all) to level 18.<br/>\n<br/>\n Does this all make sense?</div></div>"

What would Rogue bring to the build?<br/>\n 1- Use Magic Device (UMD). That would allow your character to buff himself up with scrolls and wands and equip class-specific gear, such as Monk boots. MAJOR BOOST<br/>\n 2- Tumble as a Class Skill. (The AC isn't that vital, though, as this guy tanks\u00a0with DR, not AC). meh<br/>\n 3- A few extra skill points and a MUCH BETTER SKILLSET to pick from. Unfortunately, this build doesn't have nearly enough skill points to take advantage of the Rogue skillset.<br/>\n 4- EVASION! Deserving capital letters! All traps would have a chance of not doing damage to you.<br/>\n 5- A mild Sneak Attack damage bonus. meh again<br/>\n<br/>\n What does Rogue cost this build? 2 Feats (Cot 2 and 4) (which this guy can afford). Drop Expertise and Called Shot. You have Defensive Stance, which is better than Expertise, and you're a CON monster, so you don't have such a high AB that you can afford losing 5 points to have higher AC. You tank with DR, not AC!<br/>\n<br/>\n As for Rua's and hunaero's exchange, let me say this. Rua, if keeping the build as is, with the crappy skillset that he has to choose from, I would not drop ANYTHING for INT or DEX, because DwDs are immune to Sneak Attacks, so no need to spot sneakers. However, IF you bring in Rogue, your suggestion is SPOT ON!<br/>\n<br/>\n Hunaero, he's absolutely right about Called Shot, drop that thing! You can't afford the AB having spent so many points in CON to consistently nerf your opponents. It's better to have just KD and be better at it than to have both and barely land a hit. Maybe your AB is high enough to hit with CS on the first attack each round, but from that point on you'll most likely miss, making the feat questionable to say the least.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also KD is WAY more important than Improved Critical, simply because to crit you need to hit your threat roll to apply the bonus damage, and again, that AB is only average. You're a tank, not a heavy hitter. I would even drop IC if I had something better to swap it for. So Take KD ASAP (Level 3) and delay IC (if you take it at all) to level 18.<br/>\n<br/>\n Does this all make sense?</div>\n</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">I don't have a way to calculate this stuff, or anything other than writing something on paper.

In terms of spread, I prefer the one Valehand posted, because it's more optimized. DwD gain DR based on how many levels of DwD you take, so you should aim for 18 DwD in any build scenario. If you want it to have UMD throughout, you can go 6/6/18 (I still prefer Vale's alternative, though, less playable, more powerful), but that would be a decent compromise of max lvl power for playability. You'd need to drop a feat. Lightning Reflexes looks like the one that needs to go. Other than that, go for EDR 3 ASAP, because it makes a HUGE difference when you take them. If possible, try to have all 3 EDR feats by level 25, taking the last one with a DwD bonus feat.<br/>\n<br/>\n Skills look sharp, although IDK why 7 Disable Traps. UMD is server-dependant, so IDK how much is OK for Arelith.<br/>\n<br/>\n About the pre-epic feats, you have the feats to spare and nothing better to take there. However, you might consider reworking Expertise in to save up Defensive Stances for important battles. You only use Expertise in EASY minion fights to have enough stances for the big guys. Anyway, either save-enhancing feats or Expertise are fine, because they're all \"extra\" anyway. You could even get Power Attack and Cleave for extra attacks against weaklings, it doesn't matter.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers!</div></div>"

Use an Eagle pot or 3 for Level 7-8 scrolls with likewise success.\u00a0 Level 9 scrolls will be an adventure, though, probably around 10-15% failure.\u00a0 So, no... definitely not overkill. <br/>\n<br/>\nSlide 5 points from Search to Disable trap which will allow you to recover many of them for stacking fields or for resale to the black market vendors (they usually pay especially well for all the gas traps).<br/>\n<br/>\nDTrap 16 + Take20 = DC 36 recoveries (like average Holy/Negative, deadly Frost and others).\u00a0 There are no recovery DCs lower than 32, btw.\u00a0 If you equip +INT gear and pre-buff with Fox pots, you'll be able to recover even more and the ability boost will also help spot them faster.<br/>\n<br/>\nDTrap of 16 will disarm all DCs of 36 and lower, with DC 36+ only disarmable by a rogue. A Search of 10 will reduce the spotting interval by about half.\u00a0 Not bad, but with 3-sec. Detect Mode, you should spot them within perception range fast enough.\u00a0 My rogues are usually disarming traps while in stealth mode <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">and</span> detect mode around the enemy ranks and have the speed reduced double... and that also helps to avoid triggering them before spotting them.\u00a0 If you use Invis, the stealth mode is mainly used to slow the move speed.\u00a0 BTW, that \"double slow\" tactic is used to stack traps in combination with encumbering your toon in on-line gaming.\u00a0 It's not necessary in SP because of the Pause key.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, this skill set will not stand a chance against Epic traps so let's hope those threats are not spread around very much.\u00a0 They really hurt!\u00a0 You'd need a reflex save on a DC 35 to survive an Epic Electrical and a Fort save vs. an Epic Frost of DC 30 (which ImpEvasion will not help at all).\u00a0 Success not likely.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuild looks pretty good, though.\u00a0 Being able to avoid all those AoOs and sneak attacks is a bonus when you plan to wade into the mob.\u00a0 Good luck!<br/>\n<em><br/>\nedit:\u00a0 Hmmm... just learned something about the quoting business.\u00a0 Seems that if you select a line or two from a section within the spoiler range, the quote comes up blank (</em><strong>TAKE HEED STAGMEISTER!</strong><em>).\u00a0 So I had to open it up as HTML to remove the spoiler tag and now all is back as how I intended.\u00a0 It's because the opening spoiler tag automatically opens the quote but the closing tag was left behind so the editor, confused, can't figure out what to do.\u00a0 There's always another trick!</em></div>"

Yes, it's tougher to work through the calculations, but it does give you a real feel for the build. You challenge every feat you take - the why and the when - as well as the sequencing of classes (admittedly, somewhat different with Arelith), so you know what you're trying to accomplish with it through and through. You also start to recognise what skills you need, and when you need them. I know I've been guilty of mucking up skills schedules before - and more than likely will be again - but environment is probably even more important when it comes to allocating skills than it is for feats (things like whether Dev Crit is disabled being excepted, obviously). It was the sainted Mick Dagger who impressed this upon me (I really don't want to say \"sainted\", given his proclivities, but when the alternative is \"damned\", I might get away with it), and made me realise that yes, feats might be sexier - big and shiny and with immediate impact - but skills maketh the man, so to speak. How you stand up to taunts and magic. Whether you can prevent your party being blown into tiny pieces. Whether you can blow your foes into said pieces. And for my money, the best way of doing it is to sit down with some paper and work it through. An easy example, and one I've used before, is get Disable Trap early on (if it's possible for you), because you may well glide unruffled over traps at later levels, but you'll end up a bloody mess at earlier ones.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm rambling about skills now, but what I really want to do is re-affirm that building on paper is not to be sniffed at. When you're a seasoned pro, fine, use the CBC. With those those eagle-eyes you'd spot soon enough if something jarred. But early on, and great for learning, the old ways are the best. Particularly when you have a Guild at your disposal to point and laugh - sorry, correct some inexactitudes!<br/>\n<br/>\n OR - I'm still a Luddite.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT: </strong></em>Everything I'm doing here at the moment is being ninja'd!

Delaying the fighter level wouldn't be the end of the world. At the same time pushing EDR back as well in counter balance, wouldn't be the worst thing either. UMD can be consider important. But, when thinking about Set Trap. It's always a want not a need, before other skills. It's nice to have, but it can always be forgotten (Unless, you're a rogue. What kinda rogue can't set traps. You disgrace ya whole brothahood!)<br/>\n<br/>\n Your suggestion is noteworthy. Push the Fighter back a bit. Or simply take the EDR at a slightly later date. The DD has a natural form of DR. So, holding off tanking capabilities for a few levels, so long as they are taken won't make or break it.</div></div>"

However, one could argue that there might be more important skills to take compared to it. (i.e some just preference, such as appraise, or bluff, etc.) Set Trap, good. If you have the skill points to spend, and have the other bases covered (Discipline, Tumble, etc) It's definitely a good fall back in the case for some reason, hitting it till it dies doesn't work.<br/>\n<br/>\n You know, unless that there new player accidentally runs into it. Kaboom.. personal experience... though it was set maliciously to get all my gold without a trace, not actual combat. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm here debating whether or not I should bother with Concentration to avoid potential taunters. Set Trap can afford to have a few points in it. Open Lock, probably a bit more as well like 5-6. But, I have no way of calculating the skill points I have to spend. Hence, why I said 'Set Trap' would have to be a wait and see skill.</div></div>"

A dwarven wall setting traps just seems wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n The saves-enhancing feats seem to be part of your concept, so it's OK to keep them, although I wonder how often you'll succeed a save that you'd otherwise fail due to having them.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">I did take your advice into consideration.I'll give her another go though</div></div>"

I think.<br/>\n<br/>\n Divine damage, I have no idea honestly. They have a gift for elemental resistances 5% off each type of damage I believe, don't know how far it extends, and personally, since it can't stack with anything, not worth it.

Though, with it I'd be giving 16 INT down to 14 again. Which is fine, only.. I don't know how many points I'd have to work with then. Someone said 189 with the 16. But, I think your suggestion is probably good. If it does regain what prowess gives. A strength, in comparison gives damage, carry weight, more AB (I guess) and Disc. The Prowess just gives 1+ to all forms of attacks. So, it doesn't seem that hard to do. (I don't have a way to use the CBC so any idea how many skill points I'd have to work with?)</div></div>"

      "content": "<div>Just as a quick guide - from one who also doesn't use CBC - you'll get 2 skill points to distribute for every level of DwD and Fighter and 8 for every level of Rogue (all plus the INT modifier, and character level 1 taking four times the usual amount). If you played as human (impossible in this case), you'd get an extra 1 point per level regardless of class.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thus, with an INT of 14 (+2),4\u00a0 levels of Rogue gets you 40 skill points, and 26 levels of DwD/Fighter garners you 100 (25 multiplied by 4) plus 16 from Fighter at level 1. So 156.<br/>\n<br/>\n If you took Rogue as the first level (or 3, in Arileth), you'd have 30 points from 3 \"ordinary\" Rogue levels plus 40 from level 1, and 104 (26 multiplied by 4) from the other two classes. So 174.<br/>\n<br/>\n Them's the basics. If there are other modifiers you need to factor in, please do!<br/>\n<br/>\n (And, gods, I hope I'm right here)</div>",
