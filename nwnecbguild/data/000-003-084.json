One I've just noticed that might be a good fit, although I don't think it's Arelith-specific, is Valerfor's Knight of the Throne. The link is <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwn</a><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://ecbguild.forumer.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ecbguild.forumer.com</a>/topic/2354289/Knight-Of-The-Throne-Fighter-10-Rogue-5-CoT-15#.WLrkwTi6Mqg<br/>\n<br/>\n I hope that works, but if not it's easy enough to find on the first page of that sub-forum, or, indeed in HipRedux's ECB Filter, available via a link in the Tools sub-forum.<br/>\n<br/>\n The build is a Fighter 10 / Rogue 5 / CoT 15, thus many feats and good saves. And as a bonus, Valerfor has constructed it with a bastard sword. Have a look and see what you think!<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">If you like that build concept, and if I'm right in what I'm about to say (a big if), it might not be too hard.<br/>\n<br/>\n If you take the first 3 levels as Fighter, then the next 3 as Rogue, I reckon you'd still be ok to take CoT as indicated. Admittedly, you'd lose 24 skills points (I think), but I reckon dropping 2 from UMD (leaving a nett 33, which I believe is the magic number), 8 from Search, drop all 4 from Open Lock, 5 from Disable Trap and 5 from Heal, that should do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n What it would also mean, assuming you still wanted Skill Focus in UMD, you'd have to shift Rogue 4 to level 18. But that's not a huge problem, particularly given that you'd then be taking CoT at level 12 and thus keeping Skill Focus: Discipline where initially intended. If you still wanted Toughness, you could grab it at level 15 (although, personally, I'd drop it for Iron Will). And I'm not entirely sure why Improved Power Attack is in there: maybe Valerfor can let us know?<br/>\n<br/>\n Before you embark on this as a build, I'd wait for someone better qualified than I to come along and verify or otherwise what I've suggested.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
