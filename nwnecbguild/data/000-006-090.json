he was merely the Point B.\u00a0 I had to go find point A.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nAnd I did.\u00a0 And I was good at it.\u00a0 I would bring him all sorts of bodies: sick ones, old ones, youths struck down in their prime, those who died a violent death or those who died on their own vomit from excess drink.\u00a0 Usually they were human, but on occasion I found a dwarf, or some halflings.\u00a0 I found some that I still don\u2019t know what they were.\u00a0 But life was cheap, and men and women died like cattle, it seemed, and no one ever asked why.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nIt started small like this.\u00a0 Just carting dead bodies to whoever had the coin.\u00a0 After several months of this, I once lingered in the basement where the physic took the bodies I carted.\u00a0 Perhaps it was curiosity, perhaps it was fascination, perhaps I was just a bored twelve year old boy, but I lingered once.\u00a0 And I watched.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nI watched the physic cut the body open, from stem to stern.\u00a0 I watched him slice the head open and peer inside as if he were looking for some hidden secret.\u00a0 I watched him insert pale silver hooks and prods into the grey goo inside the head as if he were learning to see what made the body go.\u00a0 I heard him mutter, \u201cWhere is it\u2026\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0There were long needles and blades that gleamed cold in the lantern light, and the shadows danced on the walls behind him like some deathly audience in silent celebration.\u00a0 More than once I spied the body, cold and lifeless on the stone slab, twitch and jerk on its own as the physic performed his study of vivisectionary.\u00a0 <br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nIt was not long before the physic knew I was there, watching, observing from the shadows, the macabre scene that he painted on the stone slab before me.\u00a0 Or perhaps he knew I was there all along.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHe never said a word, but just looked at me and motioned for me to his side.\u00a0 <br/>\nI asked him, \u201cWhat is it, sir, that you do with them?\u201d<br/>\n\u201cI learn,\u201d was all he said to me.\u00a0 And he continued on like this, after every body, deep into the night until the sun began to creep over the walls of the city.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd one day I realized I was no longer panhandling.\u00a0 I was no longer running odd jobs, or trying to glean information for the Beggar\u2019s Guild, or earning coin for the Thieves\u2019 Guild, or dodging reproachful glances from the City Watch.\u00a0 I worked exclusively for the physic.\u00a0 Every day I would bring him a body.\u00a0 Sometimes twice a day. And he paid me very well.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nLike most things, it started small.\u00a0 As I grew older I began to understand what it was he was searching for.\u00a0 He was searching for life itself, but more, he was searching for life after death. Or was it a life in death?\u00a0 As I grew older he confided me, and shared his secrets, his ingredients, his cantrips and minor medical miracles that he could do. \u00a0But he warned me that such knowledge could be considered blasphemy by some, so \u201cnever reveal your study, your research, the mysteries that you unravel,\u201d he warned me.\u00a0 <br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nI grew rich in knowledge.\u00a0 I learned how the body works.\u00a0 I knew where the blood pumped and where the blood flowed.\u00a0 I learned which tendon to slice to cripple a man, and I learned how to repair that tendon.\u00a0 I learned which incantations, which rituals, which words in languages no longer spoken, would re-animate those whose lights were extinguished.\u00a0 And eventually and over many, many years, I learned to master this craft, this study and detail of death and life and that moment in between.\u00a0 I learned this and more, so much so that my body itself had become corrupted by this study.\u00a0 My arm was no longer my arm.\u00a0 It slowly became gangrenous and then skeletalized.\u00a0 But while the rest of my body hardened and became skeletalized, only the flesh on my arm flaked away to reveal only the bone beneath.\u00a0 It was the arm I used for the incantations, for the rituals, for the vivisections.\u00a0 At first I thought it was the consequence, a price to be paid for the dark follies and midnight reveries I engaged in, in the corpses I trafficked as currency.\u00a0\u00a0 But as I grew more powerful, more proficient, I realized I was wrong.\u00a0 It was not a consequence; it was a doorway, a portal, a direct connection to the grave itself, and to all things buried and below ground!\u00a0 <br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nLike most things in life, it started small\u2026.<br/>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong><br/>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong><br/>\n<strong>The Vivisectionist \u00a0(WoG Version) </strong><br/>\nClasses: Fighter6/Wizard4/Palemaster30<br/>\nRace: Human (<em>dwarf and elf work as well</em>)<br/>\nPlayable: 1-40 (<em>war-tested in the battlefields and Underdark of WoG</em>)<br/>\nAlignment: Any Non-Good<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Attributes</span></strong><br/>\nStr16 (30)<br/>\nInt18 (19)<br/>\nWis8<br/>\nDex8<br/>\nCon12<br/>\nChr8<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Level Guide</span></strong><br/>\n1 Fighter1, Strong Soul, LoH, Exotic Weaponry<br/>\n2 Wizard1, Spell School: Illusion<br/>\n3 Wizard2, WF: Mercurial Longsword<br/>\n4 Wizard3, Str17<br/>\n5 Fighter2, Blindfighting<br/>\n6 Fighter3, Knockdown<br/>\n7 Fighter4, WS: Mercurial Longsword<br/>\n8 PM1, Str18<br/>\n9 PM2, Extend Spell<br/>\n10 PM3<br/>\n11 PM4, Darkvision, <em>Ghoul</em><br/>\n12 PM5, IKD, Str19<br/>\n13 PM6, <em>Shadow</em><br/>\n14 PM7, <em>Ghast</em><br/>\n15 PM8, Toughness, <em>Wight</em><br/>\n16 PM9, Str20, <em>Warrior Mummy/Wraith</em><br/>\n17 PM10, <em>Spectre</em><br/>\n18 Wiz4, Great Fort<br/>\n19 Fighter5<br/>\n20 Fighter6, Improved Crit: Mercurial Longsword, Str21<br/>\n21 PM11, EWF: Mercurial<br/>\n22 PM12 <em>Vampire Rogue</em><br/>\n23 PM13, Epic ER: Acid (or Craft Wand on WoG)<br/>\n24 PM14, Epic Prowess, Int19, <em>Greater Bodak</em><br/>\n25 PM15<br/>\n26 PM16, EMA, <em>Ghoul King</em><br/>\n27 PM17, Great Str I<br/>\n28 PM18, Str23, <em>Vampire Mage</em><br/>\n29 PM19, Epic Mummy<br/>\n30 PM20, Great Str II, <em>Skeletal Blackguard</em><br/>\n31 PM21<br/>\n32 PM22, Greater Ruin, Str25, <em>Lich</em><br/>\n33 PM23, Great Str III<br/>\n34 PM24, <em>Lich Lord</em><br/>\n35 PM25, Epic Warding, 9<sup>th</sup> level spells<br/>\n36 PM26, Great Str IV, Str 28, <em>Alhoon</em><br/>\n37 PM27<br/>\n38 PM28, Hell Ball (or Dragon Knight), <em>Elder Alhoon</em><br/>\n39 PM29, Great Str V<br/>\n40 PM30, Str30, <em>Lesser Demilich</em><br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Combat Vitals</span></strong><br/>\nAB: 37/32/27<br/>\nMax Possible AB: 63/58/52/63 (with Haste)<br/>\nHP: 374 (614 with max Con)<br/>\nNaked AC: 29<br/>\nMundane Plate &amp;

Your AC is so high that you can outlast even the toughest of melee opponents, and your crit/sneak immunity renders many opponents irrelevant.\u00a0 You get tons of skill points.\u00a0 There\u2019s enough tools in his toolbox to deal with casters outright (<em>IKD, Breaches, Mords, Ruins, plenty of Summons, etc</em>).\u00a0 Perhaps some of the nuanced touches WoG has given PMs made this easier than I thought \u2013 improved undead summons, Strength of Bone, Craft Wand able to be taken by PM at PM level 8 or as a PM bonus feat.\u00a0 Lots of subtle touches that make the class enjoyable to be played.\u00a0 Mileage varies, of course, and a standard NW version would suffer one less AB (due to having to go Wiz6/Ftr4 to get Craft Wand but same net feats). This was solo-ed on the PW of World of Greyhawk.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nThere are a lot of different ways to approach a pure Palemaster, and this was my way.\u00a0 He sports a maximum Heal skill to highlight his vivisectionary background.\u00a0 Plenty of skill points here to do what you want, though.\u00a0 5 of the 6 Epic spells to play with, 9<sup>th</sup> level Wizard spells, super high AC, crit/sneak/paralysis immunity.\u00a0 Best summons in the game.\u00a0 You won\u2019t win any slaying contests, but you will outlast your opponents.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nWith mere +5 gear, Cats Grace and EMA, and an Extended Haste, AC gets to 76 with no problem.\u00a0 Attached are a few pics to demonstrate. Also added a screenie of my spell choices before I head into combat.\u00a0 Epic Warding is there as the \u201cjust in case\u201d button.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nOne of the challenges of a pure PM is determining how you are going to win battles.\u00a0 The mobs are easy enough, but boss battles tend to be tougher, higher ACs, immunities, resistances, etc., so I had to get the highest possible AB without completely gimping the character (funnily enough my character\u2019s moniker was \u201cthe Crippled, Shalazar the Crippled to be exact).\u00a0 37 AB is pretty darn good for having 30 PM levels.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/202012/10758933_0760ba804ecf8a7d0e41f634515d198b_t.png\"/><br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/202012/10758933_51b34694c62ea18269b4d0fc5d3f9541_t.png\"/><br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/202012/10758933_96586330ebe3edd96a3749b58be720fb_t.png\"/><br/>\n<br/>\nAlso attached below is a standard NW version.\u00a0 This one gets 1 lower AB and slightly lower saves, but is more or less the same (just not as good as the WoG Version). <br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>The Vivisectionist\u00a0 (Standard NW Version)</strong><br/>\nClasses: Fighter4/Wizard6/Palemaster30<br/>\nRace: Human (<em>dwarf and elf work as well</em>)<br/>\nPlayable: 1-40 (<em>but tough sledding</em>)<br/>\nAlignment: Any Non-Good<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Attributes</span></strong><br/>\nStr16 (30)<br/>\nInt18 (19)<br/>\nWis8<br/>\nDex8<br/>\nCon12<br/>\nChr8<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Level Guide</span></strong><br/>\n1 Fighter1, WF: War Axe, LoH, Exotic Weaponry<br/>\n2 Wizard1, Spell School: Illusion<br/>\n3 Wizard2, Extend Spell<br/>\n4 Wizard3, Str17<br/>\n5 Fighter2, Blindfighting<br/>\n6 Fighter3, Knockdown<br/>\n7 PM1<br/>\n8 PM2<br/>\n9 PM3, Still Spell<br/>\n10 PM4<br/>\n11 PM5, Darkvision, <em>Ghoul</em><br/>\n12 PM6, Improved KD, Str19, <em>Shadow</em><br/>\n13 PM7, <em>Ghast</em><br/>\n14 PM8, <em>Wight</em><br/>\n15 PM9, Toughness, <em>Warrior Mummy/Wraith</em><br/>\n16 PM10, Str20, <em>Spectre</em><br/>\n17 Wizard4<br/>\n18 Wizard5, Craft Wand, Improved Crit: War Axe<br/>\n19 Wizard6<br/>\n20 Fighter4, WS: War Axe, Str21 (max Discipline)<br/>\n21 PM11, EWF: War Axe<br/>\n22 PM12 <em>Vampire Rogue</em><br/>\n23 PM13, Epic ER: Acid<br/>\n24 PM14, Epic Prowess, Int19, <em>Greater Bodak</em><br/>\n25 PM15<br/>\n26 PM16, EMA, <em>Ghoul King</em><br/>\n27 PM17, Great Str I<br/>\n28 PM18, Str23, <em>Vampire Mage</em><br/>\n29 PM19, Epic Mummy<br/>\n30 PM20, Great Str II, <em>Skeletal Blackguard</em><br/>\n31 PM21<br/>\n32 PM22, Greater Ruin, Str25, <em>Lich</em><br/>\n33 PM23, Great Str III<br/>\n34 PM24, <em>Lich Lord</em><br/>\n35 PM25, Epic Warding<br/>\n36 PM26, Great Str IV, Str 28, <em>Alhoon</em><br/>\n37 PM27<br/>\n38 PM28, Hell Ball, <em>Elder Alhoon</em><br/>\n39 PM29, Great Str V<br/>\n40 PM30, Str30, <em>Lesser Demilich</em><br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Combat Vitals</span></strong><br/>\nAB: 36/31/26<br/>\nHP: 374<br/>\nNaked AC: 29<br/>\nMundane Plate &amp;

But sword and board seemed the way to go.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the discussion, and to Webshaman for inspiring me to explore this concept.</div>"

I have one other char there on Wog at Level 38 but feel i am still learning the meta there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have another build i started that i want to play ToEE since Maxmillion doesnt want to go there and its sort of similar to this Vivisectionist build PM30 wiz 3 but i wanted to go elf AA and dex based. Currently at level 6 not taken any AA yet but now i think its better i should swap AA for rogue as then i get better damage with 7 levels of rogue for more sneak attack damage and access to UMD. Can i get any advice on what would be the best feats to take for a PM30 wiz 3 rogue 7 build? I know all the rogue levels will be pre epic and so the UMD will be lower, so i wonder if taking sf umd would be worth it? I think on WoG it will maybe better than AA or Monk.<br/>\n<br/>\nI noticed that if i sneak up then i get the pet to and attack and then with bow at the back shoot them down. PM gets skills for hide and ms so its pretty good synergy with rogue as well as lots of skill points via high int.</div>"
