No messing about trying to be clever, no tricks up its sleeve. It's a straight-up grunt build designed to hit things often and hard. No bells and whistles. I have, however, tried to mitigate horrid saves with the use of CoT, and the AC isn't absolutely disastrous, which I'd feared. It's still far from stellar, but liveable with, hopefully.

If I took Fighter 8 at level 20, I could take Great Cleave then, and IKD at level 18. It would then mean delaying EWF, EWS, AS, EP, OCrit and DCrit by one level each, then taking WM from level 32 until the end. That would nett me +1 AB and IKD, at the cost of -3 to Will, -5 to Reflex and -1 to Fortitude saves. Does that sound better?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Just wish there was way to switch between using the scimmy with shield and twohanded like in later editions, and it would be really great. Good fun.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi Stag!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother build to read from the ECB, hooray!<br/>\nA great start to the day for me, not only is there a new GDL build, GDL build commentary but now Stag has created a dev critting monster for us to review.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the concept, I like the use of three classes pre-epic to maximise on saves, which CoT enhances further. I like the use of the bonus feats epic to obtain seven great strength feats. I like pumping WM levels sky high to get a very high melee AB.<br/>\nI agree the Fighter 8/WM 22 /CoT 10 split is probably better, as you gain an extra feat and +AB getting up to that magic 50 AB number, which will also help with crit threat rolls and hitting with your fourth attack, also allowing you to have expertise or power attack constantly active if desired depending on the situation.\u00a0<br/>\nOne of the challenges with WM is trying to minimise the number of epic toughness feats which I think you do well.\u00a0<br/>\nI have a tendency to take Epic Prowess and Armor Skin (if I take armor skin) pretty late in builds which probably reflects WoG influence on me, in builds such as Aielund etc taking those feats earlier as you do, is solid.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have some small comments to make which are purely minor tweaks and make little difference to the overall power in this build but I have listed them here in case you were interested<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>With two prestige classes in your build plus a whole bunch of bonus fighter/CoT feats to obtain weapon master pre-epic, you do have the option of choosing any race you wish without worrying about multiclass penalties. I guess there are a few choices depending if you want to stick with sword and shield (which is good here as some extra AC is very much desirable, also protects against knockdown and crits) or to go two handed (which is also good here for extra strength damage in case dev crit doesn't proc or is nerfed/disabled in modules)\nChoices include Gnome to wield that scimitar in two hands, for extra +1AC, extra HP (or another stat for you to choose as you wish), or Halfling for two handed scimitar usage, extra AC and +1 extra saves (at the cost of some HP).\u00a0Dwarf is another nice choice here for extra HP, and to boost saves against spells, Cha would be dropped to 6, not sure if this affects your CoT abilities, you probably will know the answer to that, also sometimes dwarf is not always the best RP wise. Elf would grant Keen Senses to make the most out of your Spot skill, one would lose a little HP which can be worked around.\nSmall races are very cute and very fun to play from an RP perspective, even if there are penalties to knockdown checks and being unable to wield large weapons. I was partying with BlackCobra in WoG the other day with a dex halfling fighter/rogue and it was super cute for a little pretty halfling lass to be tanking for a big bad tall human cleric standing at the back shooting with a crossbow. I remember Cornflower recently posting it was funny to watch a small gnome improved knockdown larger opponents with an ultra high AB score when he was playing a Fighter RDD. Mick has taught me with such small races it is important to get improved knockdown which I will need to game test one day.\nIf you want to stay human and have extra skill points you could always drop Int to 13 and put Dex to 14, to give the character some ranged AB and a little flexibility in equipping a chain shirt with an appropriate Dex bonus, also helps with the reflex save\n</details>\n\nAnyway nice one!<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally if the readers need some music whilst reading Stag's build...\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<span data-s9e-mediaembed=\"youtube\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:100%;max-width:640px\"><span style=\"display:block;overflow:hidden;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/?list=PLg6tYYDm8NjlQFe0FyHhVnit2Im-tRe_c\" style=\"background:url(https://i.ytimg.com/vi//hqdefault.jpg) 50% 50% / cover;border:0;height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;width:100%\"></iframe></span></span><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I think I'm now settled on the F8/WM22/CoT10 (I still get to keep Will saves at 20 - it's one of those landmarks for me). I have been thinking about dwarf instead of human, because, well, why wouldn't you? But it comes down to that extra feat (and the same is true of other races). So, loath or despise it, human seems optimal. I do quite like the Dex/Int changeover, though (and it would save me having to work out where to put those extra skill points - like in cross-classing Search/ OLock/ DTrap and so on). Oh, and if I'm going late-end WM, I'd go Listen rather than Spot. Personal preference.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd thanks for the vid - I remember it well!

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Man dont be so hard on yourself I've read plenty of builders make simple errors but hehe thats the purpose of peer review!<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the remaining 45 skills points I think it depends on the environment and whether you have a rogue or even a wizard in your party<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the knock spell and find traps work like in vanilla NWN, and you have items that can cast this that don't require UMD then there is no real need to invest in this, unless one gains exp from disarming traps (like in Aielund). Likewise if there are no penalties for bashing open doors or chests with power attack open lock becomes less useful, however there are modules where the contents of chests gets degraded when bashed...<br/>\n<br/>\nSearch is useful for finding hidden doors and identifying the traps in the first place. For an environment like WoG I was told by Knight of Limbo to aim for a modified search score of 10 and I've just stuck with this out of habit. It seems to work in WoG for what I need at least, although a little more search I think would be handy<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it was up to me I would probably put a few points in search to get a modified score of 10 and put some points in heal.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could also put a few more crossclassed points into spellcraft 21(23) if you wanted for better saves provided you have an item with either +int (ie fox's cunning) or +spellcraft (ie bard song) but I'm not sure that is necessarily the best choice.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The module designer makes the locks as hard as he wants.<br/>\nOpen lock is a \"take 20\" skill. If you only take <strong>one single rank</strong> (and have a dex of 13), you will be able to open locks with a DC of 22. If you use dex buffs and thieves' tools you can reach the high 30's. You have no spellcaster- or UMD class in this build, but there are still standard items that let every class use the Knock spell.<br/>\nAn alternative \"target\" for opening locks is to bash them. A large weapon with high base damage, a high strength and the Power attack feat are helpful here.\u00a0 So is also elemental weapon damage if the damage resistance of the container is high.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe target for search depends on several factors. If the trap is set by a player, the Set trap skill of that player is added to the DC, and the traps soon become impossible to detect. If you play a module, the DC of the traps may be altered by the module builder.<br/>\nBut most often you encounter standard traps with standard DCs.\u00a0<br/>\nThe Search skill is not a \"take 20\" skill, so you roll a d20 and the result may be anything from 1 to 20 (+ your skill rank). You roll once every round, twice if in active detect mode.<br/>\nThe DC of the most difficult standard deadly traps is 22. If your modified skill rank is 2, you will need to roll a 20 to detect the trap. It may take a while. If your modified rank is 21, you will always detect the trap on your first attempt, even when you roll a 1.\u00a0 So there is no need to go any higher than a modified rank of 21.<br/>\nThe DC for epic traps is 43. Only rogues can detect traps with a DC higher than 35, so you don't need to bother with this build.<br/>\n<br/>\nDisable traps is a \"take 20\" skill. If the trap is set by a player, the Set trap skill of that player is added to the DC. If you play a module, the DC of the traps may be altered by the module builder.\u00a0<br/>\nThe most difficult standard deadly traps have a disarm DC of 36. You only need a modified rank of 16 to disarm them (because of the \"take 20\"). Now only rogues can disarm traps with a DC above 35. So if you have no rogue levels and want to \"disarm\" the traps with a DC of 36, you have to recover them instead. Recover has (for some odd reason) no DC limit for non rogue characters. To be able to recover traps with a disarm DC of 36, you have to deal with a DC of 46. So you will need 26 modified ranks to recover them.<br/>\nOf course you can use a Find traps spell instead if you have it available. You can also \"disarm\" floor traps by stepping on them and hoping for a successful save, or spawning a summoned creature on them.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It's good ol' fashioned \"find trap, save, pray for a save, blow up, reload, repeat until not dead\" time again!
