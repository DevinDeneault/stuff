Note the following:<br/>\n-- You cannot create more than one<br/>\n-- It is possible to create more than one but you're basically trying to exploit<br/>\n-- If you try to get more than one, your second item will be deleted and so will your item/EX/gold (let that be a warning)<br/>\n-- You can create more than one of the three potions<br/>\n-- Each harp will give you a custom ability and a NWN cast spell<br/>\n---- The custom ability is tied to Harper scout levels and you cannot use it at all without some harper scout levels.<br/>\n---- These are meant to be additional class abilities, rather than crafted items; no different than a shifter being able to shift as a class ability<br/>\n---- Due to game limitations, this is the best way to get additional abilities in the game<br/>\n<br/>\n-Adds the following items that can be created:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Potion of Antidote (75 GP, 15 XP)<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Tallar's Harp\u00a0(REQ: 25000 gp, 2500 EXP, Mithral Bar)<br/>\n--\u00a0Custom scripted\u00a0version of Deafening Clang tied to HS levels<br/>\n-- Hold Monster<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Zunzalor's Harp\u00a0(REQ: 30000 gp, 3000 EXP, Black Rock (level 15 G Dispel) or Mord's Disj)<br/>\n--\u00a0Custom scripted\u00a0version of Wounding Whispers* tied to HS levels<br/>\n-- Greater Dispel<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Janthra's Harp\u00a0(REQ: 12000 gp, 1200 EXP, Adamantine bar)<br/>\n--\u00a0Custom scripted\u00a0version of Stoneskin tied to HS levels<br/>\n-- Invs sphere<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Methid's Harp\u00a0(REQ: 8000 gp, 800 EXP, Ironwood Planks)<br/>\n--\u00a0Custom scripted\u00a0version of Freedom tied to HS levels<br/>\n-- Knock<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Jhannyl Wristlet\u00a0(REQ: 20000 gp, 2000 EXP, Silver bar)<br/>\n-- +2 AC (armour)<br/>\n-- +2 Saves<br/>\n-- Healing circle 2/d<br/>\n-- Restoration 1/d<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n* One note about wounding whispers. The NWN version is bugged to always do the same amount of damage but it has been fixed to do random here (the spell will be updated as well). You will currently not do damage to someone unless they take HP away, so if you've got stoneskin and wounding whispers up and are taking no damage, wounding whispers will not damage your attacker. This is intended.<br/>\n<br/>\nChampion of Torm PrC Updates<br/>\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlignment\u00a0<br/>\n-Alignment restrictions are removed<br/>\n<br/>\nDivine Wrath<br/>\n-Duration changed to CHA Mod + CoT Level<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
