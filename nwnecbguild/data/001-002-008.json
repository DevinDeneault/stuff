I'm looking for this:<br/>\n- No hardcore rest restrictions.<br/>\n- No permadeath or \"10 deaths and you're permadead\" or other silly death penalties that takes 15 minutes just to read through.<br/>\n- Some way to avoid PvP if you don't want to.<br/>\n- Some players to RP with if I feel like it.<br/>\n- Allows multiclassing without too many restrictions.<br/>\n- Cool items.<br/>\n- Possible to quest/level up alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, any suggestions?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It is a mid magic place, deemed a challenge by many. It does have some restrictions on resting, you can't do it every where, but you can do it most places out doors, once every 16 minutes of real life, if you have a bedroll , or I believe 32 minutes otherwise. Many dungeons /caves/etc also have a place where it is safe enough to bed down in.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a discussion on that place active now. <br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my SM-N900P using Tapatalk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit...

It seems to be very hard to solo, though.\n</div></blockquote>\n\nI started playing WoG I think about 2 weeks ago. I've been playing solo. Got to level 21 on Druid which is probably one of the most favourable classes to play on the PW (maybe Cleric is stronger?). Its definitely a challenging module. Expect to learn how to run, expect to die a few times etc.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nMonsters do have a very good chance of killing you, they often use stealth (meaning spot and listen are USEFUL, like i mean in the OC I just sold that Watchman's helm in WoG I equip it most of the time!), ranged weapons if they cant reach you, will use dispel magic against any buffs you have (High caster levels are useful to counter this!). Some of the archers will run away from you if you are getting close to them in melee, and shoot poisoned arrows (ie strength damage etc) too! This PW means business :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is always fun for me (I was playing through NWN Bioware OC/SOU/HOTU and Aielund and got totally bored with point and click after a while without having to ever use consumables). I find it forces me to use all the tools available in the game, which is what I like.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd suggest a few threads to read if you do want to play WoG which helped me!<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/worldofgreyhawkfr/playing-better-t2946.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/worldof ... t2946.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/playing-better-the-importance-of-knowledge-and-int-t2354384.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">playing-better-the-importance-of-knowle ... 54384.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nProbably the most useful strategy is 'Pull and slay, or run away'! (I was taught this rhyming phrase from another experienced WoG player).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich basically means get small amounts of enemies to come to you with a ranged weapon + retreating, and see if you can deal with them via your usual means. If you can't RUN away :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some small changes to spells and feats which are listed on the website here:\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf all else fails and you are really struggling the WoG players on the forum have been fantastic. They have been very welcoming of new players and have helped me settle in and adjust to the PW to the extent I really enjoy playing it.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm happy to help too if you need it, although others are far more experienced at the PW than I am :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Edit: </strong>by the way dont get too stressed RE Solo. With solo play I found being a few levels above what is needed to play the area in a party a useful guide. Dying is only 50 exp / level at the moment, and 10% gold, so it is not excessively punishing if you dont carry a lot of gold<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You are right in that it is hard to solo WoG and the amount of detail required in my post has probably suggested that is the case. It may not be the right PW unless you like a challenge (which I love! LOL). The only other PWs I have tried is Arelith and I think Nordock (I will have to check, I am not 100%).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: You might enjoy this thread LOL (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/forums/neverwinter-nights-1/players-corner-nwn1/top-persistent-worlds-nwn1\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://neverwintervault.org/forums/nev ... orlds-nwn1</a>)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It's a bit restricted for me, for instance, you can't run from point A to point B, it's considered bad RP. Go figure.... I've been a DM on pen and paper for more years than most of you been alive, as well as build two PW:s myself. I think someone is confusing ease of play with bad RP... When you play on PnP, you don't sit around the table waiting 2 months to play because it would take your characters that long time to travel across the lands. That's just plain silly.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
