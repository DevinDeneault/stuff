      "content": "<div>...is what I'm currently in, so I come to the Guild for some guidance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI confess, this started out as a name that simply came to me while I was writing something else. And that name was Tulip Brickhead. And he was a Dwarf. So I had a mull as to what sort of character he might be, and figured him a gentle but stubborn soul. Thus, an ideal party tank. Not interested in inflicting great swathes of damage and mayhem, but absolutely determined to protect his friends from harm. He has no arcane or divine assistance, just the strength of his heart (after all, this is me asking, after all <span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83d\ude07</span>).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I went into a Dex-based Dwarven Defender with EDRIII. The best I came up with was a Fighter 16/ DwD 19/ Harper Scout 5. He ended up with 21/- DR, 658 hit points, and an AC of 29 naked or in full plate, 32 with tower shield (he's not an idiot: he's not looking to get hit). He has an AB of 43 with his finessed hatchet (40 ranged), and all his saves are over 20 (but under 30). He also has 10 uses of Defensive Stance a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of which seemed alright. Not brilliant, but alright. And then I wondered...How about an EDRIII DwD with Epic Dodge? And that's where my quandary began.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best I've managed to date is a Fighter 8/ Rogue 14/ DwD 18. On the plus side, it gains 51 skill points and ED. On the minus side it loses 3 AB, 2 AC (robes) or 1 (full plate), and 1 Defensive Stance. It also means either ED or EDRIII come very late in the build.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you offer any assistance, please? Don't get me wrong, I'm not asking for a full build from you good people, just some thoughts on how I might improve things. Or, indeed, whether the whole EDRIII and ED idea is a dumb one (in a purely mundane build, ofc).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Oh, btw, this doesn't mean I've forgotten about Viconia, but this one just became something of a brain-itch.</div>",

I would indeed like a late Tumble dump, but 11 SD means I could go for 19 DwD and 10 Fighter, thereby having another bonus feat to replace the feat I'd need to use for Mobility. As you rightly surmise, a stealthy tank isn't what I'm looking for - something of a self-contradiction when you're trying to pull enemies to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know Rogue brings lots of other goodies, but I'm going for something simple here, so it might just obfuscate matters (sometimes simple is hard work!). I'll go sharpen my pencil!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

I suspect that Brickhead came from a nickname we gave to our rugby team's hooker (no, not that sort), whose head did look like an upended brick. I was his loose-head prop, with the nickname of Donkey, which was fine by me! Even though it actually meant it was me did all the donkey-work while others got the glory. Anyway, I digress...<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been looking at incorporating SD instead of Rogue, and it's not actually making things much better. Don't get me wrong, I'm not dismissing it, I just think maybe I need to do things differently in order to best make use of the class. I confess, I do like the idea of a Tunnelrunner barreling down those deep paths until nasties appear, then standing stock still and drawing in his brows...</div>",

      "content": "<div>Interesting character concept, Stag!<br/>\nThe name gives me completely different associations though. <br/>\nTulip Brickhead is a female gnome. <br/>\nShe is of the renown Brickhead clan, known for their quality stoneskin spells. <br/>\nShe is a jester. Her parents believed that they were gong to have a boy and wanted to call him Turnip. But she fooled them, being a girl and everything. So Turnip was hastily changed to Tulip. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for alignment she is chaotic good, a free spirit, not tied down by tradition. But she knows the family secret and can do stoneskin quite well.<br/>\nThat brings us to the question of class. \u00a0Maybe my mind is playing tricks on me, or perhaps she is, but I see her as a rogue. She has a bit of wizard from her family background. She may well be a jester, but not in the sense of being an artist, but even so, she is not without some charm. <br/>\nSo here we almost have a MAD build with dexterity, intelligence and charisma. Lucky she gets some constitution for free.<br/>\nED should be within reach, but she will never be a DC caster and probably never reaches any degree of indispellability. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo there is my go at Tulip. Not at all what you had in mind, alas.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow as to your project. Simple is work, I couldn't agree more.<br/>\nSometimes that work is just throwing out the things on your whish list that you really don't need.<br/>\nUnless you find a synergy, most things you add to a build come at a cost. <br/>\nEDR III and ED is possible in a dwd build with a given class combo. But you are getting close to a MAD build, even if you say he is a dexer to begin with. MAD builds are much more easy with RDD, but then we talk strength builds. With dex builds you have the option to take a class that offers great dex as an epic bonus feat to boost dexterity. But none of those classes help qualify for ED other than to have tumble as a class skill.<br/>\nSorry, but life is a b****sometimes.</div>",

I guess that's due to having to spread oneself too thin in order to get too much in, thereby diluting the whole (as Mick hints at) - both in terms of the number of levels one has to invest in a class in order to make use of just one feat, and the stat spread.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the itch has been scratched for now.
