      "content": "<div>I want a melee build meant for PvM. I just came from an adventure session with a GS WM that just cut his way through everything with a few wizard's buffs and I salivated. I thought about asking for a WM initially, but then I realized that there might be other melee secrets other than the weapon master, so it's free discussion. I do not want a sneak, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is for Arelith, and I figure that by now most people know the limitations: if you multiclass, you must take three consecutive levels before taking any other class. There is no devastating critical. Low magic, without being able to enchant the same weapon (for instance, you can't do GMW and Flame Weapon on the same sword.) At level 30 you can mostly strive for items of +1 STR and +1 CON (or any other items), and a sword of +3 AB, +6 Slashing, +4 Energy damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as I understand Shields aren't too worthwhile in PvM when with a grouo of people, but I'll leave that for the builders to decide too.</div>"

Of course if the AB-AC of your enemies (their AB vs your AC that is) is 28+ then it makes no difference since they would miss you only on a 1 shield or not. That is not usually the case (but I don't know about Arelith) hence +8 AC will, in all likelihood, make you to be hit a lot less often.<br/>\n<br/>\nFYI the guy has 30 mundane AC. With a buffing cleric with travel and plant domains (or anyhow access to cleric buffs+barkskin+haste/mass haste) that figure becomes 54, to which you can add +1 from mage armor, +5 from a bard song and +3 from dodge boots (you said you can get +3 gear right?) going up to 63. Consider that you have +1 AC vs the current target and +4 AC vs all attacks of opportunity too. You also can use expertise for a further +5 AC. So we are looking potentially at 68 AC which can further be capped by stacking MA with the shadow MA up to the dodge cap (another +7 dodge AC).</div>"

Bard/Ftr/RDD builds can be effective in as few as 20 levels (there are a number of examples in the Level 20 forum) because the power curve kicks in much sooner.</div>"

Otherwise, no.<br/>\n<br/>\n3- You get a bonus feat at WM 13 and another one at WM 16, but I wouldn't underestimate 2 AB. If you're worried about heavy investments, don't go for WM, but you already got SO MUCH IN, all those feats, 4 skill ranks in intimidate, to get only 7 levels. Might as well make use of that class to raise your AB, since the ONLY REASON you'd want more feats is because you're spending so many of them in WM requirements.<br/>\n<br/>\n4- No. It's not worth it to dual wield Scimitars and Rapiers because they're medium weapons, which means you receive a -4 penalty to all attacks and that's not good.<br/>\n<br/>\n5- Depends on servers. I find that it's good in places where you can buy very expensive items (like a bow that costs 900.000 GPs), cuz it makes stuff that you sell give more gold.</div>"

Bard instead has classed taunt and spellcraft and a weak bardsong (at 6th lvl +1 AB, +2 dmg, +1 saves and +1 skills). Spellcraft and taunt ain't bad at all, but whether it's worthwhile or not depends on the player's preference.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>2. The scimitar + towershield for good AC and frequent crits is very appealing. Does it matter whether I choose Rapier or Scimitar? And is there another one handed weapon that's better yet for a WM?</div></blockquote>Environment dependent. Scimmy and rapier, as said, differ in damage type and scimmy is keenable. Which one is best for you depends on what's exactly available where you play.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>3. As far as I understand, the 16 WM is just for +2 AB to the favored weapon.</div></blockquote>And two feats. Also, +2 AB is no \"just\"; it i spretty meaningful and alters significantly the dmg output per round.<br/>\n<blockquote><div> Correct me if I'm wrong, but from 7 WM to 16 WM, the only difference is +2 AB. That seems a lot for 9 levels. Shouldn't I put them in Fighter for more feats?</div></blockquote>Do you need more feats? (at most you get +2 feats btw) More than you need +2 AB (equivalent to a further EWF)?<br/>\n<blockquote><div>4. Versatility in weaponry: is it recommended to take an additional Favored Weapon in some two-handed weapon for more damage</div></blockquote>40 lvls and Arelith leveling rules leave little space for that route which wants feats; you'd probably be forced to  indeed stop at WM 7 in that case. A second WoC could be heavy flail, because it's 2-handed blunt damage.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>or maybe go for improved two weapon fighting and wield two scimitars/rapiers with every second hit a critical?</div></blockquote>Bad idea, although if you wanna do that for style points (which is entirely subjective and too much affected by a certain drow character I'd say) a high AB like that granted by heavy WM helps (since you get a further -2 AB compared to \"proper\" dual wielding, because of the non small size of the offhand weapon).<br/>\n<blockquote><div>5. Is Appraise any good?</div></blockquote>Module dependent, is it any good on Arelith?</div>"
