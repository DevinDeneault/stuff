      "content": "<div>Hello elite NWN character builders,\u00a0<br/>\nI'm a big fan of the Baldur's Gate series. Now that the Enhanced Edition of NWN came out, I thought I'd give it a try. In BG I really enjoyed playing as a blade. I like being able to buff up to near invincibility and then deal out heaps and heaps of damage very quickly. I also like to double wield, just because it's cool. Now I've read a little about character creation in NWN and I feel attracted to a Bard 16/Fighter 14/RDD 10 Build. I plan to use it just for the official campaign (OC, SoU, HotU), so I think I will only be able to get it to about level 30 max in this setting. Racewise I prefer human or half-elf. Alignment-wise I usually enjoy playing good guys (not lawful but rather chaotic).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow my questions:\u00a0\n<ul>\n<li>For the starting stats I see a lot of builds sacrificing dexterity or constitution to get lots of STR. Is it worth it? Wouldn't I get more stat points overall if I start fairly leveled (Like everything 14, except Wisdom 8)</li>\n<li>Are there any items that make up weak stats in the OC/Expansions? Like the Dexterity-Gloves in BG?</li>\n<li>Is dual wielding worth the costs? How do I get the most damage per round: double Scimitars or should I rather go for a 2-handed weapon like a greatsword or a scythe?\u00a0</li>\n<li>I like being able to cast some spells as it makes the character more versatile and fun. I don't mind taking off armor before big fights. How much spellcasting makes sense in a build like this? What are especially good spells? In BG I mostly used spells for buffing, but some AoE debuffing or damage spells are also nice. You could even get to cast Time Stops regularly with a simulacrum using a scroll. Are there similar tricks in NWN?</li>\n<li>I'm not a big fan of ranged attacks. I find it more fun to be able to get close to the enemy and hurt with lots of damage quickly. Are there good items that enhance speed in the OC and expansions? Like the boots of speed in BG.</li>\n</ul>\n\nI'm sure I'm there have to be some builds here that would fit my profile. I have been trying to find them but get overwhelmed by the possibilities. As a newbie I find it hard to weigh pros and cons of the different builds.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI liked some aspects of these builds:\u00a0<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/groups/NWN-Players/discussions/1/2789318172125666238/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://steamcommunity.com/groups/NWN-P ... 125666238/</a>\u00a0<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build195827.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/buil ... 95827.html</a><br/>\nDraconic Swordsman v.1/v.2<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of them have low Dex and would not work with dual wielding. Others sacrifice CHA for STR and end up with little or no spells, so none of them are a perfect fit. Any ideas?\u00a0</div>"

When I first came here some 5.5 years ago I came from Baldur's Gate looking for a similar build as you. I got an absolute beauty from the combined talents of Empyre and Valerfor. Rather than simply re-hash what was written then - which also covers some of the other questions you raise - I'll just link you to it. It's a long thread, but page 1 should cover most of what you're looking for. <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/non-shooty-non-magicky-elves-you-know-you-re-out-t-t2354345.html#.VuMvM0DOEqg\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Non-shooty non-magicky</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHope it's of some use.

      "content": "<div>On the Tendorizing Tenor build, I have great respect for the principles...however, there are issues. No Blind Fighting, Knockdown/IKD not taken until epic levels (same for Curse Song in the initial build). There is a way to get them in pre-epic, and that is to only use one weapon type. Not only does that give you all 3 feats pre-epic (as well as Curse Song if you follow the second levelling guide) - replacing a Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization, and Improved Critical in the other weapon - it also frees up EWF, EWS, OC, and DC in the second weapon in epic levels, meaning you can take a further 4 Great Strengths, thereby improving both your AB and damage by 2.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does, of course, have a downside - and that is losing one damage type, either slashing or bludgeoning, so any enemy with a resistance to one type or the other will be harder to handle (for example, Undead and Constructs are more vulnerable to bludgeoning damage and have a resistance to slashing/piercing).<br/>\n<br/>\nOn balance, I think the benefits of taking only one weapon type outweigh its downside. However, I wouldn't go for scimitar, because it's a medium-sized weapon, and dual-wielding them gives you a -4 AB on each hand, rather than the -2 dual-wielding with a small or tiny weapon gives you. The smart choice would be short-swords, but there is a case for handaxes. Another alternative would be to sacrifice Improved KD, take Exotic Weapon Proficiency, then focus in kukris.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my thoughts!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

If you want to take advantage of the full level 40 build, you might want to look at some modules that enable that. Mines of Twin Summit will take you forward from the end of the OC up to level 40. Sands of Fate will get you there from the end of HotU. Both of these sets of modules (and access to them) can be found in our Modules forum, if you're interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

I could not take lasting inspiration because I only take 16 bard levels. With the pre-epic feats I take at epic levels: I think it's just Still Spell and Lingering Song. I could take two Great Strengths instead, but I think being able to cast war cry and have longer song effects are more beneficial overall. The spell capabilities go up pretty late anyway, so it would not make sense to take it earlier.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the Singing Spell-slinging Shortsworddrake (V. 0.1):\u00a0<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>\n\n\nDEX: 14 (15)\nWIS: 8\nCHA: 14 (16)\nHuman: (Quick to Master)\n02: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus: Shortsword\n04: Fighter(2): DEX+1, Knockdown, (DEX=15)\n06: Fighter(3): Cleave\n08: Bard(5): STR+1, (STR=15)\n10: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Shortsword\n12: Fighter(6): STR+1, Improved Critical: Shortsword, Improved Knockdown, (STR=16)\n14: Red Dragon Disciple(2): (STR=18)\n16: Red Dragon Disciple(4): STR+1, (STR=21)\n18: Red Dragon Disciple(6): Two-Weapon Fighting\n20: Red Dragon Disciple(8): STR+1, (STR=22)\n22: Red Dragon Disciple(10): {Darkvision}, (STR=26), (CHA=16)\n24: Bard(8): STR+1, Lingering Song, (STR=27)\n26: Fighter(8): Great Cleave\n28: Fighter(10): STR+1, Devastating Critical: Shortsword, (STR=28)\n30: Fighter(12): Epic Weapon Focus: Shortsword, Epic Weapon Specialization: Shortsword\n32: Bard(9): STR+1, (STR=29)\n34: Bard(11)\n36: Bard(13): STR+1, Epic Prowess, (STR=30)\n38: Bard(15)\n40: Bard(16): STR+1, (STR=32)\nHitpoints: 440\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 27/23/22\nBAB: 26\nAC (naked/mundane items only): 26/36\nAlignment Changes: 0\nDiscipline 43(54), Lore 8(27), Perform 31(34), Persuade 35(38), Pick Pocket 10(12), Spellcraft 42(45), Taunt 42(45), Tumble 41(43), UMD 20(23)\n\n02: Discipline(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n04: Discipline(1),\u00a0\n06: Discipline(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n08: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(3), UMD(1),\u00a0\n10: Discipline(1), Save(3),\u00a0\n12: Discipline(1), Save(11),\u00a0\n14: Discipline(1), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(3),\u00a0\n16: Discipline(1), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(7),\u00a0\n18: Discipline(1), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(11),\u00a0\n20: Discipline(1), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(15),\u00a0\n22: Discipline(1), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(20),\u00a0\n24: Discipline(1), Perform(3), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), UMD(3),\u00a0\n26: Discipline(1),\u00a0\n28: Discipline(1),\u00a0\n30: Discipline(1), Save(10),\u00a0\n32: Discipline(1), Perform(3), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(7), Taunt(8), Tumble(8),\u00a0\n34: Discipline(1), Perform(2), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1),\u00a0\n36: Discipline(1), Perform(1), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1),\u00a0\n38: Discipline(1), Perform(1), Persuade(1), Pick Pocket(2), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1),\u00a0\n40: Discipline(1), Perform(1), Persuade(1), Pick Pocket(7), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1),\u00a0\n</details></div>"

If I take Bard 4/Fighter 12/RDD 4 pre-Epic I can get more feats pre-epic and basically be two-weapon-fighting by level 20. BAB goes up from 26 to 28, along with AB by two points to 43. Sadly it means I'll only be able to do the more bardy stuff quite late in the game. I lose 4 Skill points, but that doesn't seem too much. The saves are slightly worse, too. What level progression would you recommend to balance the build?\u00a0</div>"
