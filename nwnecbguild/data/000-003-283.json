But as i remember for that shield you want, you need 37 STR natural, right? If so, then it is impossible to achieve that within 40 levels, no matter what.<br/>\n<br/>\n An Elven Bard 16/ RDD 14/ SD 10 can come close to that but no way you can have both natural STR 37/ DEX 25 with any kind of build.<br/>\n<br/>\n I think, the best you can do is come to a natural STR 34/ DEX 25 with this build and that is by devoting almost all of your Epic Feats to ability increases and starting with STR 16/ DEX 19 with an Elf.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Your AB will be something like 39 even without it , cause RDD is OP as hell.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, hope you enjoy it<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
