      "content": "<div>Hi guys, awesome work you guys are doing.  I've just started playing NWN again on my localish PW over here in Aus.  It's a modified Drow Wars environment that's had quite a bit of customization, now called Ancient Lands of Edon.  It's a RP environment with items up to +7, I'd say it would be a mid-high magic environment.  Some of the classes have been modified (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://aloe.wikia.com/wiki/Character_Classes\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://aloe.wikia.com/wiki/Character_Classes</a>) with new classes added as well. There is a lot of crit immunity, never really liked the idea of Dev Crit anyway.  It's a full PVP server with no PvP unless consensual  so this would be a pure PvM build.  The max level is 50 I believe, with the levels past 40 being \"Mythic Levels\" which aren't gained by xp, I'm really only looking for a build up to 40 though.<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeally I'd like an AA build with Pale Master (always wanted a Chaotic Evil, undead archer owning face ) although the build doesn't necessarily need Pale Master (I can get by without being undead), I would like him to be evil *grin*<br/>\n<br/>\nI liked the idea of this build (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build222231.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 22231.html</a>), however it's illegal with the modifications to Palemaster requiring 5 arcane levels instead of 3.  I'm a pretty big noob to pen and paper and NWN, so forgive me please, what I could tell though is if I took an extra bard level and dropped an PM level, I'd loose atleast 1 BAB, 2AC, 1 fort, 1 reflex and maybe some other stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm really open to anything, this will be my first archer class which will do some solo but I'm going to try run him with a tank as much as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks guys, and keep up the good work.<br/>\n<br/>\nPS.  This shouldn't really effect the build I don't think, but this is a list of modified feats in Edon <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://aloe.wikia.com/wiki/Modified_Feats\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://aloe.wikia.com/wiki/Modified_Feats</a><br/>\nPPS. This is a list of new feats added, most being mythic feats which can be ignored <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://aloe.wikia.com/wiki/Feats_for_Characters\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://aloe.wikia.com/wiki/Feats_for_Characters</a></div>"

      "content": "<div>Well, I honestly don't have time to look into the specifics of classes or anything for your PW, but I can tell you that you could use a more bard-heavy approach in order to achieve maximum possible offensive benefit with this class combo. You'd give up much in defense, but seriously, you're an archer, why would you care about defense when they're miles away?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first spread that comes to mind is Bard 16 (for a good Bard Song effect), AA 14 (for one extra feat and some pre-epic BAB), and PM 10 (for critical hit immunity). You could go Bard 12 AA 8 pre-epic, getting a 27 BAB and full attack schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me try to cough up something real quick.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

Naturally, it doesn't provide the PM crit immunity, but TBH, PM 10 drastically nerfs an AA's damage potential (each 2 AA levels is +1 damage, 1AB and DR penetration), enough to consider playing more as an archer and less as a solo tank.

You've got the proficiency via elf already and you're taking finesse pre-epic, so that infers that you expect to be forced into melee situations enough to spend a feat towards that eventuality.  The -1AB range will be worth the +3AB melee IMO.  It will turn that pedestrian melee AB (I always aim for a minimum of 40 unbuffed attack for any level 40 toon... if possible)  into a level that will actually hit enemies regularly.  With ED in place, that -1 DEX AC and lost reflex shouldn't be very noticeable either.</div>"

All you'll lose is a percentage of crits but the AB boost still helps. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne issue with a rogue wiz AA melee switch is that none of it's classes (or race) provide shield proficiency... so you are essentially depending on your ED to equalize the attack potential rather than max AC.  Squeezing in another feat would be difficult though, so Bard may be a better-suited melee switch tertiary and just \"eat\" the XP penalty or go half-elf (not recommended).  Just wondering if you were planning on any sneaking seeing as how the stealth skills have been ignored completely?  Without a shield, I'd expect PBS to be more effective than the switch since they are both piercing damage and you can issue SAs with a bow just as well as with a melee weapon with the AC the same.  Also, the bow is less likely being disarmed than the shortie.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough it's now water-over-the-dam at this point in your current plan, as far as using the Enserric weapons for upgrading, the disadvantage is...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSpoiler<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t[+]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThe talking property counts as a enhancement at Rizolvir's so it deprives your improvements of the max upgrades, 8 in total.   <br/>\n<br/>\nVampiric regen is indeed nice to have but HP regen is available for some compensation w/o needing to score a hit to take effect.  Similarly, it's best to wait until all preferred upgrades have been purchased before the Black Pearl OnHit upgrade is applied, which also counts toward the ceiling and causes Rizolvir to refuse max upgrade accommodations. (BTW, the way the ceiling check is set up, it's better to get the full +10 attack enhancement before all the others so it only counts as a single one.  If you take all the other upgrades and less than +10, when you return to build up to +10, it considers the weapon to already have 8 enhancements and refuses.  Doh!)  I've found that it is better to upgrade a basic +3 or better weapon at his shop to assure that all the upgrades you want will \"fit\".  The expense difference to begin upgrading with less than a +5 weapon is negligible in the loot-glutted HotU.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Off-topic, but I'd be interested to know if Enserric convos still trigger when you play Sands of Fate.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother viable approach would be to ignore finessing any weapon altogether, building essentially a pure archer, take Dodge pre-epic instead for the added AC (or Iron Will or Great Fort to boost a save weakness).  With efficiency using Called Shots and sufficient trap skills, this toon should have no problem controlling any situation except against True Seers which are more difficult to kite.  Again, the comments are in given in retrospect, but still are valid for any future ventures.   The over-powered Disable Trap and Open Lock skill levels chosen are, I assume, a function of the next series of modules that you intend to play?  For most environments, it is usually better to shuffle enough skill points into Set Trap to set deadly and epic traps, if they exist in that arena, and if you intend to manage trap fields for your archer.\n<blockquote><div>BTW, the lost DEX will effect melee AB, too, for a net gain of only +2 AB Melee.</div></blockquote>My bad.  Good catch!</div>"
