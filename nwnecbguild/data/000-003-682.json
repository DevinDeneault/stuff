      "content": "<div>Why can't i find many builds around that use these class combinations together?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe closest build that i liked in this range is one from Max: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build316785.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 16785.html</a> or <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build249806.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 49806.html</a> . Though by taking rogue you gain sneak attacks / UMD (aka impr invis, see last note down here) while you loose epic dodge / HiPS (from what i can tell on first sight).<br/>\n<br/>\nNotes:<br/>\n-This is a concept, so it's not optimized for levels / feats chosen on each level. <br/>\n-I don't like it that i took impr crit kama for a epic feat.<br/>\n-26 cleric, 3 rogue, 6 monk seems a nice way to start from leaving 5 levels open for suggestions (i took 2 rogue, 3 cleric here)<br/>\n-War domain seems really nice for DP and since i'm playing on the WoG server i need to pick either destruction or good with it.

The same exact damage as a single Kama.  Your attack progression is not any different. The only bonus to going unarmed vs using a Kama are the unarmed specific gloves. However, in a mid to low magic world, GMW and Darkfire will be as good, if not better than those gloves without taking a glove slot.  You cannot use GMW or Darkfire on unarmed because you do not have a weapon to cast them on.  I cannot think of a Cleric/monk build that would be better off with unarmed strike.. but I might be missing something.  Max's Shadow Priest, however, is definitely, without question, better with a single kama.<br/>\n<br/>\nI briefly looked at your third build.  There are probably other things I'm not noticing.. but the first thing that comes to mind is that I think you wait too long for Weapon Finesse.  I wouldn't want to wait 6 levels trying to hit monsters with my gimped str fueled AB.  You can put off Extend Spell until Cleric 6.  You aren't losing much, if any, versatility before that.  You don't have spell slots or even spell levels to use extend until you get more Cleric levels anyway.</div>"

I'm concocting one of these, as well as a Cleric 26 Rogue 13 Monk 1 like yours here, but I've had very little time to dedicate to building, as you need a fresh head to work on this and I'm always so tired from working 6 days a week 12 hours a day.

I think he even alluded to the fact that he played on WoG, so that was actually my fault.  I tend to look at these builds (except Aerlith specific ones) from the eye of a generalist.  As for TWF, I was specifically referring only to Unarmed Strike vs Single Kama wielding.  As a Cleric/Monk, you'd never (well, almost never) wear a shield anyway.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy point still stands with taking Weapon Finesse earlier though.</div>"

The extra attacks let you deal more damage per round as a direct effect of having them. KD needs to be landed and the opposing check won. IC works for multipliable damage only, of course. One nice option is to go halfling and single wield a kama. The +2 AB offsets the loss of extra attacks nicely and you get to select 2 more feats (since the human bonus feat is lost).<br/>\n<blockquote><div>Trickery + war is not possible on the WoG server (sadly...)</div></blockquote>You are mistaken: Erythnul.

I'm not a fan of toughness, but anything under 300HP as a melee character is playing with fire.  I prefer Scribe Scroll to Craft wand, but both are definitely useful.  I think overall, I like Toughness + Scribe scroll (in this build) over empower spell + IC: Kama.  Empowered Spell gives you a little more Spell book management, but it's not that hard to manage your spellbook without it.  From my understanding of WoG, you shouldn't need Emp. Spell to cap attributes. <br/>\n<blockquote><div>I wonder if ambi/2wf/i2wf is worth the loss of kd/impr kd/impr crit (since kd generates sneak attacks)?</div></blockquote>\n\nKail answered it perfectly, but it really is a play style choice.

But I will cap DEX for sure, so you can count in +12 from enhancements.

You need to know how traps work in order to look at these builds with a critical eye, lest you fall under the very wrong impression that these great builders didn't know what they were doing. LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nGeneral rule is, if your server has epic traps and you have enough skill points, go for them. If not, then you need to pick how far you wanna go:<br/>\n<br/>\n15 RANKS in Set Traps will allow you to set all deadly traps except two, can't remember which ones. You can have 13 RANKS if you have more than 5 RANKS in Disable traps because of the synergy bonus.<br/>\n<br/>\n25 RANKS of Set Traps (23 if you have Disable Traps synergy bonus) will allow you to set all Deadly traps, and 45 (43 with bonus) Modified Ranks will allow you to set Epic ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in order to set them, you need to be able to get them, so it's not just Set Traps you need to worry about. Disable Traps also needs to be taken heavily so you can recover the traps and use them yourself, and Search so you can find them in the first place, so it's a heavy skill point investment. If you don't have the skill points, you need to make cuts and let go of epic traps, then the two deadly ones with the higher DCs and then if you still can't afford them, just drop the skill altogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, one thing I don't understand: Why do you want stealth skills? You have Invisibility and no HiPS, so WHY ON EARTH would you waste 84 Skill points on Hide and Move Silently? If you want stealth, go for my Shadow Priest build, as it has HiPS to hide in combat, otherwise stealth will only be useful to approach enemies, which invisibility also does.</div>"

Disable can be a single rank if skillpoints are low so that one can recover his own traps. Trap skills work with modified ranks of course, hence one can easily count on gear (dex/int gear and skill gear) to cut down on invested points.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:85%;line-height:normal\">Edit: fixed erroneous disable trap info.</span></div>"

It also doesn't use up a spellslot/wand charge/scroll/potion each time you activate it, which you have to do if you attack and then want to \"hide\". That said, a wand of invisibility together with a magic electrifier and abundant loot can substitute efficiently enough stealth, but not completely.</div>"

I remember high DCs of about 55. Careful that there are some doors (at least there were) which require a special lockpick that gives you +100 OL and whose DC is artificially raised of 100 points; on those you can't use the +10 lockpicks, but they should be within reach anyhow.

You then can use two rings of clear thought +5 and a potion/spell of fox cunning to get to 46.

You can still adventure at 40th lvl mind me, but the best part of WoG is getting there and hence giving up playability for the sake of lvl 40 power is not really the most proper way to go, WoG wise, IMO. Exalted Sorceress or Zelle's Nature Faces or FTR 11/WM 28/Rogue 1 kind of builds (to take the concept to the extreme) are not the best choice for WoG. Anyhow, build as it feels right for you, once you are aware of the consequences</div>"

You'd lose 1 Wisdom, which with capped +12 wisdom from equipment, which Max says is fairly easy on WoG, you'll lose 1 level 3 spell, and 1 level 7 spell.  You'll also lose 1 point of AC, and 1 off your will save.  Your spells would also be cast with 2 less caster levels. It would be up to you whether that was significant or not. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis will be balanced by having 8d6 sneak attack vs 7d6 sneak attack, 12 more skill points, and a much earlier Epic Dodge.  You will not still not be able to be dispelled by anything less than a MD.  The 1d6 of extra SA isn't minor as you should have at least 3 attacks during your first flurry and up to 4 attacks with DP, Flurry of blows, and Haste.  All attacks in a flurry have SA damage added to them if SA goes off. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sure there are some other negatives to losing 2 levels of cleric besides what I listed, but I can't think of anything else.  In my mind, the tradeoff is not that extreme and might almost be a wash, if not slightly on the side of Rogue 15, depending on playstyle.</div>"

If losing ED made the build unplayable, then no, it wouldn't be, but I consider whether or not I will have the feat by level 40 and if I can endure some sacrifice to make it more powerful, then yeah, definitely it is worth it, but only if you plan on playing the toon after lvl 40, which I do. I have plenty of such builds, if you look at all my builds, and so far none have been unplayable, sometimes not even remotely hard to play. I enjoy the \"yearning\" for a feat during the leveling process, it's what keeps me going. But I understand why you don't think it's worth it.

I might consider waiting on Monk till level 30 to avoid so many levels with an XP penalty, but if, as Kail said, XP penalty isn't that big a deal on WoG, then as you have it is fine.  Once you get 25 Dex and ED, I would pump Wisdom to 19 as fast as possible. Wait until level 40 to add Dex +1 and take a Great Wisdom at level 40 as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>foojin wrote:</strong>-11 skillpoints leftover, i can avoid a +10 set trap ring with that if i want or invest them in another skill maybe? I could even give up 2 points in hide/ms for +13 so i can put disable trap higher enough that i won't need trickery domain power to disable epic traps. Suggestions ?</div></blockquote>\n\nPersonally, I'd put the skill into Search so that you aren't having to wait on a 20 roll to find Epic Traps.  The alternative of pumping 13 more skill into disable trap is good too, but I think I prefer using Divine Trickery to make up that difference to waiting for a 5% chance to find the Epic Traps.<br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>foojin wrote:</strong>-will this be more powerful at 40 and playable during the leveling time ?</div></blockquote>\n\nMax may still prefer his Cleric 26/Rogue 13 version for max level 40 power, but you aren't giving up that much power for a lot of playability.  I also think that Crippling strike, more skill points, and 1d6 of extra SA is more powerful than 1 Lvl 3 spell, 1 Lvl 7 spell (with capped Wis), 1 AC, and 1 will.  So maybe Max will even agree that this is a good balance between level 40 power and playability throughout. The dispellabilty bothers me, but it's not a huge risk given the gains.<br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>foojin wrote:</strong>-10% chance my buffs will be dispelled with this build right ? seems quite higher to me.</div></blockquote>\n\nNo, it's 5% chance.  You will only be dispelled on a 20 roll.  So 1/20 that each buff will be dispelled.  So each buff has a 5% chance to getting dispelled.  With the number of buffs you have, the chance that at least one buff is dispelled is, however, significantly higher than 5% (around 46% with 12 buffs).</div>"

In fact, I wouldn't change your feat selection at all from your previous build.  My only suggestion was to flip your level 32 and level 40 attribute distribution. So WIS+1 at level 32 and DEX+1 at level 40.  I think I also said to take a Great Wisdom at level 40, but that was a mistake.  Keep your Great Wisdom at level 39. Or, if you prefer, you could switch Armor Skin from level 40 to level 39 (based on your build before this last one) and take that Great Wisdom at level 40.  Waiting on lvl 9 spells will not be a make or break deal for this build.</div>"

It's less gimped than Kail's 25 14 1 spread or your suggested 24 15 1, as it doesn't give up something for playability, just trades it for something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, this is my reasoning here: With ED at 39, I get much earlier undispellability, which is IMO more important to this build than earlier ED. The build as is with earlier ED will only be 5% dispellable at level 40, and the way he took the levels, will be VERY VULNERABLE to dispel pretty much till late 30s. Also, the stat points are so crunched up that he's unable to use lvl 7 and 8 spells till very late in the build, which is IMO not cost effective to get ED earlier. I prefer to get ED as icing to the cake in an already VERY HIGH AC build and have my full clericalness at my disposal much earlier. However, each to their own. <br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless, it's nice to see your growth in such a short time to a point where you're actually giving good suggestions and picking up very specific things like the DEX for WIS exchange in this build once the requirements for ED are fulfilled.

WoF, destruction, implosion, Firestorm, and SoV are all very useful spells. But with the way this build is set up, I would rather have Epic Dodge vs those spells.  I'm not the same kind of player you are though, and I'm definitely not the same kind of player Avado is.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, the vulnerability to dispel does bother me.  I don't play on WoG, so I have no idea how prevalent monsters are with Greater Dispel, etc.  They would definitely be my number 1 knockdown, SA targets.  I could live with the 5% dispellability at level 40, but the much larger dispellability up to full maturity is something that I would probably have to play test.  With proper Spellbook management, I don't think it would be anything a well played Cleric couldn't handle.  However, if we are indeed getting ED early for the sake of playability, are we losing playability from our vulnerability to dispel?  Or are we putting too much emphasis on one spell?  I think a player could go either way with this build and come out with zero issue.  Then again, you could probably make Deekin from SoU a powerhouse by simply giving him some Cleric levels.</div>"

What i like about this one is the option to get CS first (the other route you want ED asap), furthermore you don't really need the ED imo (just cherry on the cake).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, i agree on the code thing but i didn't want to spam another full scroll page in this thread.</div>"

This gives you creeping doom, barskin, lower level true seeing (nice for more dp slots, though true seeing is also available on a stone + helmet). Improved invis you can get from a wand (though easier dispelled). Also you retain cat's grace from the war domain because it's in the animal one and your summons get a bit stronger.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor WoG it means worshipping Ehlonna and removing the need to make a alignment switch when taking the monk level (because with war/trickery you worship Erythnul meaning you are chaotic).</div>"

You can get enough WIS bonus from other item slots and equip an ammy of natural armor in WoG and Creeping Doom is kinda buggy in that prone creatures still get up and run out of the area. On WoG there is a custom AI script that makes creatures not get into areas affected by spells that can hurt them (although somehow Stonehold and SoV don't seem to be treated as \"dangerous\" spells by that script). Animal domain = meh, more powerful summons. Summons are shit, more powerful summons are less shit? May be useful early on, but after 25 it's worthless. True Seeing as a lower level spell is a minor benefit, as I normally extend it so that all my long lasting buffs are at 1 hour per level.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would recommend you to go with Heironeus and get Stoneskin (War and Good) if you don't want to go through the alignment changing.</div>"

One needs to choose properly what to invoke of course. If only I had higher lvl summons it would have been much easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, domain choice is a matter of preference.

I'm currently building a rogue/monk/cleric myself, and had a crazy idea....<br/>\nWhat about a Cleric 15/Monk 1/Rogue 24  split? I know, crazy - just hear me out :)<br/>\nThe guy will be dispellable, yes, but much like Max's Magic Master, he will have a lot of spare buffs. On the other hand, the damage output from Rogue levels will be ENOURMOUS! Imagine this guy hasted with TWF, with 10 attacks per round (hence 4 attacks in the first flurry) sneaking up on an unsuspecting poor soul.... 4x12d6 SA damage, and that's before anyone even gets a chance to fire off a dispell! If (like I want to, mostly for role play) make him a sniper, he will dish out 2 attacks with a short bow (6 APR with rapid shot and haste) in the first flurry, cast imp invis, and come back to haunt you again, maybe thisbtime in melee. <br/>\nWould you think this type of build is viable, or is high dispellability simply not worth the additional damage? Thanks!</div>"

Or would you say that AA is the best (only) viable option to go archer in nwn? Thanks, and sorry for the slight offtopic here.</div>"

I have similar calculations - with all the buffs, Cleric can compete, but only with an unbuffed AA, and considering the AB cap for Cleric, the AA does seem not the better, but actually the ONLY viable option to go full archer in NWN, considering . I saw a number of builds that combine Cleric and AA, for that matter, and tried one myself with AB reaching 72 with all the clerical buffs, but that's a topic for another thread. Thanks!<br/>\nThe Cleric/Monk/Rogue combo does seem a good option for an archer/meleer, considering the buffs and high dex, but the need for PBS and RS in this case would probably gimp the melee prowess somewhat (no KD/IKD or TWF). <br/>\nGreat talking to you, and thanks again!</div>"
