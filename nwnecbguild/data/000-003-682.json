You will see why. I'm conceptualising a Pale Master Build. My concept (as usual) is sub optimal. It's a single player mod build maybe for Swordflight or Aielund. A few things:<br/>\n<br/>\nHas to be half orc CHA based sorcerer (can it get any worse?)<br/>\n<br/>\nI want 2 or 3 levels of BG for dark blessing and then possibly divine shield and turn undead. Does the half orc choice somewhat redeem itself here?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an offensive caster is there and point in using 4 feats to get all the still spell feats or is this ridiculous? The opportunity cost is high, I know. <br/>\n<br/>\nI understand the inherent problems of Sorcerer/PM. What I'm not sure about though, is DC. Does an 18 Sorcerer 10 PM have the same DC as a 28 Sorcerer, albeit with a drastically reduced selection of spells? I can't find a clear explanation on this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've had a go at the first chapter of SF with a sorcerer and did A LOT of quick saving and a huge amount of reloading. The rest restrictions are so brutal. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny help on these issues and any other tips would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Edit: Regarding above, CBC seems to indicate DC is the same. <br/>\n<br/>\nRegards, <br/>\nEltalstro <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Breaches and Mords can lower SR helping with penetration with the exception of SR Monks.<br/>\n- spell foci for better DC might be situationally useful. I like Enchantment and Necromancy.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">You can make decent nuke mages with Sorc26/PM10/BG4, Sorc27/PM10/BG3, or Sorc28/PM10/BG2. They won't be able to achieve max DCs but they can also be built as mediocre DC mages. However, these builds only become decent near level 40 and since SP modules are mainly about the journey to 40 this will be a tough character to level. You can either delay your casting potential and aim for PM10 as soon as possible or you can delay the PM immunities in order to improve your caster level. Either way your build won't develop fully until the 30s, which might be acceptable on a PW but will probably be a pain in a SP module.<br/>\nOn top of that half orc is literally the worst race for your build idea. Human is the best race by far, but even dwarf is better than half orc for this build. So not only are you playing a late developing build, you're also purposefully handicapping yourself while doing so.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want AC then you should go for either Sorc26/PM10/BG4 or Sorc27/PM10/BG3 and get Auto Still Spell 3 and Divine Shield. There is no point getting Divine Shield if you don't also get AS3 since even with the PM bonus your AC will still be low without armor. If you go for AC then ignore DCs and become a nuke mage. Your DCs will be 5 or 6 points lower than a proper DC mage, and at that point it's usually best to ignore DC spells entirely.<br/>\nIf you drop AC then you should go for either Sorc27/PM10/BG3 or Sorc28/PM10/BG2. This frees up more feats but even if you focus on CHA your DCs will still be 3 or 4 points lower than a proper DC mage. In some environments this isn't a big deal, in others this will make building as a DC mage pointless.<br/>\n<br/>\nComparing a human Sorc28/PM10/BG2 and a half orc Sorc28/PM10/BG2, the human has 80 HP and 86 skill points more than the half orc. The half orc can't even invest in discipline due to the low amount of skill points, only Concentration, Spellcraft, and Tumble. Both builds have 32 CHA and ESF: Necro, which is what I suggest aiming for with this build if you want to build as a DC mage.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Do it in robes. With a 17 AC, everything will hit you, but have to go through Epic Warding/Greater Stoneskin and EDR III just to tick away at your HP. Casting in melee will draw AoOs, for even more hits. Each attacker will take 77 + 1d4 + 2d6 damage from the damage shields. There is no check for SR on this damage, and only elemental resistance (acid and fire) will somewhat reduce the damage. On top of that, you'll be hitting with anything that doesn't allow a save.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
