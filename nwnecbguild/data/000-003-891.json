      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Good afternoon ECB, it's about time I posted another high magic build. <br/>\n<br/>\nMeandering about my high magic server when I came up with this guy. I love me a monk/cleric combo but with +10 gear shields just overtake wisdom for AC. With the 20 or so AA's I find myself partying with I designed this guy to be the stalwart shield of the group. I discovered the interaction of dropping epic traps on top of people's faces while doing just that. Add skill mastery and you're good to go. Uncanny dodge lets you keep your dex bonus at least if not your dodge bonus, plus you can stagger trap laying as you see fit. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut even without this synergy which I discovered late you have a high AC tank with some reverence paid to his saves. On my server I have near permanent darkfire and 2-3 extra sources of damage on weapons, plus UMD for DP. <br/>\n<br/>\n112 AC: 46 base + 6 dex buffs + 10 armor + 10 Shield + 10 Boots + 10 amulet + 10 ring + 4 haste + 5 EMA + 1 MA = 112 AC without expertise, also epic dodge. <br/>\n<br/>\nFort/will/ref saves 26/24/35 (35/33/44 against spells)<br/>\n<br/>\n40 unbuffed AB, respectable but nothing special. Popping True Strike right before IKD is still very viable though :) - If you aren't burning through tons of gold per fight you're not really fighting. <br/>\n<br/>\nCloses thing I could find was KailPendragon's \"Paler Sneaker\" but that was a dual wielding stealth flanker without skill mastery and worse saves. Still, very similar concept. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith all that said I feel like this guy could be optimized more. You have a couple feats that can be changed out to accomplish something else. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere he is:<br/>\n<br/>\nRogue(16), Bard(4), Pale Master(20), Halfling<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nSTR: 8<br/>\nDEX: 20 (32)<br/>\nCON: 14<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHalfling: (Fearless, Good Aim, Lucky, Skill Affinity: Listen, Skill Affinity: Move Silently, Small Stature)<br/>\n01: Rogue(1): Expertise<br/>\n02: Bard(1)<br/>\n03: Bard(2): Weapon Finesse<br/>\n04: Bard(3): DEX+1, (DEX=21)<br/>\n05: Pale Master(1)<br/>\n06: Rogue(2): Weapon Focus: Mace, {Evasion}<br/>\n07: Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br/>\n08: Rogue(4): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br/>\n09: Rogue(5): Knockdown<br/>\n10: Rogue(6)<br/>\n11: Rogue(7)<br/>\n12: Rogue(8): DEX+1, Improved Knockdown, (DEX=23)<br/>\n13: Rogue(9)<br/>\n14: Rogue(10): Improved Evasion<br/>\n15: Rogue(11): Iron Will<br/>\n16: Bard(4): DEX+1, (DEX=24)<br/>\n17: Rogue(12)<br/>\n18: Pale Master(2): Toughness<br/>\n19: Pale Master(3): {Darkvision}<br/>\n20: Pale Master(4): DEX+1, (DEX=25)<br/>\n21: Pale Master(5): Armor Skin<br/>\n22: Pale Master(6)<br/>\n23: Pale Master(7)<br/>\n24: Pale Master(8): DEX+1, Epic Weapon Focus: Mace, (DEX=26)<br/>\n25: Pale Master(9)<br/>\n26: Pale Master(10)<br/>\n27: Rogue(13): Epic Dodge, Defensive Roll<br/>\n28: Pale Master(11): DEX+1, (DEX=27)<br/>\n29: Pale Master(12)<br/>\n30: Pale Master(13): Epic Prowess, Epic Energy Resistance: Sonic I<br/>\n31: Pale Master(14)<br/>\n32: Pale Master(15): DEX+1, (DEX=28)<br/>\n33: Pale Master(16): Epic Fortitude, Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor<br/>\n34: Pale Master(17)<br/>\n35: Pale Master(18)<br/>\n36: Pale Master(19): DEX+1, Great Dexterity I, Epic Spell: Epic Warding, (DEX=30)<br/>\n37: Rogue(14)<br/>\n38: Rogue(15)<br/>\n39: Rogue(16): Great Dexterity II, Skill Mastery, (DEX=31)<br/>\n40: Pale Master(20): DEX+1, (DEX=32)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHitpoints: 388<br/>\nSkillpoints: 294<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 26/24/35<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9, Traps: +3, Fear: +2<br/>\nBAB: 24<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 40 (melee), 38 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 44/46<br/>\nSpell Casting: <br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nDisable Trap 42(46), Listen 43(48), Perform 10(9), Search 42(44), Set Trap 32(45), Spellcraft 43(45), Tumble 40(51), UMD 42(41)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Just make sure that you don't  get roasted by your own electric traps. <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\nHigh AC and ED is a good place to start with a tank build. Here you reach the dodge AC cap with +10 equipment.<br/>\nOther features a tank can have are self concealment and DR. Here you can get a wand or a stack of Improved invisibility scrolls to help you out. As for DR you rely on items like swordsman belt etc. <br/>\nIf you are going to tank for a party of archers, knockdown may not be the best idea. Prone creatures are harder to hit with ranged weapons.<br/>\nIf you test the build, let us know how it fares. It does have potential.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If you try too hard, you end up with something weaker.<br/>\nIn my opinion you have to build to meet the challenges where you play. In a high magic module you can find items that protect you against almost everything and also add a lot to your attacks. Then you have to ask yourself: What can the build itself add that you cannot get from items? Then you focus on doing that right and let items take care of the rest.<br/>\nThat is how dexers often are better in high magic environments. They have features that make them hard to hit, and even more so when you equip them with everything. At the same time weapon enhancements give them that extra damage that many of them lack so painfully in low magic worlds.<br/>\nA situation you may end up with in high magic is the \"battle of 20s\", when nobody has high enough AB to be able to hit the high AC opponents and you only hit on a 20 roll. In that case the high AC, ED, SCV builds win the toe to toe combat simply by not being hit, and they win faster when they have many attacks per round.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
