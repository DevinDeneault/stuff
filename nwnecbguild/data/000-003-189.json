First of all I cant seem to use the same link I had saved for the Epic character search engine, is it no longer there???<br/>\n \u00a0<br/>\n I was looking for a WM with a longsword and somewhat good saves.( Maybe even be able to cast GWM for the +5/6 but high AB form WM might just do the trick?)\u00a0Would that be a WM/CoT mix? If so does anyone have something along those lines or any thoughts of something like that?<br/>\n<br/>\n Lvl 40, PvP, any race. +6 items with a cap of\u00a0+12 on stats (Str. Dex, etc.)\u00a0Dev crit does 3x the damage instead of instant death. Not even sure i could work a dev crit into a build like this?<br/>\n<br/>\n So once again good to see you and thanks for your time.<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The_Krit's archive of both the epic and pre-epic legacy builds are all uploaded and accessible through javascipt once you DL the files from the New Vault.\u00a0 I've posted the links in an ECB topic<strong> <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2354480/How-and-Where-to-Access-Legacy-ECB-Archives\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here </a></strong><br/>\n<br/>\n You will need to run the Search Engine on your machine rather than off the web, though.\u00a0 Same builds as before, only you need a browser enabled to digest javascript.\u00a0 Firefox works fine.\u00a0 Apparently Chrome does not.\u00a0 IE complained about ActiveX but ran it after I told it to.<br/>\n<br/>\n One thing to keep in mind though, when/if you refer to those builds... you can't hyperlink.\u00a0 Either furnish a short summary of each build in your post or rely on members to use their own copies of the search to view the referenced builds.\u00a0 Title, Author and Split should be enough for us to find them fast.<br/>\n<br/>\n Are you talking about a cleric/WM or a CoT/WM?\u00a0 Or some combo of the two?\u00a0 If cleric/WM, you'll either need fighter levels (lower saves) right away or be prepared to wade pretty far through pre-epic levels to fulfill the WM prereqs using CoT with its +7 BAB prereq.\u00a0 So those are your secondary and tertiary classes.\u00a0 What were you planning for the primary... cleric, bard, magician, rogue? Those are the only magic-enabled classes.\u00a0 All those won't get bonus feats until epic class levels. \u00a0 BTW, GMW goes +5 max enhancement so if they have +6 wpns you won't be using GMW after you find one.\u00a0 Ummm, could I interest you in a scimi instead?\u00a0 With WM you'll crit a whole lot more and not notice the avg base dmg difference much at all.\u00a0 You could make an ED dexer build with rogue but would need to go rapier for that. \u00a0 And while we are here, are you looking for high-defense or high-damage?<br/>\n<br/>\n Hip<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks for all the info Hip. I was was thinking maybe a CoT with the WM cause I was trying to get high AB/crit range with some saves added to it for PvP. All the best gear/weapons are forged by the player and have a certain amount of PP (slots sort of speak) depending on the weaon. I like Scimi's but they can hold little enchantment cause of their crit range is so great anyway. For example a Scimi holds two PP which will only give me room to make it a +6 weapon(enhancement) and that's it, where a long sword holds 6 PP so I could put +6 and some elemental damage. But I don't mind using one if you think it would still be better. As for the primary I am not sure...I guess it would have to be go Fighter, right? Doesn't have to be a Magic user. Rogue would be nice cause I would be able to use wands that another toon of mine can make.(see invisy and clarity) Would monk add a little AC? So as you can see I am pretty opened just not sure. On this server after you hit 40 you can re-lvl and redo the build except for the first lvl of course. You can also switch alignment at any time.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Well, it was a bit hard to discern your ideas from your request, campgod, tbh.\u00a0 But I am getting the impression you want your basic CoT/WM w/o self-buffing spells.\u00a0 If not the case, a battle cleric CoT/WM would do more damage but DevCrit ~probably~ not in the picture (haven't really thought that concept through yet).<br/>\n<br/>\n Dunno whether you've noticed from past posts, but I am not one to throw out random builds for requests.\u00a0 I would rather builders simply grasp the linkage between what they want (their instincts) and what gets implemented to achieve that... i.e. make their own builds, comparing with similar ones which may have addressed things differently.\u00a0 To that end, here is a combo that goes with the highest base damage SH weapons (katana, bastard, DwarvenWA).\u00a0 Two of those have the same crit range as your longsword so should be able to be enhanced the same way (unless there is still more server-specific info being withheld).\u00a0 Naturally, you could easily gain a pre-epic feat by going longsword, but IMO, if you have the feats (which this build certainly does), exotics are really worth it.\u00a0 Dwarven Waraxe is more typical and has more potential damage but poor crit range will become a liability for grabbing all the epic crit bonuses regularly.\u00a0 If the server doesn't nerf DWaxe, it's worth considering.<br/>\n<br/>\n Human would gain a racial feat but the end potential would be lower.\u00a0 The dwarven racial bonuses seem well worth the short feat to me, anyway.\u00a0 But it is all your choice since you are the one who will be testing it in action.\u00a0 I have not.\u00a0 I only do that for published builds.\u00a0 DL a trainer if you don't have one and make your own tweaks as you notice any shortcomings.\u00a0 So here is the basic plan:<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Ftr8 / CoT10 / WM22, Dwarf, xG/xN</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 18 (34)<br/>\n DEX: 13<br/>\n CON: 14<br/>\n WIS: 8<br/>\n INT: 13<br/>\n CHA: 6<br/>\n<br/>\n AB - 51 (melee), 32 (range), 4 APR<br/>\n AC 28<br/>\n<br/>\n Saves (F/W/R): 29/24/28 (35/30/34 vs spells), Poison +2 (racial)<br/>\n<br/>\nPre-epic - Ftr7/CoT6/WM7, HP 240<br/>\n All bumps to STR<br/>\n Feats: Exotic Prof (katana/bastard/DWaxe),WF, Dodge, Mobility, WS, Expertise, SprAttack, WW, ImpCrit, PA, Cleave, KD, IKD, BF<br/>\n Skills: Disc 23(29), Intimidate 4(2), Spcr 8(9), Tumble 11(12)<br/>\n<br/>\nEpic - Ftr1/CoT4/WM15, HP 480<br/>\n All bumps to STR<br/>\n Feats: GrtSTRx6, EWF, EWS, GrtCleave, Armor Skin, Prowess, OverCrit, Epic Will, DevCrit<br/>\n Skills: Disc 20(55), Spcr11(20), Tumble 9(21)<br/>\n<br/>\n Why DevCrit anyway?\u00a0 Because except for going DevCrit route, WM bonus feats suck.\u00a0 Epic Toughness? Meh.\u00a0 What's the point?\u00a0 Swallow a potion.<br/>\n Saves look darn good to me for a meleer.\u00a0 The only thing I had considered was dropping an AB via -3WM levels to get Called Shot/+1 saves with CoT levels... a great way to effectively increase your relative AC. But that is only an option if you are confortable with the associated attack penalty.<br/>\n<br/>\n Since this supposed to be focused towards PvP, I also suggest stocking up on Invis pots.\u00a0 If you run into any Div Might/Div Shld types, their buffs are easy to strip with hit 'n *poof* tactics and then go toe to toe.\u00a0 IKD/BF vs. caster types, of course... must-haves.\u00a0 Unless you PvP more than a single toon at one time, though, cleave/grt cleave are totally worthless as is WW. WM is an expensive class to invest into, unfortunately.<br/>\n<br/>\n Haven't calculated damage (I'll leave that to your play-testing sessions) but with 1-10 base, WS/EWS +6, STR mod +12, Overcrit and your server's DevCrit boosts it should work out pretty well.\u00a0 You should be able to apply the same enhancements as a longsword and can figure that much in as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n At mimimum, this summary will serve as a metric to weigh other concepts against.\u00a0 Like I said, it's a basic CoT/WM with no frills.<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
