All of the builds are currently just\u00a0theory builds, but I (or anyone else) can create a build guide in CBC if needed. None of the builds will be able to deal with Time Stop spam or epic trap stacking, but that would apply even if they were played by a skilled player.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm assuming that the builds can't use items, can't set traps, and don't need UMD.\u00a0Every build with PM15+, Sorc21+, or Wiz21+ has Epic Warding.\u00a0Some of the builds are hard to kill but lack any real offense, they might not be appropriate for this request. Some of the builds (especially HiPSers) require certain playstyles or tactics that the AI will struggle to use properly.<br/>\n<br/>\n[DC] indicates Devastating Critical, [ED] indicates Epic Dodge, [ASS3] indicates Automatic Silent Spell 3.<br/>\nAnything marked with * probably won't work for this request, either due to alignment restrictions or because the AI will struggle to play it properly.<br/>\nAB/AC values are all rough estimates, effective AB/AC has been excluded. They assume a balanced (not minmaxed) build, +5 AB/EB weapons, +5 AC items, Haste, and +12 to all relevant abilities. Ranged AB for all DEX Melee builds is roughly the same as the listed melee AB.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know what sort of gear is available on WoG, but every build should aim to have 29 Fortitude, 27 Reflex, 27 Will, and 50 Discipline after ability bonuses. Most of the builds can fit in Listen/Spot if vanilla True Seeing is unavailable, although effective detect requires Keen Sense which limits race choice to elf. 5/- or 10/- Magic DRes gear is needed against IGMS spam. Some of the builds can fit in EER: Cold 3+ for Ice Storm spam but Cold DRes gear will be useful too. Most of the melee builds will need Acid and Fire DRes gear to deal with damage shields unless paired with a build that can breach.<br/>\n<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Barb20/Bard4/PM16 - +51 AB. 76 AC.\nCler26/Bard4/PM10 - +63 AB. 68 AC.\nCler28/Bard2/RDD10 [DC] - +66 AB. 66 AC.\nMonk6/Cler26/Figh8 [DC] - +63 AB. 64 AC.\nFigh12/WM25/Rog3 [DC] - +63 AB. 61 AC.\n*Pal20/Bard4/PM16 [DC] or Pal21/Sorc3/PM16 [DC] - +61 AB. 82 AC.\nPal26/Figh12/Rog2 [DC] - +63 AB. 69 AC.\nRang21/Bard3/PM15 [DC] - +57 AB. 66 AC.\nRang28/Bard2/RDD10 [DC] - +61 AB. 64 AC.\nRang30/Monk6/Figh4 [DC] - +55 AB. 59 AC.\n</details>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Monk9/Cler26/SD5 [ED] - +64 AB. 72 AC.\nRang26/Figh4/SD10 [ED] - +58 AB. 67 AC.\nRang26/Rog13/SD1 [ED] - +58 AB. 67 AC.\nRog13/Cler26/SD1 [ED] - +64 AB. 67 AC.\nRog19/Bard5/PM16 [ED] - +52 AB. 84 AC.\nRog25/Figh10/Pal5 [ED] - +51 AB. 75 AC.</details>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>*Bard3/Pal8/AA29 or Sorc2/Pal9/AA29 - +65 AB. 69 AC.\nBard7/RDD10/AA23 [DC] - +62 AB. 63 AC.\nBard9/SD2/AA29 - +67 AB. 60 AC.\nCler28/Bard2/RDD10 [DC] - +63 AB. 58 AC.\nFigh10/Wiz1/AA29 [DC] - +65 AB. 52 AC.\nMonk9/Wiz2/AA29 - +68 AB. 71 AC.</details>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>*Cler27/Wiz12/Monk1 [ASS3] - +57 AB. 69 AC.\nCler38/Monk1/Rang1 [ASS3] - +64 AB. 73 AC. 45 DC Implosion.\n*Monk3/Wiz25/Cler12 [ASS3] - +55 AB. 70 AC.\n*Monk3/Wiz36/SD1 [ASS3] - 66 AC. 42 DC Wail.\nSorc36/Pal3/Monk1 [ASS3] - 72 AC.\n*Wiz24/Cler15/Monk1 [ASS3] - +55 AB. 70 AC.\nWiz29/PM10/Monk1 [ASS3] - 72 AC.</details>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>*Bard6/PM16/DD18 or Wiz6/PM16/DD18 (CON DR Tank) - 76 AC.\n*Dru28/Shif10/Monk2 (Dragon Shape / Rakshasa Shape) - +55 (Dra) AB. 83 (Dra) / 73 (Rak) AC.\n*Pal29/CoT10/Monk1 (Smiter) - +56 AB (+75 max Smite AB). 72 AC.</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

How else do you explain monsters literally suiciding on a Damage-shielded, Epic-Warded Wizard / PM? Pulling an enemy into a green carpet of traps, as it blindly runs to its death with no \"second thoughts\". No matter what we say about this game and how improved WoG AI truly is, the AI in this game, complex as it is, couldn't feasibly be programmed to mimic a PvP build.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's also why PvP is a completely different monster and builds that excel at it wouldn't necessarily excel at PvM. I honestly don't know how good my Magical Master would be at PvP. Possibly good, but I can't say for sure. What would he be facing? What tactics would work? How many immunities would be present? He is the most amazing PvM build I've EVER played. Not a single build I've made comes even close to what this guy can do. This is coming from the guy who made Champion of the Wilderness, The Shadow Priest and Demolition Man, 3 of the most played and powerful builds in the guild. Having played all of them to 40, the discrepancy in power is BRUTAL. I can't stress that enough. Where the Shadow Priest would break a sweat to solo an encounter, the Magical Master just cruises through, sometimes killing the enemy without even getting hit once. But I doubt the AI would be able to do what I do when I play him.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a Wizard / Cleric, when you memorize spells, you memorize multiple copies of them because you have to last through the day, and you conserve your spells for tougher battles, even if it takes longer to kill some wasy mobs. Sometimes I don't even buff with my long-term buffs, except EMA until the final battle or an underboss or something. You normally prepare spells that would work against the enemy you're planning to face, not \"a spell for each possible enemy type\", etc... As an example, when I face Drow, who are Spell Resistant, ALL my level 3 spells are Extended Death Armor, ALL my level 4 spells are Extended Haste, ALL my level 5 spells are Extended Elemental Shield, ALL my level 6 spells are Extended Mestil's Acid Sheath, All my level 7 spells are Extended Greater Stoneskin (and level 7 Cleric are Word of Faith cuz it penetrates SR), and ALL my level 8 slots are Premonitions. Alternatively, if I'm facing non-SR enemies, I'll take 3 of each of the shields or none, depending on how often I expect or even want to get hit, and memorize ALL IGMSs at 6, Bigby 7 / Extended Bigby 6 at 7 / Empowered IGMSs at 8, etc.. I normally cast from self-crafted scrolls A LOT, so I never memorize Bigby 9, but I have 50 stacks of Bigby 9 scrolls that I can use if need be. I also ALWAYS use Summon Creature 9 / Stoneskin to bait breaches from scrolls, and then I have 50 scrolls of Bigby 5 to lower enemy AB by 10, and 50 scrolls of Greater Sanctuary to escape, etc.... I don't think that kind of versatility can be replicated by the AI. Imagine an NPC casting Greater Sanctuary and just running away cuz the odds aren't in his favor that day? LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, there is a FUNDAMENTAL difference, an AI-controlled NPC needs to just survive this ONE battle, and be effective in it. I don't know how that would change memorized spells for the Magical Master. Perhaps I could think about a specific spell configuration for that build to fight a party of NPCs, but I don't even know in what order he'd cast them. It's too many options and too many variables, and one can't be prepared for \"everything\".<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Thus, it died on the vine, never reaching conclusive results, despite best intentions from all parties.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't mean for this to sound negative - as I said, I like the concept. I think Mick has presented the other potential problems - and at least when playing our builds we get to improve our playstyles and skills, but when handing them over to AI to implement it could get tricky if it doesn't do what the creator knows it should/could do.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do hope something concrete can be made here, I'm just not quite sure what atm (though I do rather like Mick's idea for \"tag teams\" or small parties, I confess).<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div></blockquote>\nFWIW, I think the Hall of Fame is doable, if we're open enough to consider different playstyles. Like, we have GREAT STR-juggernaut builders here. I'm not one of them, but I've made a few. Valerfor, TyrTemplar, and many others have made a lot more (and possibly enjoy playing them a lot more) than I have. I would be kind of considered a Cleric specialist, as that's my favorite class and playstyle. Then Mick is the KING of sneaky characters and AAs, having made some really awesome builds in both. GDL is an all-round world-class builder who has made pretty much a great build in all areas. A Hall of Fame should certainly contain some of his...<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe there could be categories, and within a said category, there could be criteria to establish, but it'd be a LOT of work to define. Maybe more than it's worth. And then there are builds like my Magical Master or The Squid's Wood Witch, who don't necessarily fit in one specific category. Hmm..<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">For a proper challenge I would recommend a base of 2/3 mobs for 1 player and adding 1/2 more mobs for every additional player in the party. I'm also not sure how you will spawn the mobs but I recommend splitting them into categories and then spawning based on those categories. For example, if you spawn two mobs then one would be a melee build and one would be a caster, with more mobs changing the overall party composition. The spawned mobs could also be based on the player's builds, but that might require more effort than it's worth.<br/>\n<br/>\nI recommend nerfing Time Stop (add a timer, only affect creatures within a radius instead of within an area, change the actual effect, disable completely, etc) and trap stacking in the area that these fights will take place in. Damage shields, Harm, Ice Storm, and IGMS are also problem spells that will need to be accounted for, either with DI/DR or spell changes. Relying on the AI to breach/dispel damage shields won't work for the simple reason that players are smarter than AI, consider adding a random chance to remove damage shields with OnHit weapons or every x seconds in the area. Limiting magic item use would also make for a better challenge, either by preventing it completely or by adding a limit of x uses per day once in the area.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure what gear/effects the builds will have but at a minimum I'd recommend +12 to the relevant abilities (possibly +12 to all abilities), permahaste, +10ish universal saves, +25ish to all relevant skills (excluding Spellcraft), and 32 spell resistance. Consider adding basic spells (or spell-like abilities) such as Darkness, Improved Invisibility, Lesser Restoration, Negative Energy Protection, Silence, True Seeing, breaches, dispels, heals, and mantles to all of the builds. For DI/DR I'd recommend a minimum of 50% Negative DI and 5/- Magic DRes for all builds. Consider adding\u00a0Divine DI/DR for certain spells and 50% Acid/Cold/Fire DI for Ice Storm and damage shields. Weapon damage and physical DI/DR are also important but they would need to be adjusted based on available player gear.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat sort of immunity gear will the mobs have access to?<br/>\nFor example if they all have access to mind spell immunity then the value of Monk20 and high will saves decreases.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat sort of immunity gear will the players have access to?<br/>\nI'm aware that knockdown immunity is available on WoG, so the only real use for knockdown effects like KD/IKD, Bigby6, and Grease is to force players to equip knockdown immunity gear. If freedom gear is easily available then any Assassin build is useless (even more so than usual), immunities limit the useful spells that DC casters can use, etc.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'd normally suggest Exalted Sorc but Exalted's 250hp I think in practice might die too fast to a few Emp/Max IGMS in a 1v1 battle. 2v2 might be a bit different but I think one will want the AI to still use Time Stop / Mord / Bigby and Emp/Max IGMS. Sad to not have DC casting but as Yunim mentioned the immunities players might have can make DC casting weaker (well.. except some spells like Flesh to Stone and Implosion)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Torias's <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/rogue-archer-rogue-33-fighter-6-shadowdancer-1-t515471.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rogue Archer</a> (Rogue 33 / Fighter 6 / SD 1) - Epic Dodge, HiPS, <strong>+27d6 sneak </strong>with up to 6 APR with rapid shot and haste. EWS too. This really should be at the top of the list of what I don't want to face. Potentially 972 sneak damage / round with 6 APR. Not sure how we can get the AI to stay within 30 feet to maximize ranged sneak attacks though.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Valefor's Panthro or My <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/draconic-professor-of-war-fighter-28-bard-2-rdd-10-t2355186.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Professor of War with 50 AB</a>\u00a0(Fighter 28 / Bard 2 / RDD 10) - big dev critters with ridiculous strength and AB, UMD, +4 RDD AC and fire immunity<br/>\n<br/>\n- Some of Max's or GDL's implosion focused clerics. I <strong>never </strong>want to tank implosion from a high wisdom cleric. It will go through death immunity and gets an additional bonus to most lvl 9 spells (which I am unsure why, but it is there). Shadow Priest, Demolition Man, Vicar of the Void.<br/>\n<br/>\n- My <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/greatsword-kensai-monk-35-fighter-4-rogue-1-t2355451.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Greatsword Kensai</a> (Monk 35 / Fighter 4 / Rogue 1) - +110 speed, spell resistance 51, dev crit greatsword, improved knockdown, improved disarm, mind immunity, UMD to cast any spell. I don't want to face that.<br/>\n<br/>\n- A dragon shape build with monk in it. I think Max's Champion of the Wilderness. As long as the character can use a rod of fast buffing to load up all the buffs rapidly before turning into a dragon, that would be good.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus some sort of near pure evil ranger, perhaps Ranger 35 with favored enemies against every player race. Rangers are deadly. Grimnir and Mick posted up pure rangers in the ECB archives. I'd take those builds, ensure they are dex based (sorry I can't remember) and add monk 3 (for speed) and shadowdancer 2 (for HiPS and uncanny dodge). With a crazy stealth score from camouflage and HiPS and vanilla true seeing being unlikely to be present on the player (with some exceptions such as Dragon Shape builds) that is an encounter I would fear.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The AB/AC values in my second post can be used as a guide for what a balanced level 40 build can achieve in a +5 environment, and also as a guide for potential builds that your mobs could face.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost ECB builds are designed for PvM, and even the best PvM builds usually require some editing to become decent PvP builds. Fresh PvP builds could be designed with this specific environment in mind (which would require more information about what buffs/gear is available), but they would still not be good enough because WoG is not designed with PvP balance in mind.<br/>\nSo if you do choose to use ECB builds directly instead of as inspiration for toolset mobs you will need to change the environment to make the builds more threatening.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome problem spells have been nerfed on WoG but they haven't been nerfed enough for a balanced PvP environment.<br/>\nHarm being limited to 250 Negative damage and IGMS being limited to 15 missiles per target doesn't really matter when Time Stop &gt; True Strike &gt; Harm &gt; Harm &gt; Repeat or Time Stop &gt; IGMS &gt; IGMS &gt; Repeat are still viable tactics. Even 50% Negative DI and 5/- Magic DRes would only change those damage cycles from 500 -&gt; 250 damage and 360 -&gt; 210 damage respectively, it wouldn't prevent the tactics from working. WoG's rest-limiting might prevent these tactics when facing multiple 2000+ HP mobs at once, but in a 1v1 fight (even three back-to-back) against an opponent with 700ish HP that won't be enough.<br/>\nDamage shield stacking will be a big problem for almost every melee build, even with 50% Acid/Fire DI that's still 50ish damage per hit against high level mages.<br/>\nOther spells such as Black Blade Of Disaster, Greater Sanctuary, Word Of Faith, healing (both items and spells), and speed increasing spells will also need to either be changed or balanced around in the arena.<br/>\n<br/>\nItems also play a big part in PvP balance, such as available immunity gear and traps (particularly epic trap stacking).<br/>\nHowever even things like unlimited Clarity potions, Lesser Spell Breach wands, and Mordenkainen's Disjunction scrolls have a large effect on what builds and tactics are viable. Any build that relies on buffs with less than 27 caster levels effectively doesn't have any buffs. Damage shields and mantles are borderline useless against prepared players. Casters are limited to a very small selection of spells (Flesh To Stone, Harm, Ice Storm, IGMS, Implosion, Undeath To Death (undead shifters only), Word Of Faith, etc) and even they can be effectively ignored if the player has enough mantle scrolls.<br/>\nI'm not as concerned about melee/ranged damage since weapons can easily be created to deal with the 20/- DRes items that players have access to, but that's also something to bear in mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nDevastating Critical is worth it's own thread, but I'll just say that there's a reason for most PvP servers either removing or editing Dev Crit.<br/>\nAny mob that isn't critical immune and doesn't have absurd (85+)\u00a0AC\u00a0will die eventually regardless of how high it's Fort is. I suggest using a balanced Cler28/Bard2/RDD10 with +65 AB and full cleric casting as a benchmark PvP build for how powerful Dev Crit can be. It can force most opponents into becoming flatfooted and then use Dev Crit to finish off anything that Harm spam can't.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
