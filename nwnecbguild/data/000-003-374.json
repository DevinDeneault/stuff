Assuming no dex buffs, you're actually at less AC than a plate wearer (8 full plate +1 DEX = 9 AC vs +7 dex modifier for this dex'er).  Though a lot of the comparison will really depend on environment - how relevant is the 6-12 difference in strength modifier damage, what types of damage bonuses are available on weapons, what are common builds you see in PvP, how much dispelling do you see, enchantment level, is there easy access to haste, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon't get me wrong - I love that build, both the elf and halfling versions....that and Blood and Faith are my go-to builds on PWs.  But I like it a lot more in the mid-30s to 40 than I do at 20.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first thought was a Ftr4 Bard 16.  A crap ton of quality buffs, disablers, as well as +7 effective AB/AC from Bard + Curse Song, good skill points, damage shield against sonic (sonic resistance is much less common that acid/fire resist), can use Taunt (with or without expertise), and not having to blow feats on Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, and WWA makes up for losing 3 FTR bonus feats (at FTR 6, 8, 10) compared to the WM build.  Only tricky part would be getting the extra +7 perform points (needs 30) for the 16th level bard song.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hey Dante!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt depends on what kinds of items are available. If he can get +12 DEX, the DEXer will have a better AC than the FP wearer, but you're right, not by a lot, definitely the damage from STR will be more useful. I did say that I was no expert in building for level 20, so you're most likely right.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd go with Dante's idea, man. Ftr 4 Bard 16 is a melee-based toon that will have to unequip armor to buff, but should be very powerful.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

      "content": "<div>A tweaked version of the knight I posted in the other thread should work. You get 4 AC from Parry added to what it says below, but -3 from not carying a shield. If you carry a +1 tower shield, the armor will be the same, and if the tower shield is better than +1, you are better off with a shield than Parry.
