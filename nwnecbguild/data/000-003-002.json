With a rogue ? <br/>\nNot sure monk can be a frontline warrior. I am always wanted to build a ultimate monk. But always lacking of concepts. Please help me up. You can post your built and tell me about why it is a Must built to build one. Hehehe. Thanks</div>"

Server is still new so I am not very sure about their intensity on magic environment. It's lalaland. Not sure if you hear of that. Let's say Kamas for example. Dev crit are banned. Epic dodge is great. Do I need high ac if I have epic dodge? At the first glance, I am thinking Cleric Monk + something else? Rogue? SD? Assa? COT? Fighter?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll items are pretty capped at +2. No haste item, Dev banned.</div>"

A cleric heavy build is playable in any setting. Dex Base for Epic Dodge. It's a late dodger.

      "content": "<div>An unarmed Monk is better that a kama Monk in a low-magic world, Clerics are always good, especially in low-magic worlds, your world allows GMW and DF on fists, so the obvious choice is an unarmed Cleric / Monk, but there are problems with that. You need at least 16 levels of Monk for the d20 unarmed damage, and at least 24 levels of Cleric to be undispellable, but that leaves no room for a third class, and more importantly, you either get that d20 damage really late, or you get your last Tumble skill dump really early, which gives you a lower AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bottom line is that Grimnir's suggestion with dual kamas is likely to be better, even though you lose the d20 damage for a mere d6 damage.</div>",
