There is some chance of PVP, but likely not the focus of gameplay. Here is some relevant info about the game environment in regards to this character:<br/>\n<br/>\nLeveling is uncapped but slow. Viable endgame is between level 25-30 (This alone can take several months), so play-ability throughout leveling is important<br/>\nBarbarian rage does not count towards +12 attribute cap, provides flat AB and damage increase instead. It also adds physical damage immunity<br/>\nDev Crit is disabled<br/>\n<br/>\nMagic items are capped at +3<br/>\nA lot of save-free spells have been nerfed: Bigby's, IGMS, ect.. to be not as effective. (IGMS has damage lowered, bigby's is easy to resist with str)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy ideal build would be a barbarian that has strong damage and decent damage reduction as well as high saving throws. Looking to tackle game content in party play and some soloing.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo race or weapon preference.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Otherwise, going full strength Barb and mixing in some Rogue and possibly a third class like fighter is always good and easy fun. Possibly going CoT for better saves at the cost of damage.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
