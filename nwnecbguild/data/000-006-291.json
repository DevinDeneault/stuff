      "content": "<div><strong>Champion-at-Arms, Fighter(28), Bard(2), Champion of Torm(10)</strong><br/>\nBy Tyr Templar <br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>Author\u2019s Note:</strong> This build, with honourable mention out to Mick Dagger and Max Kane (the \"Yardstick Gang\"), is a multi-classed version of the Man-at-Arms, Fighter(38), Bard(2), a simple yet effective 2-class build that makes for a very well rounded (very good/strong) warrior designed for PvM/E, with a nice (high) AB, good HPs, and rather exciting damage output and options for delivering same thanks not only to high STR but also Fighter WS/EWS on not just one but four (4) different weapons. Thus, dishing all 3 physical damage types (and does so by the bucket loads!)--i.e., slashing, bludgeoning and piercing, and with different sized weapons as well; namely, large 2-handers (for the 1.5 STR boni to damage, and size bonus in the game of disarm) and also medium sized scimitar which chews through foes quickly while enabling use of the Big Board for AC, with expertise for more, and thus a good defense as well, especially for a melee. Also has a nice skill-set for a melee, thanks to Bard, which adds flavor (access to arcane items, bard toys) along with an inspiring song. Main weakness of that build were the saves (excepting fort, but especially will as is so typical of melee, and definitely want to put bard entitlement to good use so as to shore up same PvM/E). <br/>\n<br/>\nBy bringing CoT into the mix, we create the Champion-at-Arms, with CoT among other things shoring up the saves across-the-board and does so without in any way detracting whatsoever from the original build, everything completely intact (other than CoT's any <strong>non-evil </strong>alignment restriction), so as to enjoy your Champion not just PvM/E but also PvP. This, because CoT results in what are now nice saves across-the-board, and especially Fort (which is great as opposed to just good as per the original build, and it's especially wonderful v spells). Has a decent will save even (so nice to see on a melee build), with bard access to arcane items, etc. still, and additional access now also to Divine Wrath (open with Charisma item, potion, etc.). In other words, makes a strong warrior even stronger, there being no such thing as too much saves, especially not if looking to PvP your Champion, and which is discussed in more detail here:   <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/man-at-arms-ftr38-bard2-4-weapon-specializations-t2295575.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">man-at-arms-ftr38-bard2-4-weapon-specializations-t2295575.html</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nWithout any further ado, please meet:</div></blockquote>\n<strong>Champion-at-Arms\u2014Fighter(28), Bard(2), CoT(10)</strong><br/>\n<strong>By Tyr Templar</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Concept:</strong> The Champion-at-Arms is a highly trained, heavily armed medieval officer, with specialized training in Blades (medium and large), Heavy Flail and the Polearm, thus mastery in them all, with great fortitude which, in the midst of battle, binds the will firmly to the good of reason in the face of the greatest of evils, thus permitting action to secure and defend the greater good, notwithstanding the fear of death, and does so while humming an inspiring tune so as to further rally and inspire the troops.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>I.

Another option if prefer access to monk gear, possibly some obscure cleric items as opposed to taunt is to train UMD instead, depending of course on what gear\u2019s available on your world, or otherwise as you want. As always, players are free to adjust their Champion to suit their needs/preferences. <br/>\n<br/>\n----<br/>\n<br/>\nSlash, Bludgeon and Pierce ON! ~ Tyr<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: remove typo(s).</div>"
