I mean I don't want any weapon focus or any weapon at all just spellcasting.Also the build that I liked the most was exalted sorceress,That build was just Amazing I loved the way it was built sooo have in mind something like that but as a Wizard.<br/>\n<br/>\n So onto the guidelines<br/>\n 1)PvP based\u00a0<br/>\n 2)Level cap is 40<br/>\n 3)Human if possible but is debatable if it's to gain power\u00a0<br/>\n 4)Wizard all the way some other class levels just for skills if needed<br/>\n 5)I'm looking for strong offensive spells,I like necromancy the most<br/>\n<br/>\n Also if we could make the exalted sorceress playable (just some tweaks I guess) I might be happy to play that instead of trying to make a new build\u00a0<br/>\n I play on the server The three towns so not many changes just that you can't cast while in expertise or improved expertise and that you can stack mestils acid sheath death armor etc.<br/>\n Also\u00a0<span style=\"color:#D5D4D4\">A caster gains +1 to spell DCs for every 2 levels past 20 in their casting class</span><br/>\n so thtas the reason to go Wiz40 but I guess 38 would be fine too<br/>\n (maybe more but I can't remember right now)<br/>\n So that is all I wait for your feedback and try to work out something that I like :) Peace out !<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
