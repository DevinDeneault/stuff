      "content": "<div>Hail, ECBers.<br/>\n<br/>\n This class combo is absolutely common. It has been done, redone, and then done some more again. So, why post this? Well, the way I see it, the people who have posted builds with this class combo have focused on HIGH AC. Most of the builds I have seen in the search engine are more of the same. Good defensive builds with a high AC. Some go DEX and others go STR, but I believe this one here is the only one that does the following: makes OFFENSIVE choices with a DEFENSIVE class combo. Two builds in particular come closer to this concept, as you'll see further down, but none do it this way.<br/>\n<br/>\n Well, you see this and you think: A high AC build with lots of immunities, right? Right<br/>\n Then you see the spread and you think: Hmm Lasting Inspiration on a full Bard Song, right? Right again.<br/>\n<br/>\n What you might not see is the path it takes to get there. Let me illustrate:<br/>\n<br/>\n For starters, what is remarkable about this build is that it spends pretty much ALL its life without having critical hit immunity. In fact, I leave the PM goodies as the last thing to get in the build. That means that what I did with this combo was to focus on the offensive aspects of the build, leaving just enough defense (besides what the class combo already offers) to get by. True, this build only gets Critical Hit immunity at level 40, but it is very playable before that exactly because it doesn't strive to get it as soon as possible. What is the most glaring weakness of this class combo? Mediocre AB, right? Does this build suffer from that? Not at all! However, one of the great strengths, which is Critical Hit immunity is also absent throughout the leveling.<br/>\n<br/>\n Starting out with 10 Bard Levels, you have Improved Invisibility ASAP, and maxing out your Strength boni from RDD at level 23 while maintaining Taunt, Tumble and UMD up to date with dumps ensures you progress smoothly to that point, having no AB problems or AC problems (thanks to Expertise: Taunt / Expertise combo). After that, your AC and AB should be quite respectable, so that you don't need Taunt / Expertise, but it's still nice to have in many situations. Full Bard Spellbook then becomes available, and Bard song (and therefore Curse Song too) gets to its ideal level (bard 16) at level 26 and from that point on, you start investing in PM levels. At that point, you have +7 AB and AC from Curse Song and Bard Song simultaneously, and enough uses to last you through the day. Then the PM immunity becomes a formality, as you're already a beast without it.<br/>\n<br/>\n Some items (such as Divine Power scrolls) should compliment your battle strategy nicely. As long as there are no mages, here is what you do: Sing first, then run in, get surrounded, turn on Expertise as you run to the enemy. Wait until you get surrounded and use Curse Song followed by the DP scroll and Taunt (if necessary, not to waste any buffed time). After that just watch and rebuff when the song expires. This should be enough to get you through battles with melee and ranged enemies. Against mages, use invisibility, KD them and when they're gone you focus on the rest. Mages first, always! It would be MUCH better if I had Devcrit, but I just can't afford the pre-epic feats to qualify for it. It would require making it much more unplayable and I'm not willing to go there. However, this guy's crits should be painful nevertheless.<br/>\n<br/>\n From level 36 on, you probably won't need to fear KDs, Disarms or anything except Taunt. 66 Discipline is very very good<br/>\n<br/>\n One of the main pains in the neck is having to remove the armor to buff up. This is countered by going with an Elven Chainmail and some DEX gear / potions. You should carry a shield and a 1-handed weapon around as well for when you need more AC than you need AB. In the rest of the situations, you should just hack away.<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, without delay: The Cursed Half-Dragon Chanter<br/>\n<br/>\n Bard(20), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Pale Master(10), Human<br/>\n<br/>\n Alignment: Any non-lawful, non-good<br/>\n<br/>\n Playability: 1-40 PvM<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 18 (38)<br/>\n DEX: 8<br/>\n CON: 10 (12)<br/>\n WIS: 8<br/>\n INT: 14 (16)<br/>\n CHA: 14 (16)<br/>\n<br/>\n Human: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n 01: Bard(1): Knockdown, Weapon Proficiency Martial<br/>\n 02: Bard(2)<br/>\n 03: Bard(3): Expertise<br/>\n 04: Bard(4): STR+1, (STR=19)<br/>\n 05: Bard(5)<br/>\n 06: Bard(6): Extend Spell<br/>\n 07: Bard(7)<br/>\n 08: Bard(8): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n 09: Bard(9): Curse Song<br/>\n 10: Bard(10)<br/>\n 11: Red Dragon Disciple(1)<br/>\n 12: Bard(11): STR+1, Blind Fight, (STR=21)<br/>\n 13: Red Dragon Disciple(2): (STR=23)<br/>\n 14: Red Dragon Disciple(3)<br/>\n 15: Red Dragon Disciple(4): Improved Critical: Greatsword, (STR=25)<br/>\n 16: Red Dragon Disciple(5): STR+1, (STR=26)<br/>\n 17: Bard(12)<br/>\n 18: Red Dragon Disciple(6): Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br/>\n 19: Red Dragon Disciple(7): (CON=12)<br/>\n 20: Red Dragon Disciple(8): STR+1, (STR=27)<br/>\n 21: Red Dragon Disciple(9): Armor Skin, (INT=16)<br/>\n 22: Bard(13)<br/>\n 23: Red Dragon Disciple(10): {Darkvision}, (STR=31), (CHA=16)<br/>\n 24: Bard(14): STR+1, Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword, (STR=32)<br/>\n 25: Bard(15)<br/>\n 26: Bard(16)<br/>\n 27: Bard(17): Epic Prowess<br/>\n 28: Pale Master(1): STR+1, (STR=33)<br/>\n 29: Pale Master(2)<br/>\n 30: Pale Master(3): Great Strength I, (STR=34)<br/>\n 31: Pale Master(4)<br/>\n 32: Bard(18): STR+1, (STR=35)<br/>\n 33: Pale Master(5): Great Strength II, (STR=36)<br/>\n 34: Pale Master(6)<br/>\n 35: Pale Master(7)<br/>\n 36: Pale Master(8): STR+1, Epic Skill Focus: Discipline, (STR=37)<br/>\n 37: Bard(19)<br/>\n 38: Pale Master(9)<br/>\n 39: Bard(20): Lasting Inspiration<br/>\n 40: Pale Master(10): STR+1, (STR=38)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 322<br/>\n Skillpoints: 280<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 21/23/19<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9<br/>\n BAB: 25<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 43 (melee), 25 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 29/37<br/>\n Spell Casting: Bard(6)<br/>\n Alignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\n Discipline 42(66), Lore 27(50), Open Lock 1(0), Perform 42(45), Spellcraft 43(46), Taunt 42(45), Tumble 40(39), UMD 42(45)<br/>\n<br/>\n Similar Builds:<br/>\n<br/>\n Undead Dragon Skald by Ithacan<br/>\n Undead Dragon Skald with Elf ears v.3 by Ithacan<br/>\n Mini Dracolich by SirGunky<br/>\n Clarissa the Punk Rocker by DaMouse Same spread, but he goes for CON for EDR.<br/>\n Revised Avatar of Ruin by Wildeyes<br/>\n Unnamed build by Herbie Shimmer<br/>\n Grim Bard by Zhoreb<br/>\n Black Widow by Grimnir77<br/>\n The Singing Kukri's by wi11ow<br/>\n Skeletal Skald by Cinnabar Din This guy is similar in concept, but doesn't get 10 RDD levels<br/>\n Andariel the Irredeemable by DarkInfernoo This is the most similar build of all of these.

      "content": "<div>Answering your question:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- Expertise is EXTREMELY USEFUL at low levels, in fact it's more useful than anything. You need to learn how to properly use the Expertise / Taunt combo. This way you'll have up to +6 to AB and / or +5 to AC or anything inbetween depending on the difference between your Taunt roll and the opponent Concentration check. That adds a lot of maneuverability to the start of the build. Read my Paladin guide for more information on this:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/the-holy-class-a-guide-to-paladins-t515492.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Holy Class: A Guide to Paladins</a><br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you understand how to use this combo, you'll see things in a whole new light.<br/>\n<br/>\n2- Because you need you buffs to last longer more than you need to buff while in armor. Plus where I play there are suits of armor that have no spell failure, and I plan to equip this toon with one of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"
