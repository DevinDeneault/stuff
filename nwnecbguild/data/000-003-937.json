Finding it quite difficult. Is this a viable build? It seems to stretch the ability scores too broadly to make a strong toon. I was even going to make this my first build that I've actually typed out but it isn't quite making the cut in the arena.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) PvM<br/>\n2) Level cap 20<br/>\n3) Race preference: human<br/>\n4) Class preference: What I've been trying is Fighter (6) to cover the feats needed then WM (7) then either Paladin or cleric. Paladin takes ages to get Divine Might and Shield whereas you can do it with only 2 levels of Cleric but then you don't get Divine grace.\u00a0<br/>\n5) Melee preference - Trying to squeeze exotic and BS in there but might be better to go longsword. All the feats necessary for WM + power attack, cleave. Can't seem to squeeze blind fight in there.\u00a0<br/>\n6) Range preference NA<br/>\n7) Weapon preference - Bastard sword<br/>\n8) Maximum item enhancement Up to +5 for most items<br/>\n9) Spellcasting - No emphasis on casting as wisdom needs to stay low to get the necessary ability scores<br/>\n10) Custom factors - can't think of any<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas would be appreciated.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

E.G.: <br/>\n<br/>\n1- Pal (1) - Power Attack<br/>\n2- Pal (2)<br/>\n3- Pal (3) - Divine Might<br/>\n4- Fighter (1) - Expertise<br/>\n5- Fighter (2) - Dodge<br/>\n6- Pal (4) - Divine Shield.<br/>\n<br/>\nParticularly for this build, it doesn't really matter if it's Pal 5 / Fighter 8 or Pal 4 Fighter 9, since the level cap is 20. If you were to extend it to 40, then Pal 4 would be better, as you'd likely want a (few) fighter level (s) in epics for an (few) extra bonus feat (s).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, let's leave it there for educational purposes anyway.

The reason I went with (8/ 4/ 8) I think is because you get a slightly better reflex save that way, but this is a trivial matter, one can argue that Paladin 5 is better because you can max-out \"Taunt\" that way and so on...These things are better left to the individual that plays the build, as long as the core of the build is strong then slight variations are encouraged in order to make it your own.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am glad you are having fun eltalstro, that's what matters the most.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I kinda like the low Con build on 'Very Difficult' because it adds some realism to the game in that if you take a hard critical you really get into trouble. It adds a serious challenge and make you really plan what you will do before each battle.

One Critical hit from a tough enemy knocks her round pretty badly but she is very hard to hit. One curious thing that I have noticed is that Tomi (at level 8) has the same attack bonus (14/9) as my character does at\u00a0fighter 6, paladin 2. Tomi's BA is only 6 whereas my character has a BA of 8. Both are using +1 weapons. Unbuffed, Tomi has weapon finesse with his Kukri and +4 dex Bonus whereas my PC has +4 strength bonus. What gives? Surely there should be 2 points difference in the two characters attack rolls shouldn't there?<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nEltalstro<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I just fired up the OC and Tomi starts with a Dex of 18 (at least in my version), so at level 8 it should be 20. That would account for the other +1AB.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note, eltastro, are you actually using Tomi as your tank until your HPs develop? Blimey!<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Sorry, misread the Tomi stats - he starts with a 17 Dex, but has a +1 Dex item on him that I can't see due to not being to access a henchie's inventory in the OC (I know you can get a mod for that, but I never travel with one there, so why would I bother?), because his stats are otherwise impossible<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

No Stag, Verala Steelmaiden is doing ok as a low constitution tank (a what?). The henchmen tend to get absolutely owned by mobs on very difficult, so I put them on ranged only/run away when possible. Tomi has armour equipped that has a max dex bonus of 4 (indicated in red on his character sheet). When he uses ranged he also has +14/+9 attack bonus. Curiously, he is using \"Sharwyn's Shortbow +1\" but I guess he IS a thief. The way I see it, even with the racial bonus he should still be 1 lower on AB with the same +4 ability modifier for PC and hench of Str and Dex respectively. Of course, as has been noted (but I had not really considered), henchmen don't have to follow the rules in every case.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I've been playing this game for 15 years and I\u00a0didn't know that at all. Shows how often I play dex based characters. I've probably made more clerics than anything in my time and I've just always made sure any high dex characters have armour that doesn't lower the ability modifier.\u00a0I'll put the stats for the build, up to level 9, up shortly. I tried to do it tonight but what I've put into the CBC is slightly different to what I've done in-game. In-game I've managed to squeeze in all of the requirements for WM plus weapon specialisation,\u00a0power attack and improved crit bastard sword. I can't figure out how I managed to squeeze improved crit in there in the game as I can't get it to work out in the CBC. No time to play around with it right now. Looking at taking the 1st level of WM at level 10 with 8 levels of Fighter and 1 of Paladin.
