      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">I started a YT channel to document all the tough fights in Swordflight starting in Ch.3. I use a build that is mostly caster lvls but have beaten all those encounters with melee and have not used offensive magic during them and have not really used any at all except in a few situations where I used scrolls and rods.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe build started as Human Cleric, War/Magic domains, then 1 lvl sorc for true strike, then 3 lvls of Pal, this ended Ch.1. Ch.2+3 its been nothing but Sorc lvls and I'm pretty sure I wont take any other dips into Pal. I did incur an XP penalty doing this that may have scaled down a few of the tough encounter spawns\u00a0 early in Ch.3.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStarting as cleric was for turn undead and access to cleric only scrolls that Pal can't use. Extend, Empower and Cleave have been very important feats. I took spell focus necromancy but haven't had to use any offensive magic on these tough fights and haven't used any at all besides a few fights here and there where I used a rod. I might \"cheat\" and respec that to Evocation, not sure yet but I've been able to just gish all the tough fights even though they do end up being time consuming.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCheck out the channel here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@kainenmorden\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/@kainenmorden</a><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Also in many modules (I don't know this one) there are things like archer's belts,swordsman's belt etc. Giving additional resistance to piercing,cutting, and blunt attacks respectively. <br/>\n<br/>\nI like to use darkness spells (when I have true seeing/ultravision) and grease spells to make enemies easier to hit. When they're down on the ground, they're easy to hit. In this module, one might have to stay on the periphery of the grease area. It sounds like to me that knockdown protection is not that common.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If he has a spell mantle up, Flame arrow will be very effective to strip it away because every arrow counts as a lvl 3 spell attack.<br/>\nIf you face multiple mages, Wail can be very effective unless they all have their spell mantles up.

Personally I can enjoy both.<br/>\nSometimes playing  flawed characers gives more options for roleplay. And playing a character without a pre-set build progression  can give greater RP freedom when developing the character according to what happens during play, at the cost of optimisation of the build power wise. But you can still be a good roleplayer and enjoy great roleplay even if your character is powerful.<br/>\nWhat I don't like is the attitude of people saying \"only what I do is the right thing\".<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I think it would be impossible to balance anything for the PRC, too many races/class combinations. <br/>\n<br/>\nI've corresponded with the creator of the module quite a bit in the past. He designed it for experienced nwn players that wanted a challenge and he assumed they would power build. He also designed it so that a non optimized character could complete it with the right tactics. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis user also complained that the monster power lvls are \"wrong\" because the module gives them abilities/stats that they didn't have in base NWN. <br/>\n<br/>\nI pointed out how this was irrelevant, that's like complaining NWN doesn't completely model pnp as far as monsters go. It's a videogame. <br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, another user showed a vid of them defeating a dragon in a later chapter of the module but they removed the +12 cap on boosting ability scores through spells/items. They justified it by saying it was an option in EE. Another user pointed out the module wasn't designed with that feature in mind, similar levels of butthurt ensued. <br/>\n<br/>\nImo, this module isn't just combat and has many rping opportunities and I didn't feel like having a powerful build affected that aspect at all. <br/>\n<br/>\nI could see in a PW with other players, someone who is not focusing on rping while others are would be bad form.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the butthurt was more that I explained if you thought the module was unfair, you don't known NWN well enough. I suppose they took that as a personal attack which it was not intended to be.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Apart from anything else, you wouldn't be able to go back to the same module twice, because if you did you would be forced not to prepare yourself for that dragon you know is over the hill you're approaching having been fried by it the first time, thus ending up as an omelette again, and again, and again (admittedly my cooking metaphor might have slid from the skillet somewhat). So you'd either have to get everything right the first time or resign yourself to never finishing the module.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, you well know that I'm not a \"true\" power gamer myself, endeavoring to squeeze every drop of xp and hit the level 40 hot spot asap. Rather, I tend more to builds that play well throughout their levels and immerse themselves in the various plots and sub-plots. Now, the second part of that is absolutely \"proper\" role play, whereas the first bit is probably more like self-gimping. Which is grand for me, but may well irk others. Give yourself your own parameters, then build the best PC you can within those margins.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the great things about NwN (and indeed D&amp;D more broadly) is that one is, as you rightly say, able to enjoy playing your own way (unless you have a singularly crappy DM, ofc). Why even bother, otherwise?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
