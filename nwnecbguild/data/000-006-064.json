Unlike other casters, Druids don\u2019t get the Haste spell (which is kind of essential for a mage, as it doubles your output). The amount of sacrifice you need to make to mimic it without spending 1/6th of your time chugging potions is very large, unless you are willing to play with a low caster level and a low spell penetration. This build achieves the maximum possible CL and SR constrained on having AQ3, 38 Wisdom, and ESF:Conjuration. The class spread cannot be touched at all to reach that, and there is no room for Dragon Shape (which would not benefit from being a Monk anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything else can be changed according to preference: I choose Scribe Scroll and Maximize Spell as my two extra feats, as I find that the Druid spellbook is well suited to be Maxed. Scrolls I find vital: for those who don\u2019t know, casting a spell from a scroll takes a full round, unless the caster is hasted (or quickened) and the scroll is cast as the second spell. In other words, with Haste on (or AQ), you can cast a spell from your spellbook and then a spell from a scroll every round, effectively doubling your slots. You have plenty of skillpoints to allocate as you like, and even starting stats can be customised at will.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo play as a caster, you need to survive in order to be able to cast your spells. Since you have no AC, you need summons and your companion to tank for you. This will not necessarily work in epic levels in vanilla NWN, but works alright in environments such as WoG where both have been buffed. Use Defensive Casting Mode to avoid attacks if you have to come in close (for eg Harm), and your crowd control spells to keep enemies at bay.\u00a0And pray you don\u2019t find a perma-Haste item, or all your sacrifices will be in vain and you\u2019ll want to hit yourself in the head.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, not as strong a build as\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/heirophant-of-the-cabal-druid-37-cot2-monk1-t2355778.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the Hierophant of the Cabal</a>\u00a0or <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-skilled-and-sneaky-draconian-arch-druid-ssd-dr-t2355112.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the SSD Arch-Druid</a>, and lacking Monk AC, Evasion, and Dragon Shape. Seriously, if you want to play a caster Druid, choose one of those. If you want to give it AQ3, which is nice, just drop some GWIS and accept the loss of 2 spell DC.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You only need the Ranger level to get absolute maximum spell DC while retaining a high caster level.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
