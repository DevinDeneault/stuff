For some reason, I'm still unable to make an appropriate link, but it's build 110 in the ECB Guild's database of builds - the ECB Guild Filter, available via a link in the Rules and Tools sub-forum. Admittedly, it's a level 40 build, but it does have both Terrifying Rage and Epic Dodge. It's also a dual-wielder (kukris), so if you'd prefer to single wield in melee you've got feats available for focus/etc in slings. Might be worth a look.<br/>\n<br/>\n In any case, good to have you on board!<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Secondly, your stealth will useless against True Seers so you'll need to run in fast and attempt an IKD and hope it lands else you will die vs. all mages and clerics, maybe even caster druids... all of which will have a far more deadly ranged attack than your sling.\u00a0 Third, in order to have the best chance to KD you can do without the DW AB penalty.\u00a0 Figure on very high AC counters in PvP.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, a PBS slinger under a cloud of Darkness will not suffer AoOs which pretty much neutralizes any benefit of a melee switch.\u00a0 Same shield gets used in either case so no AC boost.\u00a0 But I've laid it all out in a sample build regardless so you can examine how many feats may be getting wasted by arranging a melee switch.\u00a0 You also lose the +AB PBS bonus with a blade.\u00a0 <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you care not about XP penalty, you can use Ftr instead of CoT and grab the specialization for damage but suffer the loss in saves which are pretty lame without CoT thrown into the mix.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, ImpCrit for the alternate focus is not really necessary either since the attack won't be used for damage but rather for KD vs. spellcasters (and for avoiding AoOs vs. flanking mobs, if you consider PvM). <br/>\n<br/>\nIMO, rather than using stealth I'd be investing in traps but that depends on whether the server has ample opportunities for recovering or crafting traps.\u00a0 You <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">could</span> set traps with detection DCs too high for any class other than a rogue to spot.\u00a0 But that's a whole other consideration...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, something to compare with your own ideas...<br/>\n<br/>\nA Rogue 14/ Barbarian 16/ Champion of Torm(10), Any non-lawful non-evil Halfling<br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 12<br/>\nDEX: 19 (32)<br/>\nCON: 12*<br/>\nWIS: 8*<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 8*<br/>\n<br/>\n* a spare starting ability point should be added to one of these abilities with no effect on the build.<br/>\n<br/>\n01 - Rog(1): Blind Fight<br/>\n02 - Brb(1)<br/>\n03 - Brb(2): Wpn Finesse<br/>\n04 - Brb(3): DEX+1 (20)<br/>\n05 - Brb(4)<br/>\n06 - Brb(5): WF: tiny/small finessable<br/>\n07 - Brb(6)<br/>\n08 - Rog(2): DEX+1 (21)<br/>\n09 - CoT(1): WF: Sling<br/>\n10 - CoT(2): PBS<br/>\n12 - CoT(4): DEX+1 (22), ImpCrit: Sling, Rapid Shot<br/>\n13 - Rog(3)<br/>\n14 - CoT(5)<br/>\n15 - CoT(6): ImpCrit: tiny/small finessable, KD<br/>\n16 - CoT(7): DEX+1 (23)<br/>\n17 - CoT(8): Dodge<br/>\n18 - Rog(4): IKD<br/>\n20 - Brb(8): DEX+1 (24)<br/>\n21 - Brb(9): EWF: Sling<br/>\n22 - Brb(10)<br/>\n23 - Brb(11)<br/>\n24 - Brb(12): DEX+1 (25), EWF: tiny/small finessable<br/>\n25 - Rog(5)<br/>\n26 - Rog(6)<br/>\n27 - Rog(7): Grt DEX (26)<br/>\n28 - Rog(8): DEX+1 (27)<br/>\n29 - Rog(9)<br/>\n30 - Rog(10): Grt DEX (28), Def Roll<br/>\n31 - Rog(11)<br/>\n32 - Rog(12): DEX+1 (29)<br/>\n33 - Rog(13): Epic Dodge, ImpEvasion<br/>\n34 - Brb(13)<br/>\n35 - Brb(14)<br/>\n36 - Brb(15): DEX+1 (30), Terrifying Rage<br/>\n37 - CoT(9)<br/>\n38 - CoT(10): Epic Prowess (or Armor Skin)<br/>\n39 - Rog(14): Grt DEX (31)<br/>\n40 - Brb(16): DEX+1 (32)<br/>\n<br/>\nHP max: 416<br/>\nSaves F/W/R (vs spells): 30/20/39 (34/24/43)<br/>\nAdd'l saves: Traps +7, Fear +2<br/>\nBAB: 29 (4 APR, 5 APR RS mode)<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 45 (mundane tiny/small finessable), 46 (+1 PBS) (mundane sling)\u00a0 [-1 w/AS]<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane fplate+lgshield): 30/31 (+1 Dodge) [+2 w/AS]<br/>\n<br/>\nSkills (263) - Hide 42(57), Intimidate 43(42), Move Silently 42(59), Spellcraft 18(20), Taunt 43(42), Tumble 40(51), UMD 34(33), fun skills ------&gt;

4<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see, forcing both TR and ED into such a limited build eliminates some advantages like extended crit range for both weapons and EWF for the melee switch.\u00a0 AB is significantly reduced without access to Grt DEX boosts in epic.\u00a0 Also, last taunt dump is too early to become a factor vs. maxed Conc foes though one detection skill could conceivably be sacrificed to reach as high as possible skill level, 26.\u00a0\u00a0 <br/>\n<br/>\nThe general lesson to be learned is that without many more CoT (or Ftr... w/XP penalty) levels, developing proficiency in two weapon types is impossible and the end result is a compromise between the two... not a desirable situation for PvP where the builds have been optimized to counter the weaker attack and AC.\u00a0 But this is about as close to what you requested as you'll get so good luck with your plan.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>edit:\u00a0 added level 30 example and clarified the previous build in a few places</em><br/>\n\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
