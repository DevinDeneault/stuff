      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Apologies if this has been done before. I wanted to see how a non-fighter WM would work out. Non-Fighter or CoT Weapon Masters are traditionally feat-starved, and this one is no different. Ranger lets me squeeze in a lot of utility as well as improved two weapon fighting and 3 favoured enemies to make up for a little of the lost damage (I chose generally crit-immune enemies, pick favoured enemies you know will be wherever you are playing).<br/>\nThere is one feat that could be changed, and that's Blind Fight at level 18. I suggest some alternatives below but I like that due to its synergy with listen, which is a class skill for all of your classes. Skills are quite flexible, you could put points into open lock, search and disarm trap if you wanted to but they'd be cross-class so I decided against it. If the environment has items with good boosts to those skills, it might be worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAB is good, damage is decent but saves and HP are mediocre. Not having any 1 strong save means the build gets more mileage out of +uni saves items, but will fail a lot against everything without them. Against casters, you will probably be forced to abuse HiPS with your less-than-stellar stealth skills and hope for crits. You have access to Camouflage and Cat's Grace to help your hide, and potential access to One With The Land if you can find either a spellslot item or +2 wisdom. You'll probably be abusing HiPS a lot due to the build's low AC and lack of knockdown.<br/>\n<br/>\nPros:<br/>\n- Good AB<br/>\n- Decent damage<br/>\n- Decent Stealth Skills and HiPS<br/>\n- Evasion / Uncanny Dodge<br/>\n- WM Stuff, x4 crits<br/>\n- Scales well with magic level<br/>\n<br/>\nCons:<br/>\n- Low saves<br/>\n- Low AC<br/>\n- Mediocre HP<br/>\n- Crit immune enemies are a pain<br/>\n- Weak to Casters<br/>\n- HiPS but no sneak attacks<br/>\n- Feat-starved<br/>\n- Lack of lock/trap skills<br/>\nRanger (10) Weapon Master (7) Shadow Dancer (3)<br/>\nHuman<br/>\nAlignment: Any\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nPvM 1-20<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 17 (22)<br/>\nDEX: 13<br/>\nCON: 10<br/>\nWIS: 12<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Ranger(1): Dodge, Mobility, Favoured Enemy: Undead<br/>\n02: Ranger(2)<br/>\n03: Ranger(3): Weapon Focus: Handaxe<br/>\n04: Ranger(4): STR+1 (STR=18)<br/>\n05: Ranger(5): Favoured Enemy: Constructs<br/>\n06: Ranger(6): Expertise<br/>\n07: Ranger(7)<br/>\n08: Shadowdancer(1): STR+1 (STR= 19)<br/>\n09: Ranger(8): Spring Attack<br/>\n10: Ranger(9)<br/>\n11: Ranger(10): Favoured Enemy: Elementals<br/>\n12: Shadowdancer (2): STR +1(STR=20) Whirlwind Attack<br/>\n13: Weapon Master(1): Weapon of Choice: Handaxe<br/>\n14: Weapon Master(2)<br/>\n15: Weapon Master(3): Improved Critical: Handaxe<br/>\n16: Weapon Master(4): STR+1 (STR=21)<br/>\n17: Weapon Master(5)\u00a0<br/>\n18: Weapon Master(6): Blind Fight*<br/>\n19: Weapon Master(7)<br/>\n20: Shadowdancer(3): STR+1 (STR=22)<br/>\n* You could change Blind Fight for Knockdown, Toughness, Improved Expertise or something else of your choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 194<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 10/12/7 (+1 vs spells)<br/>\nBAB: 19<br/>\n<br/>\nDual Wielding:<br/>\nAB (mundane handaxe x2): +25/+20/+15/+10 +25/+20<br/>\nAC (mundane studded leather / self cat's grace) 18/21<br/>\n<br/>\nSword 'n' Board<br/>\nAB (mundane handaxe): +27/22/17/12<br/>\nAC (mundane chainmail + tower shield / + self cat's grace): 23/24<br/>\n<br/>\nSkillpoints: 132<br/>\nDiscipline(22), Hide(23), Move Silently(23), Tumble(20), Listen(23), Intimidate(4), Spellcraft(4)<br/>\n01: Discipline(4), Hide(4), Move Silently(4), Listen(1),\u00a0<br/>\n02: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Listen(1),\u00a0<br/>\n03: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Listen(1),\u00a0<br/>\n04: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Listen(1),\u00a0<br/>\n05: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Intimidate (4), Listen(1),\u00a0<br/>\n06: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Listen(1),\u00a0<br/>\n07: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble (5), Listen(1),\u00a0<br/>\n08: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble (5), Listen(1),\u00a0<br/>\n09: Discipline(2), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Listen(1),\u00a0<br/>\n10: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Listen(1),\u00a0<br/>\n11: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Listen(1),\u00a0<br/>\n12: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble (5), Listen(1),\u00a0<br/>\n13: Discipline(2), Listen(1),\u00a0<br/>\n14: Discipline(1), Listen(1),\u00a0<br/>\n15: Discipline(1), Listen(1),\u00a0<br/>\n16: Discipline(1), Listen(1),\u00a0<br/>\n17: Discipline(1), Listen(1),<br/>\n18: Discipline(1), Listen(1),\u00a0<br/>\n19: Discipline(1), Listen(1),\u00a0<br/>\n20: Hide(8), Move Silently (8), Tumble(5), Listen (1), Spellcraft(4),\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the skills work out correctly.

You take Ranger to fulfill the skill requirements for SD, which happens to share the same requirements as WM. Kudos for the originality! That said, I have built non-Fighter or CoT WMs, but at level 40, which gives you some room for taking some important feats in epics. Dont get me wrong, I like what you did with the build, but I don't like the original concept, nor would I enjoy playing it. The reason for it is that this build has no tools except HiPS. no KD to disable enemies, no UMD to buff itself, and even the AB isn't that impressive because it's a level 20 build, so the ESWF from Epic WM isn't a factor. It's basically a left-clicker that can hide when he gets in trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo suggest an improvement, I'd take Expertise and WF at 1, Dodge at 3, and then the remaining requirements just after. I'd also be be inclined to take SD 2 right after SD 1 to get Evasion ASAP. I'm aware you'll lose a skill dump for Tumble, but you can abuse HiPS and just not worry about it too much. The last SD level rounds out the build nicely, and if you wanted, you could take it at 17, but then you'd delay the WM goodies for 1 level.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hello and welcome to the guild Edd!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough building weaponmasters with fighter is much easier and in general also gives stronger builds, I like your daring attempt to build something different and adding other qualities. The build has it's strengths and weaknesses, but works well if you are careful and know how to play it.<br/>\nThe AB is high, there are many attacks per round and you have strong crits to boost the fairly high strength and FE based damage.<br/>\nYou are right that the build becomes feat starved without fighter. But here you have the synergy between SD and WM, both needing Dodge and Mobility to help you out. I agree with you taking Blind fight and that knockdown and other feats are optional.<br/>\nYou seem to have mixed up the order of the saves bonuses. They should be: Fort 10, will 7, Refl 12.<br/>\nWhen I count the skills I find that this build has 153 skill points. You cross class 4 Intimidate, 5 Tumble and 4 Spellcraft, so 13 skilll points \"disappear\" that way. But you still have many skill points to play with yet. As for skills, I would take either Spellcraft 3 or 8 for 5 or 10 modified ranks because the bonus to saves comes at every 5 modified rank.<br/>\nYour AC calculations are right, but there are in fact two options to get one more AC. If you can buff and add dex items to bring the dex to 22, you will have AC 22 in leather armor for dual wielding. And if you can buff your dex to 18 you will have AC 22 in chain shirt or AC 25 in chain shirt and tower.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Max, this build is more than a  \"left clicker\".<br/>\nThe build is indeed feat starved compared with a fighter build, but you can play well with what you have here.<br/>\nTaking KD is an option. You already have expertise for tanking. WW attack is also there for special occasions. <br/>\nStealth offers tactical positioning. HIPS can be used both offensively and defensively. <br/>\nSD also offers Shadow evade and Shadow daze as a minor bonus.<br/>\nAs I pointed out, you also have more skill points to use here, eg. for trap skills.<br/>\nAnd since this is a lvl 20 build, you can swap weapons to adapt to different situations and only lose 1AB. <br/>\nYou also have an animal companion and a shadow that can serve as distraction.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

HiPS is a nice pause button and allows for repositioning to attack priority targets like casters, but otherwise doesn't offer nearly the same amount of potential it does in sneak attack builds.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can swap around levels to get evasion and uncanny dodge earlier if you wish, I prioritised HiPS -&gt; ITWF -&gt; Evasion because dead casters deal 0 damage, but if you wanted to you could swap it earlier. You can make the choice during levelling based on what you're facing, the 2nd SD level can be taken at any point between 9-12 if you decide you need those bonuses. I prefer keeping SD 3 for level 20 for maxing hide and MS, since the mediocre DEX means the build is not that hard to spot. You could swap it to level 19, but I wouldn't go before then because it's your final hide/MS dump and stealth is your main (only) defense.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a higher amount of skill points, I'd propose:<br/>\nDiscipline(22), Hide(23), Move Silently(23), Tumble(20), Listen(23), Intimidate(4), Spellcraft(3) and add in:<br/>\n<br/>\n23 Heal - kits can be used while stealthed.<br/>\n23 Search - know what's about to kill you even though you don't have the skills to do anything about it<br/>\n14 Set Trap / 9 Heal - would allow setting deadly traps.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think?

The only way I see it with that skill distribution is to buy them at a merchant. You can't craft them, recover them, or detect them, so that'd be a problem. But if they are for sale where you play, then absolutlety. Otherwise I'd suggest Set Trap 14 / Craft Trap 9. At least that way you can craft them.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
