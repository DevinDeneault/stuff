      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">That's a lot of questions Dzmitry. <br/>\nAA is by far the most OP archer class and enables many of the different build types that you list above. <br/>\nSome of them are not really any good without the boost to AB and/or damage from the AA class. <br/>\n<br/>\nTactical options, versatility and a sound defense make the best solo archers. Typical glass cannon builds work better in parties. <br/>\n<br/>\nI will not point at any build in particular \u00a0because what works for me doesn't necessarily work for you. That has to do with preferred play style and the module design where you play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have made a guide for archers with focus on the AA class where I describe these things more in depth.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
