There is no time stop &amp; no devastating critical, but you'll be able to empower your spells for 1 level only, making empowered horrid wilting as a 9th-level spell through a prestige class. There is an emphasis on many attacks, you can get as many as 17 attacks/round with kamas &amp; perfect two-weapon fighting. There are additional spells like enlarge &amp; mirror image that everyone uses &amp; combined with the lack of TS, favors spell-swords a lot. Barbarians are better than NWN1 &amp; they also have a prestige class named frenzy berserker that <strong>quintuples </strong>their power attack damage. You can set your PA or IE and they <strong>stay</strong> that way until you de-activate them yourself (a nice quality-of-life improvement). <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some good epic spells like vampiric feast &amp; mass fowl and many more interesting feats that you can select but there are fewer levels to fit them into. Haste does not make you cast two spells/round, you will have to take the epic feats for that, but it is an epic-waste because it only quickens up to 3rd-level spells. So, mages are a lot slower to counter with spells, which favors, once-again, spell-swords that can do anything. The combat animations are weird...some good, some not so good. There are a lot of prestige classes to take &amp; they are interesting but you cannot extend them to epic levels... Heal/harm is up to 150 hit points (thankfully). Knockdown is nerfed but disarm is boosted. You can have up to four classes but only up to thirty levels to fit them in. All levels count as BAB, even epic ones. The basic, average Joe fighter is a fine build (proven in battlegrounds) to take. There are sub-races too and the graphics and music are nice-ish, at least the character models have more polygons, I guess. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some good modules to play on NWN2 but nothing in the scale of Aielund, I'm afraid. Still a lot of good, free content though. <br/>\nShould you buy it? I mean, no matter the changes, there are still 100's of hours of gameplay to be had in the game...for $10-15, sure!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
