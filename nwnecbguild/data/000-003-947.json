      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">1) PvM or PvP:<br/>\nFocused on PVP but if it can kill a dragon or two solo it would be nice of course.<br/>\nNo rp on this server so all xp comes from hitting things.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Level cap:<br/>\nMax level is 30, softcap is 16 cause after that you get like 2xp per kill.<br/>\nSo aiming for strong at 15 would be good and then every extra level would just be an extra bonus.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Race preference:<br/>\nDwarf or human preferably.<br/>\nIn worst case half-orc or elf.<br/>\nAs said, looking for massive cheese on a pure pvp server.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Class preference:<br/>\nAnything goes really. Honest.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Melee preference:<br/>\nIf melee, the highest damage and survival potential.<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Range preference:<br/>\nServer seems to lag quite often so not sure if this is wise.<br/>\nBut anything powerful goes.<br/>\n<br/>\n7) Weapon preference:<br/>\nAnything that combined survivability with high dps.<br/>\nBastardsword with tower shield maybe? Scythe? 2h sword?<br/>\n<br/>\n8) Maximum item enhancement: <br/>\n+3 attributes gear exist. Most people use greater weapon buff +5 rather than upgrading their weapons in damage. There is life steal, elemental damage, haste, stoneskin &amp; invisibility. But most are charged spells that you can use x times per day and they count your casterlevel towards effectiveness.<br/>\n<br/>\n9) Spellcasting:<br/>\nWizards are heavily nerfed so they tend to do buffs and fight melee, damage has been lowered and you need onetime use items to cast.<br/>\nClerics are offlimits unless you're a member of their game group.<br/>\n<br/>\n10) Custom factors:<br/>\n- The first three levels have to be the same class.<br/>\n- No cleric, paladin or druid.<br/>\n- If monk then it has to start there and when switches to another class it locks out monk advancement forever.<br/>\n- Exotic style weaponry to fit in with my toon. Scythe, doubleblade/mace/axe, katanas and so forth would be nice but aiming for cheese so whatever really.<br/>\n- Any mix of rogue, mage, ranger, fighter &amp; barbarian allowed.<br/>\n- Prestige classes assassin, shadowdancer &amp; weaponmaster are free to use. Most others have limitations.<br/>\n- You can rest 1 time per 30 minutes, so healing is hard and getting back x amount skills/spells is hard.<br/>\n- Getting killed by a player makes you lose a level, no matter what level you're at. So survival is nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeyond that, massive dps &amp; selfsufficient &amp; destroyer of worlds preferably.<br/>\n<br/>\nMainly wanting to prove that said server can still face strong builds even when most classes are locked behind a paywall.

Hello!<br/>\n<br/>\nOddly enough, my first proper build here was a Dwarven Defender 23/ Fighter 10/ Weapon Master 7. His stats were Str 17 (rising to 34), Dex 13, Con 16, Wis 8, Int 14, Cha 6. The thread is Grim Stonefoot, and you can find him in Hip's ECB Guild Filter if you fancy a look. There are things I'd do differently these days, but he still holds a place in my heart.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

In my simple world.<br/>\nBut I would probably have mixed it as this is a lvl 30 max server. So 10 fighter, mixed dd / wm.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
