      "content": "<div>This one is about natural/ creature weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I know with Dragon Shape, Weapon Focus: Unarmed and its Epic counterpart doesn't work, but Improved Critical: Unarmed does. So the first part of this should be simple enough. Does the same hold true for all druid shapes?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second part is to ask whether there is merit in taking Unarmed Fighting and its Improved version (to avoid AoOs when attacking in animal form)?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it wouldn't matter if I were taking even 1 level of Monk, but it ain't allowed with Barbarian. And the character I'm working on is definitely a Barb (it would be so much easier if he were a Fighter, but you play what you're dealt, right?). Also, he will only be using Wildshape: Dire Bear and Dire Wolf from his Druid levels. My current thinking is a Druid 18 (he is never seen casting spells, so undispellabilty and some of the meta magic feats won't really be needed)/ Barbarian 16 (for Terrifying Rage)/ CoT 6 (for 3 bonus feats and +3 to saves), but that may change.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again!</div>",
