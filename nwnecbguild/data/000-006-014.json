      "content": "<div>This is a Battle Cleric with Devastating Critical.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have seached the old and new archives after a similar build. In the old archives there are few strength builds with this class combination and none that have Dev crit. With our new ECB filter (beta) there came up four builds with cleric and Dev crit: We have the Blade Juggernaut and Chaos Harbinger from the Legacy builds. Then we have Orion's <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/unholy-hurricane-of-death-c-13-m-2-bg-25-10-attks--t2355065.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Unholy Hurricane of Death</a>. The build that structurally is closest to mine is Mithdradates' <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/hierophant-of-velsharoon-cleric-26-bard-4-palemast-t2354621.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hierophant of Velsharoon\u00a0</a> even if it is a bard/PM build and as such has other qualities. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Devastator priest is built as a combat cleric with focus on reaching an undispellable level without too much delay. Monk adds class skills, better saves, Evasion and Cleave as a bonus feat. CoT gives the Martial proficiency, improves the saves and adds much needed feats. A high Fortitude save protects in a Dev crit environment. I have focused on maintaining BAB+15 at level 20 for full effect of Divine pover. AB will not be a problem with clerics anyway since they can buff to the cap. As for domains, I chose Trickery and Travel. Trickery is there for access to the Improved invisibility spell with 50% concealment. Feel free to choose something else than Travel if there are perma-haste items available. The skill points in Heal are not essential for the build idea, so put them where you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nPros: Power, <span style=\"font-size:100%;line-height:normal\">POWER,</span> <span style=\"font-size:150%;line-height:normal\">POWER, <span style=\"font-size:175%;line-height:normal\">POWER</span></span><br/>\nCons: If you think Cleric with Dev Crit is too overpowered.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCleric(26), Monk(4), Champion of Torm(10), Human<br/>\nAlignment: LG, LN<br/>\nBest in mid- and low magic environments<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 16 (30)<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 12<br/>\nWIS: 16 (20)<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Cleric(1): Knockdown, Extend Spell, Domain Trickery, Domain Travel<br/>\n02: Cleric(2): <br/>\n03: Cleric(3): Weapon Focus: Morning Star<br/>\n04: Cleric(4): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n05: Cleric(5)<br/>\n06: Cleric(6): Blind Fight<br/>\n07: Monk(1): {Cleave, Evasion}<br/>\n08: Cleric(7): STR+1, (STR=18)<br/>\n09: Cleric(8): Empower Spell<br/>\n10: Cleric(9)<br/>\n11: Cleric(10)<br/>\n12: Champion of Torm(1): WIS+1, Weapon Focus: Scimitar, (WIS=17)<br/>\n13: Cleric(11)<br/>\n14: Cleric(12)<br/>\n15: Cleric(13): Improved Critical: Scimitar<br/>\n16: Cleric(14): WIS+1, (WIS=18)<br/>\n17: Monk(2):<br/>\n18: Cleric(15): Power Attack<br/>\n19: Cleric(16)<br/>\n20: Champion of Torm(2): WIS+1, Great Cleave, (WIS=19)<br/>\n21: Cleric(17): Great Strength I, (STR=19)<br/>\n22: Cleric(18)<br/>\n23: Cleric(19)<br/>\n24: Cleric(20): STR+1, Great Strength II, (STR=21)<br/>\n25: Cleric(21)<br/>\n26: Cleric(22)<br/>\n27: Monk(3): Great Strength III, (STR=22)<br/>\n28: Cleric(23): STR+1, Armor Skin, (STR=23)<br/>\n29: Cleric(24)<br/>\n30: Champion of Torm(3): Great Strength IV, {Smite Evil}, (STR=24)<br/>\n31: Champion of Torm(4): Overwhelming Critical: Scimitar<br/>\n32: Champion of Torm(5): STR+1, (STR=25)<br/>\n33: Champion of Torm(6): Great Strength V, Devastating Critical: Scimitar, (STR=26)<br/>\n34: Champion of Torm(7)<br/>\n35: Champion of Torm(8): Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br/>\n36: Champion of Torm(9): STR+1, Great Strength VI, (STR=28)<br/>\n37: Monk(4)<br/>\n38: Cleric(25)<br/>\n39: Champion of Torm(10): Great Strength VII, Epic Prowess, (STR=29)<br/>\n40: Cleric(26): STR+1, Great Wisdom I, (STR=30), (WIS=20)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 380<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 32/33/25<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9, Mind Effects: +2<br/>\nBAB: 25<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 39 (melee), 25 (ranged)<br/>\nDev crit DC: 40<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 24/30<br/>\nSpell Casting: Cleric(9)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nSkillpoints: 223<br/>\nConcentration 43(44), Discipline 42(52), Heal 15(20), Listen 40(45), Spellcraft 43(45), Tumble 40(39)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Concentration(4), Heal(4), Spellcraft(3), Save(9), <br/>\n02: Concentration(1), Save(13), <br/>\n03: Concentration(1), Save(17), <br/>\n04: Concentration(1), Save(21), <br/>\n05: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5), Save(20), <br/>\n06: Concentration(1), Save(24), <br/>\n07: Concentration(1), Discipline(10), Listen(10), Tumble(10), <br/>\n08: Concentration(1), Heal(2), Save(2), <br/>\n09: Concentration(1), Save(6), <br/>\n10: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5), Save(5), <br/>\n11: Concentration(1), Save(9), <br/>\n12: Discipline(5), Save(9), <br/>\n13: Concentration(2), Save(12), <br/>\n14: Concentration(1), Save(16), <br/>\n15: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5), Save(15), <br/>\n16: Concentration(1), Save(19), <br/>\n17: Concentration(1), Discipline(5), Listen(10), Tumble(10), <br/>\n18: Concentration(1), Heal(2), Save(2), <br/>\n19: Concentration(1), Save(6), <br/>\n20: Discipline(3), Save(8), <br/>\n21: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(5), Save(6), <br/>\n22: Concentration(1), Save(10), <br/>\n23: Concentration(1), Save(14), <br/>\n24: Concentration(1), Save(18), <br/>\n25: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5), Save(17), <br/>\n26: Concentration(1), Save(21), <br/>\n27: Concentration(1), Discipline(7), Listen(10), Tumble(10), <br/>\n28: Concentration(1), Heal(4), <br/>\n29: Concentration(1), Heal(2), Save(2), <br/>\n30: Discipline(3), Save(4), <br/>\n31: Discipline(1), Save(8), <br/>\n32: Discipline(1), Save(12), <br/>\n33: Discipline(1), Save(16), <br/>\n34: Discipline(1), Save(20), <br/>\n35: Discipline(1), Save(24), <br/>\n36: Discipline(1), Save(28), <br/>\n37: Concentration(8), Discipline(1), Listen(10), Tumble(10), Save(6), <br/>\n38: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(10), <br/>\n39: Discipline(2), Heal(1), Save(2), <br/>\n40: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(5),</div>",

(Iirc, there was another one of yours around the same time who also got moved. Though, to be fair, I think Hip finally snapped after filling in schedules for many, many other builds in short order when pulling the Filter together. I'd have just moved them, but he's nicer than me.)<br/>\nBlack Cobra is, of course, still more than welcome to post his build - I tried nudging him once already.

Taking Plant for the reason is good idea, as the lvl 5 and 6 spells are overcrowded with goodies anyway, so it left you with very little room for haste, imo way more practical was to have barkskin at lvl 2.<br/>\nSummons play very important role when solo so yeah Animal domain all the way and cats grace +2AC (or more if empowered)\u00a0<br/>\nInstead of Extended spell at first lvl (why??) i chose expertise. In total, with spells, expertise and standard gear can get to 33AC from the very early levels, which is quite good i think.\u00a0 This is of course entirely for WoG, from my very limited experience. Lawful neutral, Obad-Hai.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\nHappy Christmas (or whatever left from it :P).\u00a0</div></blockquote>\nThis is good feedback from early leveling on WoG. AC is important there and starting out with dex 8 may pose a challenge early on before you get dex gear and the AC buffs start to kick in.\u00a0<br/>\nExpertise is a good feat for temporary AC. The question is if you really need it as a cleric later in the game.<br/>\nYou ask why Extend spell at lvl 1? Extend is there for the 1 round per level spells and for Divine Favor to last 2 turns rather than only 1. It comes at lvl 1 because none of the other feats are available or better to take that early.<br/>\nThe build was not tailored to any specific module or PW. Like most generic builds you can tweak it to fit the environment where you play.<br/>\nI look forward to hearing how it performs on WoG at higher levels.</div>",

      "content": "<div>Fair enough, I was considering making the change as a derivative.  Upon closer examination I can keep the Great Wisdom and net Improved Knockdown at no feat cost.  This is accomplished by dropping level 1 knockdown, pulling Great Cleave into the sub 20 feat schedule and pushing the second CoT level to level 21 to preserve the suggested Great Wisdom loss.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe net result is the non-trivial QoL cost of trading the existing level 1 knockdown for level 37 improved knockdown, Immune Disease, 1 AC at level 5 and of course the +10% speed bonus.  A cost I am willing to accept but probably is not the best generic build choice, unless the goal is strongest level 40 build mechanically or you are on a server with Knockdown items.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless, thanks for the feedback and thanks for the build, I find it very interesting and will give it a, slightly modified, twirl and let you know how it fares.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>"

Monk levels are for Cleave, Evasion, and skill dumps for tumble. A morningstar weapon is quite decent for a cleric early on. After COT levels, choose any weapon you like, it doesn't matter. I have chosen the longsword because I like it, and there are typically a lot of good longswords available in most modules, not just in OC or HOTU. Regarding charisma, it is low, so we come to the conclusion that you can't have everything naturally. But at least a 14 INT score gives you more skills, so you can pump diplomacy or other social skill on every level, which will help you.\u00a0</div>"

You'll probably finish HotU at around level 28, so you'll need a few more levels for the feat, and SoF goes all the way to level 40.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, this build works very well even before taking Dev Crit.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Oh, and taking morning star early is also helpful against undead (blunt weapons work best against them, by and large), and you'll meet a lot of them at early levels in the OC.</div>",
