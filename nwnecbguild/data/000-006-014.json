      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hail, might ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\n A long time ago in a galaxy far far away, Mick Dagger posted his great build <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/spellsword-of-bahamut-sorc-26-paladin-4-rdd-10-t515415.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Spellsword of Bahamut</a>, and he and I had a chat about the possibility of switching Paladin for Bard levels or of taking DM/DS in that build. In the end he suggested I should try to create the ECB's first Sorcerer / Bard / RDD. Believe me when I say: I TRIED!!! There was something unforeseen by me when I took him up on that, which was that the reason for taking Bard over Paladin was the skillset, but for the most part, you take levels on classes that don't give you many skill points, so there just weren't enough skill points for Concentration, Discipline, Tumble, Taunt, UMD and Spellcraft, all of which are considered a MUST in this build idea. After having reached that conclusion, this idea was thrown into the limbo of my Unfinished Builds folder, where it has remained until now.<br/>\n<br/>\n Lately I have begun playing Wizards more deeply, both as a support class and as a dedicated caster, so I decided to take a look at all my builds in the Unfinished folder to see if this new experience would give me a fresher look into builds involving Arcane casters. Then it hit me: Wizards cast with INT, which is the ability that modifies skillpoints per level, they have bonus feats to take metamagic feats AND they have a more flexible spellbook than the Sorcerer, which is better if you don't want to be a Timestopping IGMSer. I went ahead and looked at the old guild's archive to try to find any builds with that spread and I found only 2 builds with this class combo:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build255990.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Might &amp; Magic by dmuzzy</a> and <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build236961.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Spellfire, a max INT wizard by FinneousPJ</a><br/>\n<br/>\n Neither of those builds were optimized according to my standards. The first is a str-and-int-based spellsword who goes for 12 Wizard pre-epic, losing BAB and also doesn't have Autostill feats or epic spells (namely EMA), which are a core part of a plate-wearing arcane caster's gear IMO. The second one stops RDD at 9 and goes for INT, so, although the idea is nice, I would never do it that way. In my view, if you go for a melee-focus, you need to take as many Wizard levels in EPICS as possible to build BAB, and if you go for INT, you don't take RDD levels, you take PM, for example, critical hit immunity and more AC is better than STR bonuses.<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, I went to work and started rebuilding my former Sorcerer / Bard / RDD as a Wizard / Bard / RDD and came up with this guy. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mick Dagger for inspiring the original thought and causing the chain of events which led to me devise this build. Mick, I concede the point to you, you were right: Paladin is better than Bard in that Sorcerer build of yours (but I'd still take the Divine feats LOL). If you wanna go for Bard, to take advantage of the skillset, you should swap Sorcerer for Wizard for the INT increase and the bonus feats.<br/>\n<br/>\n This guy is a very flexible spellsword with not such a bad AB as one would think with 39 unbuffed, and a very good AC. He can cast in Full Plate, has Expertise and Taunt for the combo EMA and EW, Concentration, Discipline, Tumble, UMD to take advantage of the full Bard skillset and 18 CON, which is great for a Wizard with a d4 HD. You can drop IKD for Improved Critical if you want, but I decided against it because I prefer IKD. I tried to take RDD 10 ASAP to have the most skill points I could have. In the end it was very wise to do so, as I only had 1 leftover skillpoint! You're not a very good listener until lvl 40, but you have True Seeing for that! I am very pleased with the result.<br/>\n<br/>\n Ladies and Gentlemen: the Draconic Arcanist!<br/>\n<br/>\n Illusionist(26), Bard(4), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Human<br/>\n<br/>\n Alignment: Any

Then you can equip an armor of Might to be able to cap STR as well as INT, while being gear-flexible enough to adapt to most situations. A belt of Slashing Resistance or Piercing Resistance can be equipped if necessary to complement DR spells. Also, that makes it so that if you want to have high AC, you cast EMA, if you don't then you will be able to make full use of damage shields <br/>\n<br/>\nOn WoG, Tenser's Transformation has been modified not to change your gear when you cast it. However, 100% spell failure is still an issue. You still get +13 AB, which coupled with GMW can nearly cap your AB. And the fact that you still have your gear means your STR boni are still good to go. Even if with default Tenser's, this build will be GREAT, you get +16 AB (+13 from Tenser's at lvl 26 and +3 from the Longsword you get as a weapon), while having nearly full AC due to EMA still applying.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the calculations, I could provide them now, if you wish. I haven't tested him yet, not without gear anyway, cuz I don't play in low-magic servers, but let that not be a problem:<br/>\n<br/>\nAB = 39 + 1-3 from Empowered Bull's + 20 from True Strike = 60-62 with Taunt debuff it can reach 66-68 on its own for 9 seconds. Add a scroll of Aura of Vitality for another +2 to AB.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the time, however, you will have 39 + 1-3 from Empowered Bull's Strength +5 GMW, which can bring it to 45-47, and with Taunt Debuff goes to 51-53 +1 for 10 Rounds 4x a day with Bard Song. That's without counting Bless or Aid potions, cuz I don't know if they're available at low magic worlds.<br/>\n<br/>\nAC is pretty good:<br/>\n<br/>\n10 Base<br/>\n+1 DEX (With Empowered cat's you'll get at least 11 with a 1 roll, so if you want to be conservative, consider this a 0)<br/>\n+20 EMA<br/>\n+8 Tumble<br/>\n+8 Full Plate<br/>\n+3 Tower Shield<br/>\n+4 Haste<br/>\n+1 Mage Armor<br/>\n____________________<br/>\n<br/>\n55 AC on its own and Expertise adds another +5 at the cost of AB, making it 60 maximum with 50% concealment from II. A +5 Shield can add another 5, Monk boots another 5 (and 3 to Dex to make sure you will hit +1 modifier all the time), Tenser's adds 4 Dodge but removes a few of those (not on WoG ). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, is this what you wanted to see?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd thanks, glad u like him!<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

However, to those who play where Tenser's is unchanged, your suggestion is quite valid, but there's a catch: Longsword requires Martial Weapons, which this toon doesn't have. Which feat would you suggest dropping for it? <br/>\n<br/>\nIn advance, please don't suggest that I drop Expertise, LOL. That seems like the first feat people want to drop, but the Taunt / Expertise combo is SOOOOOOO good!

Your gear isn't CHANGED, meaning you keep your exact same gear, with everything active, bonuses from items, etc... The spell failure is custom because you no longer polymorph, you are yourself, only beefed up . <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the \"marginal\" bonus in AB, yeah, although in this case it would give only one extra attack, right? I have 3 APR by default, with Tenser's I'd get 4, no?<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Let me clarify even further how the spell I intend to use works. Well, as I have said, on WoG, you get to keep your gear, so the difference would actually be +5, not +3, because the GMW'ed Morningstar would remain as part of your gear. I have been playing a Wizard PM build of mine there lately and he uses Tenser's A LOT. He can even switch gear, like to a bow or crossbow while in Tenser's form, even gets 2 extra attacks with a crossbow without Rapid Reload LOL. <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

IMO a spellsword should have the penetration feats to compensate for the lower number of caster levels and not be completely dependent on the breach line of spells against SR. I think there is room for that here.\n<blockquote><div>\n<span style=\"font-size:100%;line-height:normal\">Ladies and Gentlemen: the Draconic Arcanist!<br/>\n<br/>\n Illusionist(26), Bard(4), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Human<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 16 (36)<br/>\n DEX: 8<br/>\n CON: 16 (18)<br/>\n WIS: 8<br/>\n INT: 16 (20)<br/>\n CHA: 8 (10)<br/>\n<br/>\n Human: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n 01: Illusionist(1): Expertise, Extend Spell, {Scribe Scroll}<br/>\n 02: Bard(1)<br/>\n 03: Illusionist(2): Armor Proficiency Heavy<br/>\n 04: Illusionist(3): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n 05: Illusionist(4)<br/>\n 06: Illusionist(5): Blind Fight, Empower Spell<br/>\n 07: Red Dragon Disciple(1)<br/>\n 08: Red Dragon Disciple(2): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n 09: Red Dragon Disciple(3): Knockdown<br/>\n 10: Red Dragon Disciple(4): (STR=22)<br/>\n 11: Red Dragon Disciple(5)<br/>\n 12: Red Dragon Disciple(6): STR+1, Weapon Focus: Morning Star, (STR=23)<br/>\n 13: Red Dragon Disciple(7): (CON=18)<br/>\n 14: Red Dragon Disciple(8)<br/>\n 15: Red Dragon Disciple(9): Improved Knockdown, (INT=18)<br/>\n 16: Red Dragon Disciple(10): STR+1, {Darkvision}, (STR=28), (CHA=10)<br/>\n 17: Bard(2)<br/>\n 18: Illusionist(6): Still Spell<br/>\n 19: Illusionist(7)<br/>\n 20: Illusionist(8): STR+1, (STR=29)</span></div></blockquote>\n I\u00a0know that you as a rule build for lvl 40 power and enjoy the challenge of playing a weaker character early on.

I can scribe 10 scrolls of Lesser Spell Breach after level 19, until then I will have to buy them. I never said leveling a Wizard was cheap, but it is doable .

It's more in line with the PnP TT in that it buffs the casters with improved AB, HP, STR, DEX, and adds a number of bonus attacks to make the toon's APR equivalent to having taken all full-AB class levels pre-epic. That would be +1 APR for this build. In addition, simple and martial weapon proficiencies are added as temporary properties to the armor the caster has on while casting. While the spell endures, 100% spell failure is applied.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs best I can tell, it is <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Scripts.Detail&amp;id=791\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Moskwa's PnP Tenser's</a>. Though not perfect, it's far better than the annoying implementation that's the default in NWN. Just not losing all bonus slots from INT/CHA items or spell slot items makes it worthwhile, IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs one might imagine, such a spell can become the bread and butter of caster-heavy spellswords in modules that use it.

Really, I have had too much fun with my Iron Gnolem builds to try it so far. But, builds like Max's always tempt me to take the plunge.<br/>\n<br/>\n One point of clarification though\n<blockquote><div><strong>Maximillian Kane wrote:</strong><hr/>[...] Even if with default Tenser's, this build will be GREAT, you get +16 AB (+13 from Tenser's at lvl 26 and +3 from the Longsword you get as a weapon),\u00a0 [...]\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n Moskwa's PnP Tenser's (the one used on WoG) is awesome and no spellsword or melee mage should be without it.<br/>\n<br/>\n However, the default Bioware Tenser's is a pale shadow of Moskwa's - to the point of not being worth it for this build. Why? Well, Max's build is a strengther at heart. But, Bioware's Tenser's polymorph - if it can be said to shine anywhere - certainly does not shine with a strength build. The polymorph overrides strength down to 20. At level 40, that's a cost of 8 AB and damage right off the top. The additional loss of strength gear is nerfing (on average) another 3.5 AB and damage, assuming this guy would normally be able to cap strength, using gear and empowered Bull's in a moderate-magic or higher environment. Add to that the trade of a +3 sword for the +5 weapon one would instead get from GMW, and Bioware's Tenser's isn't especially attractive, even just considering melee offense. Account for the inability to cast spells while polymorphed (part of the offensive threat of any spellsword is that, when hacking and slashing isn't getting the job done, he can lay down the smack with spells), and one might easily conclude that overall offense is weaker than meleeing without Tenser's. Meanwhile, defense suffers even more. This build invests several feats to be an armored caster, but Bioware's Tenser's nerfs the AC benefit of armor and (even in a low-magic world) never comes close to making up for 11 AC from plate+tower, nevermind (even with EMA) the loss of shield bonuses and stacking dodge bonuses from boots, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n BTW, I want to be clear that none of this is intended as a negative comment on this build. It is yet another complaint about Bioware's Tenser's implementation. It just saddens me that the spell that really ought to be the arcane spellsword's best friend is just, well... <em>not</em>. Bioware ought to have called it Tenser's Tease.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

How's it going?<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving started this guy on WoG, I have slightly tweaked the leveling order for a little less difficult levelling process, this build is doing just fine, soloing the starting quests easily, but it does need to craft A LOT of scrolls in order to adventure. The good news is that it's not really a major issue. What IS a major issue is that on WoG, with the improved summoning system, Summon Creature 3 has specifically \"lagged\" behind all other summoning spells, while Summon Creature 4 calls a very powerful creature to fight by your side. So, for WoG specifically, I tweaked this build a bit in the leveling order. Wizard 1 / Bard 1 / Wizard 5 (total) / RDD 1 / Wizard 7 (total) / and then going ham on RDD levels. This way, we can craft 30 Summon Creature 4 scrolls, which will be a great boon to your combat strategy. That also means that you need to delay Bard 2 to level 18 so you can take Still Spell on that level. It's not a major problem, just a slight tweak that'll give me Improved Invisibility and Stoneskin, as well as Summon Creature 4 to go through the leveling more easily. Lots of scrolls to craft, but a lot more options to buff up. Buying potions and scrolls also helps, but who would do that when they can craft these on their own?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Similarly, not having KD, I wonder how you survive the early levels, since at least I have the habit of KDing my enemies so they can't hit me, but I do like what you did with the stats. You gave up some HP and Fort saves for an extra point of AB, which was quite clever and something I would consider doing with mine too, since that extra point in DEX also makes it so I don't need to empower Cat's Grace to always get full DEX bonus to AC. Nice catch!<br/>\nAlthough I understand your reasoning behind going for Penetration, you give up so much for it that I wonder if it's really worth it. You gave up KD, IKD and AS for +6 CLs when you face certain types of High-SR monsters. I guess it's a matter of personal preference, but I really don't see the appeal.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, kudos for the build, my friend!\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
