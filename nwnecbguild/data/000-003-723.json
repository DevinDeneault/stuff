And lovely attack?, armor and gear choices?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll i see is focus on dragon form, and dragons are not my cup of tea,\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI play on the switch, so multiplayer/modules are not something to aim for,\u00a0<br/>\nIm playing the so beloved OC that we all love, with the dlcs, and 10ish \" modules\",\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nHavent found any ideas on the \"pure bear build\" so i thought, why not try here, share ur ideas, theorycrafting it is, and oh , its a lvl 40 build im looking for,\u00a0<br/>\nBest would be when i finally unlock dragon shape, i can safely ignore it.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nBest reagards, Z0RnN , Sweden<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

However in the past I've played niche Wild Shape builds for the sake of playing a niche Wild Shape build, so I have a few suggestions. Note that almost all of them can be improved by focusing on a different form.<br/>\n<br/>\nDru/Ass DC assassin (even more useless in EE than it was in 1.69).<br/>\nDru/Bard/PM AC tank.<br/>\nDru/BG smiter.<br/>\nDru/CoT smiter.<br/>\nDru/Monk/Figh stunner.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I hear its commonplace in countries like Canada for bears to break into cars for that delicious peanut butter sandwich...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, you are asking for a min-maxed druid bear form. This is my thoughts from a technical standpoint.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Dire Bear form -&gt; at least Druid 12, infinite wild shape is even better with Druid 22<br/>\n<br/>\n2. At least one level of Monk, for Monk UBAB for bears + Flurry of Blows which essentially doubles your attacks, Evasion, Wisdom AC, Monk Speed/Improved Knockdown (if you go that far)<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Buffs / Item bonuses. There is a lot to consider here. Only magical properties from Helmet/Armor/Shield transfer. Only the maximum bonus transfers (ie a +4 AC armor and +2 AC shield will transfer to +4 deflection AC). Everything else has to come from spell buffs (ie. Druid spells), UMD, Items or teammates.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>a. Str with Bull's Strength / Blood Frenzy / Aura of Vitality spells + Str bonuses on helmet/armor/shield\nc. Con with Blood Frenzy / Aura of Vitality,\u00a0 Bonuses on helmet/armor/shield,\u00a0Endurance from potions/scrolls with UMD\ne. Deflection AC from equipped items, brooch of shielding (+4 AC)\ng. Dodge and other AC -&gt; Mage Armor cast from UMD or a teammate would give you least +2 AC (armor, dodge) maybe a bit more, also potentially Divine Shield\ni. Mind immunity -&gt; from items, clarity potions, lesser mind blank/mind blank scrolls with UMD\nk. Freedom -&gt; Freedom of movement spell from druid\nm. Divine Might/Divine Shield to add divine damage to attacks, or add dodge AC -&gt; due to alignment restrictions the best way to access this is probably Cleric, which has the side effect of giving you an extra spellbook, but you will lose access to the Thieves Hood which may or may be important in your environment or your discipline score. Blackguard or Paladin will require 3 levels of investment and alignment shifting if you take one level of monk as well.</details>\n\n4. Stats -&gt; only your Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma scores transfer when you turn into bear form, so your Strength, Dexterity and Constitution stats shouldn't be your focus with starting stats or leveling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway have a look at the technical details, and if wanted to tell us more about what you want in the build for example do you want to be able to use divine might for divine damage, post a reply and maybe I can flesh something out.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso let me know if you want dragon shape or not, you can still play dragon shape builds but it might be reasonable to drop the idea of divine damage with your bear with the tremendous investment required to obtain dragon shape.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd can you remind us the environment you plan to play this in and what is the highest level you expect to achieve in this environment.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">If you're happy to play at level 40 without levelling up from level 1 then I'd go with a Dru12/Pal3/CoT25 bear smiter.<br/>\nThis is a very gimmicky build, combining Wild Shape with Divine Wrath and Smite Evil, but it's one of the best bear builds that can be made. It has 4 shifts per day, 3 smites per day, and 1 Divine Wrath per day. It also requires two alignment changes (Lawful Neutral / Neutral Good to Lawful Good and back).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe build has high HP, extremely high saves, and immunities to disease, fear, and poison.<br/>\nDamage is surprisingly decent, although it requires +11 STR and +12 CHA to max out which is hard to achieve with vanilla item merging. With +11 STR, +12 CHA, Divine Might, and Divine Wrath, the damage is 1d8 + 16 (+ 308 Smite Evil) Physical + 26 Divine. Minimum smite damage is 325 Physical + 26 Divine, minimum smite critical damage is 650 Physical + 52 Divine. The Divine damage ignores DI/DR, so even the toughest enemies will take 26 damage per hit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main problems are low AB (and no real way to improve it in vanilla NWN), low AC, your attacks are +0 for DR purposes, and you're a shifter. Divine Wrath gives +11 AB but it's a once per day ability and it only lasts for 15 rounds. The only other way to increase your AB in vanilla NWN is through spells, since weapons don't merge for unarmed forms. Casting Stoneskin on yourself before shifting will make your attacks count as +5 for DR purposes, but once it wears off they will be back to +0 attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nCalled Shot can be swapped for another feat such as Improved Critical: Scimitar if you want a different pre-epic feat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn't bother with the skill progression since it's just a rough draft, but you can max Discipline, Spellcraft, Tumble, put ranks into skills that require training, and almost max another skill such as Spot.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nClass: Druid 12 / Paladin 3 / Champion Of Torm 25<br/>\nRace: Human<br/>\nAlignment: Lawful Good / Lawful Neutral / Neutral Good (requires 2 alignment changes)<br/>\nPlayability: 40 PvM / 40 PvP<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 14<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 8<br/>\nWIS: 14 (16)<br/>\nINT: 10<br/>\nCHA: 18 (28)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Druid(1): Blind Fight, Power Attack<br/>\n02: Druid(2)<br/>\n03: Druid(3): Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br/>\n04: Paladin(1): CHA+1, (CHA=19), *Alignment Change*<br/>\n05: Paladin(2)<br/>\n06: Paladin(3): Divine Might<br/>\n07: Druid(4): *Alignment Change*<br/>\n08: Druid(5): CHA+1, (CHA=20)<br/>\n09: Druid(6): Knockdown<br/>\n10: Druid(7)<br/>\n11: Druid(8)<br/>\n12: Druid(9): CHA+1, Improved Critical: Unarmed, (CHA=21)<br/>\n13: Druid(10)<br/>\n14: Champion of Torm(1)<br/>\n15: Champion of Torm(2): Toughness, Called Shot<br/>\n16: Champion of Torm(3): CHA+1, (CHA=22)<br/>\n17: Champion of Torm(4): Improved Power Attack<br/>\n18: Champion of Torm(5): Extra Smiting<br/>\n19: Druid(11)<br/>\n20: Druid(12): CHA+1, (CHA=23)<br/>\n21: Champion of Torm(6): Great Charisma I, Great Wisdom I, (WIS=15), (CHA=24)<br/>\n22: Champion of Torm(7)<br/>\n23: Champion of Torm(8): Epic Prowess<br/>\n24: Champion of Torm(9): CHA+1, Great Smite I, (CHA=25)<br/>\n25: Champion of Torm(10): Great Smite II<br/>\n26: Champion of Torm(11)<br/>\n27: Champion of Torm(12): Great Smite III<br/>\n28: Champion of Torm(13): WIS+1, (WIS=16)<br/>\n29: Champion of Torm(14): Great Smite IV<br/>\n30: Champion of Torm(15): Great Smite V<br/>\n31: Champion of Torm(16)<br/>\n32: Champion of Torm(17): CHA+1, (CHA=26)<br/>\n33: Champion of Torm(18): Great Smite VI, Great Smite VII<br/>\n34: Champion of Torm(19)<br/>\n35: Champion of Torm(20)<br/>\n36: Champion of Torm(21): CHA+1, Great Smite VIII, (CHA=27)<br/>\n37: Champion of Torm(22): Great Smite IX<br/>\n38: Champion of Torm(23)<br/>\n39: Champion of Torm(24): Great Smite X<br/>\n40: Champion of Torm(25): CHA+1, (CHA=28)<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nNaked Stats<br/>\nHitpoints: 376<br/>\nSkillpoints: 159<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 45/44/39<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Fear: +2<br/>\nBAB: 27<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 31 (melee), 27 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 9/20<br/>\nSpell Casting: Druid(6)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 2<br/>\n<br/>\nBuffed Stats (While shifted, assuming that you have +11 STR, +11 CON, +12 CHA, one +5 AC item, and Haste)<br/>\nAB: 27 (BAB) + 16 (STR) + 1 (Feats) - 1 (Size) = +43 (+54 with Divine Wrath) (+58/+69 when smiting)<br/>\nAC: 10 (Base) + 1 (DEX) + 4 (Tumble) + 5 (AC Bonus) + 5 (Shape Dodge Bonus) + 4 (Barkskin) + 4 (Haste) - 1 (Size) = 32<br/>\nHP: 376 (Base) + 400 (CON) + 40 (Feats) = 816<br/>\nFortitude: 25 (Base) + 10 (CON) + 15 (CHA) + 12 (CoT Bonus) = 62 (70 with Divine Wrath)<br/>\nReflex: 19 (Base) + 1 (DEX) + 15 (CHA) + 12 (CoT Bonus) = 47 (55 with Divine Wrath)<br/>\nWill: 20 (Base) + 3 (WIS) + 15 (CHA) + 12 (CoT Bonus) = 50 (58 with Divine Wrath)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Maybe the required items can be found in any of those?, lets not carve the original campaign in too stone, maybe i have to try online?

Monk 9 might be kinder as Stag has suggested but starting at level 15 the bear form wouldn't be as strong.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd spit-balling is always appreciated :)\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThat aside I believe you are underselling your skills somewhat here Stag, you have spent a few years studying the process of optimising builds and have suggested a number of improvements to my own, knowing the class is one thing from a gameplay perspective, but optimising stuff is another, and if the OP's writes the goals desired, within your limits I'm sure you can make useful commentary when it feels right<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
