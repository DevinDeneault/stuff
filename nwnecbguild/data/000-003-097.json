How much is needed to open common traps and locks when my INT modifier is at 14/2?<br/>\n You previously told that <strong>disable traps</strong> skill rank 11, is enough for DC&lt;36 traps. <strong>Open lock</strong> 15 will open locks DC&lt;35.

Nonetheless...<br/>\n<br/>\n Are you planning to morph this into a rogue skills build?\u00a0 You hadn't indicated that before and would require higher INT at the cost of AB and AC.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Find Traps</em> even locates epic traps.\u00a0 Arelith has implemented a common change that does not automatically disarm them.\u00a0 So what you do is use a sacrificial summon to attack the trapped container or walk across the trapped ground.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Your DEX will so high, a single point in Open Lock will open DCs around 30 plus whatever lockpicks are available.<br/>\n<br/>\n I wouldn't try to make a serious caster out of this combo.\u00a0 DCs will be horrible and limited to Level 4 spells max.<br/>\n<br/>\n Sure.\u00a0 You can try finessing a rapier with a shield but understand the moment you swap out the longbow, your AB will drop around 13 points (AB 32 instead of AB 45). Not to mention how pitiful your damage will be without enhanced arrows.\u00a0 Basically you'll just stand there praying to roll 20's to hit anything for a few points of damage each time plus whatever OnHit may be present.\u00a0 And it's DR penetration will be limited by the rapier's enhancement.\u00a0 I'm guess they don't have any +10 weapons on Arelith.<br/>\n<br/>\n Disable level is: skill ranks + INT modifier + Set Trap synergy + Take20.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n So, assuming at least 5 ranks in Set Trap, allocating 7 ranks in Disable Traps will disarm DCs of 7 + 2 + 2 + 20 = 31.\u00a0 That's enough to disarm every trap that any non-rogue can (DC&lt;36).\u00a0 That includes deadly blob, splash, frost, holy, negative, sonic and tangle; strong fire and spike; and average electrical and gas.\u00a0 Not bad for a measely 7 ranks (14 xclassed).<br/>\n<br/>\n With INT 14, no Search ranks need to be assigned but you'll need a LOT of patience because you'll only spot traps on a roll of 20, rerolling every 6 secs.\u00a0 To spot them in half that time, allot 10 ranks.\u00a0 To spot them the moment they come within perception range, you'd need Search 19 + INT 14.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I suppose a bard/AA/DwD5 may serve that sort of playstyle but I've never played one to confirm its effectiveness because the places I play are not alignment-blind like Arelith is.\u00a0 It wouldn't get to use its stance but could never get flanked.\u00a0 That's one step better than Uncanny Dodge.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
