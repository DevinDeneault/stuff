      "content": "<div>This build was inspired from the Swiss army guards of the Vatican, an elite force guarding the Pope himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted a maximum strength build that maintains a reasonable charisma for use with divine wrath. It's use is more apparent in WoG where you gain 1 extra round of divine wrath for every 5 CoT levels<br/>\n<br/>\nbut with buffed charisma you can have at least 8 rounds of it anyway, a good overboost for a tough boss fight. He hardly needs it anyway but it is a nice extra bonus that further enhances his fighting ability and adds to the style.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother WoG specific thing would be the HS usage as there the class can manufacture extra types of potions (such as CL 10 Haste ones &amp; UV) thus being more useful overall. Still in this build even without those additions <br/>\n<br/>\nit allows us to take all 7 GR. STR. feats &amp; ESF in Spot &amp; Discipline without wasting an Epic general feat for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nImproved Disarm was taken for the extra situational AB since we have a two-handed weapon. Called Shot is there for those that IKD or IDS won't work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA proper guard must be ever-vigilant and the Halberdier is like that, having an astonishing 57 Spot check to better do his duty.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Halberdier must always be on his feet no matter what, his incredible -after years of hard training- discipline will ensure that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Halberd as a weapon of choice besides being the theme weapon, it offers us the valuable (since 1.69 patch) dual damage type so that your enemies can't resist your blows no matter how much they try.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Halberier can be pretty sweet-talking to ladies as well, having good persuade skill   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>The Halberdier</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>(Fighter 12/ HS 5/ CoT 23)</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n RACE: Human<br/>\n<br/>\n ALIGNMENT: Lawful Neutral<br/>\n<br/>\n PLAYABILITY: PvM 1-40<br/>\n<br/>\n STARTING STATS:<br/>\n STR  - 17<br/>\n DEX  - 08<br/>\n CON - 14<br/>\n INT  - 13<br/>\n WIS  - 08<br/>\n CHA - 14<br/>\n<br/>\n ENDING STATS:<br/>\n STR  -  34<br/>\n DEX   - 08<br/>\n CON  - 14<br/>\n INT   - 13<br/>\n WIS   - 08<br/>\n CHA  - 14<br/>\n<br/>\n Hit Points: 520<br/>\n<br/>\n Skill Points: 182<br/>\n<br/>\n Discipline: 43 (65)<br/>\n Tumble: 40 (39)<br/>\n Spot: 43 (57)<br/>\n Spellcraft: 9 (10)<br/>\n Persuade: 8 (10)<br/>\n Search: 4 (6)<br/>\n Lore: 6 (10)<br/>\n Heal: 8 (7)<br/>\n<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fort/Ref/Will): 36/ 31/ 28  \u2192  38/ 33/ 30  (saves Vs spells)<br/>\n<br/>\n Naked AC: 21/ 29/ 32/ 37  (Full Plate \u2013 Tower Shield &amp; Cat's Grace) &amp; (Expertise)<br/>\n<br/>\n BAB: 30<br/>\n<br/>\n AB: +46/ +41/ +36/ +31  (Halberd)<br/>\n<br/>\n DMG: 1D10 +24/ 19-20 x3  (Halberd)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Crafting of Harper Potions ( Haste, Invisibility, Bull's, Cat's, UV, Cl/Cv )<br/>\n<br/>\n HS spells: Cat's grace &amp; Eagle's splendor each 1/day (stackable) &amp; Invisibility 1/day<br/>\n<br/>\n HS abilities: Deneir's Eye (+2 Vs Traps), Lliira's Heart (+2 Vs Mind effects), Tymora's Smile (+2 to all saves)<br/>\n<br/>\n Divine Wrath from CoT grants +9 AB/ +9 DMG/ +9 to all Saves for 6 (12) rounds {WoG}<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLEVELING GUIDE:<br/>\n<br/>\n01) Fighter (01): Expertise, Power Attack, Weapon Focus: Halberd<br/>\n02) Fighter (02): Cleave<br/>\n03) Fighter (03): Iron Will<br/>\n04) Fighter (04): Weapon Specialization: Halberd<br/>\n05) Fighter (05): <br/>\n06) Fighter (06): Skill Focus: Spot, Blind Fight<br/>\n07) Fighter (07): <br/>\n08) Fighter (08): Knockdown<br/>\n09) Fighter (09): Great Fortitude<br/>\n10) CoT (01): <br/>\n11) CoT (02): Improved Knockdown<br/>\n12) CoT (03): Lightning Reflexes<br/>\n13) CoT (04): Improved Critical: Halberd<br/>\n14) CoT (05): <br/>\n15) CoT (06): Alertness, Disarm<br/>\n16) CoT (07): <br/>\n17) CoT (08): Improved Disarm<br/>\n18) CoT (09): Toughness<br/>\n19) Fighter (10): Called Shot<br/>\n20) Fighter (11): <br/>\n21) CoT (10): Great Strength I, Epic Weapon Focus: Halberd<br/>\n22) HS (01): Epic Skill Focus: Discipline<br/>\n23) HS (02): <br/>\n24) Fighter (12): Great Strength II, Epic Weapon Specialization: Halberd<br/>\n25) CoT (11): <br/>\n26) CoT (12): <br/>\n27) HS (03): Great Strength III<br/>\n28) CoT (13): <br/>\n29) CoT (14): Armour Skin<br/>\n30) CoT (15): Great Strength IV<br/>\n31) CoT (16): <br/>\n32) HS (04): <br/>\n33) CoT (17): Great Strength V<br/>\n34) CoT (18): Epic Prowess<br/>\n35) CoT (19): <br/>\n36) CoT (20): Great Strength VI<br/>\n37) HS (05): Epic Skill Focus: Spot<br/>\n38) CoT (21): <br/>\n39) CoT (22): Great Strength VII, Epic Toughness I<br/>\n40) CoT (23): <br/>\n<br/>\n* Kudos for originality to Master Din for posting the original \"<strong>Guardsman</strong>\" from where this build was inspired.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hey dude!<br/>\n<br/>\nVery nice solid if somewhat low on AC build. I would tweak some stuff into this build. This build is more suited for DevCrit than the dwarven wall and it certainly has the feats to spare to get it (you take an Epic Toughness with that last CoT Bonus Feat cuz you have nothing else to take! Here`s what I would do with it:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Drop Called Shot or Lightning Reflexes (probably Lightning Reflexes, since you don't have Evasion anyway) for Great Cleave. Rework your starting stats, lowering STR to 16, increasing INT to 14 and DEX to 10, drop 1 Great Strength for OC and Epic Toughness for DC. Another option is to drop IKD, but that's less attractive.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou'll lose one AB point and 1 Reflex, but you'll gain SO MUCH offense with Devcrit, and with 32 STR, it's still a good DC they must save against. Also, you'll have more Skill points to invest in Spellcraft, so you'll actually have even higher saves against spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

Critical anyway unless i have a theme for it, but if you want to incorporate it into the build, for sure there is a lot of room with all these bonus feats.</div>"

      "content": "<div>I like the way you use HS to get the two Epic skill foci.<br/>\nI also like the way HS let you stack dex and cha buffs for a guaranteed dex 12+ and a longer lasting Divine wrath.<br/>\nThere are several classes that could have given you tumble, but here HS is a good choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe saves are amazing.<br/>\nThe damage potential is brutal (you didn't even mention power attack!).<br/>\nThe AB is up there among the best.<br/>\nWielding a two hander, you have to work with a self buffed AC of 29, or 49 with +5 items. That is OK, but not great since you won't get any shield bonuses.  Fortunately your AB is sufficiently high to use Expertise for another +5AC when needed.</div>",
