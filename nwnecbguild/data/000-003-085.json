(Gnome Edition xD)<br/>\n Due to what Hip said the other day, about liking Gnome Wizards. I decided to do the only race I haven't done one of yet. A gnome. Here is my attempt at an Arelith Wizard/Rogue.<br/>\n<br/>\n Wizard/Rogue 26/4, Gnome<br/>\n Str: 12<br/>\n Dex 13<br/>\n Con 14<br/>\n Wis 8<br/>\n INT 17 (27)<br/>\n CHA 10<br/>\n<br/>\n Wiz1) SF<br/>\n Wiz2)<br/>\n Wiz3) GSF<br/>\n Wiz4) +1 INT (18)<br/>\n Wiz5) Extend Spell<br/>\n Rog6) Dodge<br/>\n Rog7)<br/>\n Rog8)INT+1 (19)<br/>\n Wiz9)Mobility<br/>\n Wiz10) Sp. Pen<br/>\n Wiz11)<br/>\n Wiz12)INT+1 (20)Silent Spell<br/>\n Wiz13)<br/>\n Wiz14)<br/>\n Wiz15)Grt SP.pen, Emp. Spell<br/>\n Wiz16) INT+1 (21)<br/>\n Wiz17)<br/>\n Wiz18)Scribe Scroll<br/>\n Wiz19)<br/>\n Wiz20) INT+1 (22), Grt Fort<br/>\n Wiz21)Armor Skin<br/>\n Wiz22)<br/>\n Wiz23)ESF<br/>\n Wiz24)ES:EMA, INT+1 (23)<br/>\n Wiz25)<br/>\n Wiz26) GRT INT I (24)<br/>\n Wiz27)ESF: Con<br/>\n Rog28)INT+1 (25)<br/>\n Wiz29) ES: Hellball<br/>\n Wiz30)GRT INT II, GRT INT III (27)<br/>\n<br/>\n Unfortunately, I can't use the skill thing to calculate skill points and allocate them, so I'm unsure of how many I would have to spare. Instead of 18 INT I opted for 12 STR and 10 CON. For, a bit more carry space, and Appraise without a negative hinder.(or whatever skill gave you better prices)<br/>\n<br/>\n Tell me what you guys think, I'd love to hear it, and/or how bad it is.<br/>\n<br/>\n I opted for SF and GSF in the beginning due to some helpful benefits. Depending on what you take, anyway. (i.e level higher summon for Conj, or Magic missile spammer for Evo, with cannon fodder summons.)<br/>\n<br/>\n Unfortunately, my only dislike is that they can't use a quarterstaff. &lt; this makes me sad. What is a mage without his staff? Since there are no wands anyway.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

No bonus at Wiz 25, unfortunately.\u00a0 Hellball will cost you Armor Skin.<br/>\n<br/>\n I wasn't intimating that this was intended as a spellsword, only that weapon choice would be different if it would be a spellsword because you'd be considering the attack enhancement in that case.\u00a0 Basically, for a caster it doesn't matter what the weapon is, 1H or 2H, as long as the proficiency exists to equip it.\u00a0 A rapier would be a 2H weapon.\u00a0 There's a vanilla shortsword called Lucky One that adds ImpEvasion if you can find it.\u00a0 That would be very handy to avoid many evoc spells.\u00a0 But just one example, though.\u00a0 No doubt Arelith has its own custom weapons and maybe even a forge of sorts. You'll only glean a property effect in native form because item props do not merge with any arcane polymorphs or possessed familiar (you must pre-buff with Haste et al. before polymorphing).<br/>\n<br/>\n As I mentioned in another thread, traps for a caster mage help to conserve spells/day.\u00a0 And they will kill in situations that spells are borderline effective.\u00a0 A few stacks of deadly Negative traps will drop most dragons, constructs and elementals in their tracks.\u00a0 Just be careful of standing too close to the AoE type, like deadly Electrical.\u00a0 You and any party members in the active vicinity will suffer very high damage.\u00a0 Traps take some practice managing and planning the best layout, but provide a valuable dimension to spellcasting, especially in limited rest situations.\u00a0 Check <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2176824/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">my guide</a> for some general tips to help make the learning process easier.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, one final note about the UMD level I chose.\u00a0 It's not firm.\u00a0 You can reduce it to whatever you like (in increments of 5) because a wiz/rog doesn't perform a hardcore scroll check.\u00a0 Just assign whatever level to cover the VALUE of the item (like those monk robes I like so much).\u00a0 UMD 30 will allow any item up to around 1M gold to be equipped with the associated proficiency.\u00a0 That's probably overkill considering even divine wands will value at no more than around 10K gold, if that much.\u00a0 So it's more to assure that class-specific gear with lots of powerful properties can be used by the mage.</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">Well the highest ever I've seen (granted I won't be using a sword or Armor.) is around 70k. I figure for that much 26 (25) would be just good enough right? The 70k figure was from the most powerfulest Bastard Sword you could craft. So, that's what I'm going off of since its all I have persay. I'm just trying to get a rough estimate on how much '25' would cover due to not wanting to go over the top, and waste points spent elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, I reckon the Armor Skin +2 AC won't make a huge difference. 2 is huge, but MA gives 20 which for combat at least should hopefully cover up the lost, right?</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
