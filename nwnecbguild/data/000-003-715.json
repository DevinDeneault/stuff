Essentially no multiclass penalties (only at level 40 when the ranger level is taken).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course its a halfling, one of the coolest races in the game!\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly one sort of similar build in the archives (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build315872.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shadow of Magic Wizard 26/Rogue 13/SD 1</a>), here I've decided the costs of SD are too much with the pre-requisite feats, and chose to use ranger instead for the bonus feat, I also like builds with str 10+ due to encumbrance.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway this one looked nice so I thought I would put this one up for review, maybe there is stuff you guys would do differently, love to hear it.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Illusionist(26), Ranger(1), Rogue(13), Halfling\nSTR: 10\nCON: 16\nINT: 16 (19)\n\n01: Rogue(1): Blind Fight\n03: Illusionist(2): Weapon Finesse\n05: Rogue(2): {Evasion}\n07: Illusionist(4)\n09: Illusionist(6): Weapon Focus: Dagger\n11: Rogue(4)\n13: Rogue(6)\n15: Illusionist(8): Improved Knockdown\n17: Rogue(9)\n19: Rogue(11)\n21: Illusionist(9): Epic Weapon Focus: Dagger\n23: Illusionist(11)\n25: Illusionist(13)\n27: Illusionist(15): Great Dexterity II, Great Intelligence II, (DEX=23), (INT=19)\n29: Illusionist(17)\n31: Illusionist(19)\n33: Illusionist(21): Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=27)\n35: Illusionist(23): Epic Spell: Epic Warding\n37: Rogue(13): Defensive Roll\n39: Illusionist(26): Epic Dodge, Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor\n\nSkillpoints: 331\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8, Traps: +2, Fear: +2\nAB (max, naked): 38 (melee), 36 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Wizard(9)\n\n\n\n01: Disable Trap(4), Hide(4), Listen(4), Move Silently(4), Open Lock(1), Search(4), Set Trap(1), Spot(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(10),\u00a0\n03: Concentration(1), Save(11),\u00a0\n05: Disable Trap(3), Hide(4), Listen(3), Move Silently(4), Search(1), Spot(3), Tumble(4), UMD(4),\u00a0\n07: Concentration(3), Save(7),\u00a0\n09: Concentration(1), Save(15),\u00a0\n11: Disable Trap(2), Hide(5), Listen(4), Move Silently(5), Search(2), Spot(2), Tumble(5), UMD(5),\u00a0\n13: Disable Trap(2), Hide(1), Listen(2), Move Silently(1), Spot(4), UMD(1),\u00a0\n15: Concentration(5), Save(4),\u00a0\n17: Disable Trap(2), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(5), UMD(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n19: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(15),\u00a0\n21: Concentration(6), Spellcraft(19),\u00a0\n23: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n25: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(13),\u00a0\n27: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(21),\u00a0\n29: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(29),\u00a0\n31: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(37),\u00a0\n33: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(45),\u00a0\n35: Concentration(1), Save(55),\u00a0\n37: Disable Trap(3), Hide(17), Move Silently(17), Spot(10), Tumble(17), UMD(8),\u00a0\n39: Concentration(1), Save(9),\u00a0</details>\n<strong>Edit:</strong>\u00a0minor edit to leveling order and attribute gains</div>"

      "content": "<div><span style=\"color:#131513\">Thanks for the suggested tweaks!</span><br/>\n<em class=\"mention\">@webshaman1</em>\u00a0- for kukris you can swap toughness for exotic weapon proficiency, then the weapon foci to kukri's if you wish. Will cost 40hp in exchange for a wider crit range (which can be buffed with Keen Edge). Not a bad trade, I personally wanted a little more HP, but with empowered Endurance + Summons to tank for you, one could do fine.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the tip on\u00a0Belkar Bitterleaf, what an interesting character! Halfling Rogue/Barbarian with a +20 ring of jumping.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<em class=\"mention\">@conlaoch</em>\u00a0- for int 20, you can drop starting cons to 14, starting dex to 14 and increase starting int to 18 for +43 skill points at the cost of -1AB/-1AC/-1fort/-40hp, plus you can trade one great intelligence feat at level 27 for an epic skill focus: concentration or disable trap, epic energy resistance or armor skin. Bit expensive, but probably ok with Base AB 37 given the buffs in the build.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy WoG account is currently like a conveyor belt with all the build drafts I am trying to churn through btw to play test. <em class=\"mention\">@BlackCobra</em>\u00a0tells me if he sees a new toon on the server, he'll just assume its me and /tp Orion \"Another Toon???\" :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<em class=\"mention\">@Mick Dagger</em>\u00a0- Agree with you on Daggers there. Underrated weapon. I wanted to build more with such a weapon. No real bias I can see.</div>"

This would garner an additional 5 skill points without delaying Epic Dodge nor changing starting point distribution.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one desired MORE skill points, I would drop starting CON to 14, take INT 17, and STR 11 (for carry). Then, take INT+1 at level 4, and swap the level 27 Great Intelligence feat for a Great Dexterity. It will slightly delay the AB progression, but catches up at level 27. It trades 40 HP for 36 skill points and 8 lbs carry.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn another note, I like the daggers in this build, and would like to add in Empower Spell, but I can't have everything, and don't know that it would be worth trading Toughness for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: Some info ninja'd by Orion.</div>"
