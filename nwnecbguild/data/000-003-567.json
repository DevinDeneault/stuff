I FINALLY GOT THE WOG PW TO WORK.<br/>\n<br/>\nI dont know why it didnt work in past, as I installed Cep 2.65, and all the files.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I accidentally installed a file wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it's that the WOG Mithral Edition came out(Wasnt available before)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now I dont have to play in the offline Raine's WOG,1.69 version, solo, offline anymore, as can now play WOG PW ONLINE now.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso got Aielund to FINALLY work on my Smart Phone.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now I have the following NWN Mods, PW working on my Smartphone.<br/>\n<br/>\nWOG PW.<br/>\n<br/>\nAielund<br/>\n<br/>\nEye of Beholder<br/>\n<br/>\nCaereen<br/>\n<br/>\nLord of Terror<br/>\n<br/>\nDiablo Remake.<br/>\n<br/>\nBard's Tale<br/>\n<br/>\nWizardry<br/>\n<br/>\nPool of Radiance<br/>\n<br/>\nAttack on Ruins of Myth Drannor<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that's nice, but what's the point you all are probably wondering.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell now that I got access to that.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do any of you think is a good build for those PW's, Mods??<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd What how would u build that build??<br/>\n<br/>\nI am thinking of the following.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk 1/6/Druid 21/24/Rogue 13/14(Sneak Attacking Dragon)<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk 1/6/Druid 18/24/Shifter 14/16/18<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk 1/6/Cleric 12/19(Str, Mag/Druid 20/22(Insane Buffs, Spells, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDruid 24/25/Rogue 13/14/SD 2/3/4/5(Epic Dodge)(A Alternative to Max's Druid/Assassin/SD, where replace Assassin with Rogue, allowing to be a Dragon/Transformer/sneaker, HIP's sooner without waiting for cross class. Only thing that give up, is Paralyze, and get Sneak Attack Damage, Epic Dodge, and indispellability)<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk 9/Druid 26/SD 5(Epic Dodging)<br/>\n<br/>\nOut of those I think I like the following best.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Monk 1/6/Druid 21/24/25/Rogue 13/14 A sneak attacking dragon with Epic Dodge and Monk cheese<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Druid 24/Rogue 13/SD 3, (A Sneaking attacking Dragon with Epic Dodge, Hips, A Shadow companion, and can do so at a sooner lower level then Max's build. Lose out on Paralyze, but with Low Assassin DC, probably not gona paralyze anyway.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich of the either the above options, or which of these 2 options do you think I should go with???<br/>\n<br/>\nI am really torn between, would like to really do 1 of the 2 builds.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd once the build is chosen, can you all please help me with the build.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd see you all in the WOG PW sometime.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou'll know what to look for.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the name will probably be something like.<br/>\n<br/>\nWiloren Swift Rastirone.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You get 3x dragon shape uses per day, if you get morded you may have to recast everything including dragon shape, add rest restrictions, I think you get the picture.

Maybe 6 levels of Monk would, but surely not just 1 monk level in the build would prevent epic dodge combined with Dragon Shape<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact 1 level of Monk would help get Evasion, one of the requirements of Epic Dodge.<br/>\n<br/>\nEpic Dodge says that need Evasion, Dex 25, 1,2 other class ability/feats, and either 13 levels of Rogue, or 9 monk levels + 5 levels of SD or 10 levels of SD<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I take 1 level of Monk/25 Druid/14 levels of Rogue, And if I start with a 18 dex, 17 Wis.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat leaves me with 10 stat ups(every 4 levels/40 levels) 13 feat slots(every 3 levels/40 levels), (7 of those feats are epic feats that can use to take great dex and great wis), 2,3,4,5,6,7 bonus feats/epic feats, depend on how many epic druid or epic rogue levels that take in epic levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nBetween the stat ups, and great dex, easy to get to 25 dex, AND 30 wisdom.

To end with 25DEX/30WIS you need a minimum of 18 ability increases, which requires 8 epic feats (G DEX / G WIS). On top of that you then need Dragon Shape and Epic Dodge for a total of 10 epic feats. There is no possible combination of Dru/Monk/Rog or Dru/Monk/SD that can manage that in vanilla NWN. Dru20/Monk1/SD19 can get 10 epic feats but since G DEX isn't an SD bonus feat it still can't qualify for both Dragon Shape and Epic Dodge.</div></blockquote>\n\nOk Fine, no Monk/Druid/Rogue Dragon/Epic Dodge.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut its not that big a loss, as I think I like the Druid 25/Rogue 13/SD 2 idea just as good.<br/>\n<br/>\nIndispellable Druid 25/Rogue 13/SD 2, Epic Dodge, Dragon Shape,  Hips, Sneak Attack, get to have my cake and eat it too<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least I think thats doable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could be wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut probably not<br/>\n<br/>\nSo narrowed down to that build.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now that build chosen, any advice, tips, etc, for that build??<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the help, comments<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I didn't need any powerful items. Just a thieves's hood, a few wisdom boosts on rings, and a little strength to carry equipment and I was good to play.<br/>\nYou will notice the lowest Druid levels in these builds is 28 on Max's -&gt; undispellability (and caster levels) is highly valued.<br/>\nDon't play a dragon build without Monk in it in an unfamiliar environment, if you are still learning.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nTips - druid summons are empowered on WoG similar to cleric animal domain. Use em until you have Druid 7/Monk 1 for Bear Form and Stone Skin, then start fighting as a Monk Bear. Just put all your spells as summon creatures. Use the book of summons to change your Summon II creature (summon I spell) to Brown Bear. Let the bear kill stuff so you are not put in danger, until you are stronger. The first few levels a critical hit or two probably will kill you so don't get mobbed. Annoy a monster with a sling and pull em away from his friends to defeat em rather than charge in. Also don't be afraid to die. Just focus on improving and you will find things get easier, because your skills as a player improve.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWeb is correct in fact I would rephrase - a lot of important bosses have true sight or sneak immunity. Just focus on building a strong druid with dragon shape, with a little monk and something else you like.<br/>\nDon't chase HiPS in a dragon shape build, do that when you are more experienced.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon't be discouraged. But my advice is don't start with unusual builds in WoG like epic dodging dragon shape druids especially if you are playing from a smart phone and playing solo.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nStart with something you know is strong, then reconsider where to go from there. The unusual builds can wait until you are better as a player, it will happen if you stick with it. You will have more fun and less problems. Once you are more familiar with the environment then you can play less powerful builds.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Because that's the MINIMUM Druid level for INDISPELLABILITY except for Mords.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. In a 3 class level split, there is Usually not enough levels for 1 of the 2 other classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I want to go Monk 6(say for IKD), an or 7,8,9 Rogue levels(enough for decent skills, Sneak Attack, Uncanny Dodge, etc, then 25,26,27 Druid levels is most can take.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I want Monk 1/Cleric 14/Druid 25, I cant take more then 25,26,27 Druid levels, because If I do, then its pointless to go with less then 12,13,14 cleric levels, and only taking 11 cleric levels. If have to take 28+ levels of Druid, then might as well scrap the build at that point, because not enough cleric levels for the build to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I go with:<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk 1/Druid 25/Shifter 14, if I have 27,28,29+ druid levels, I wont be able to take the minimum of about 12,13,14 shifter levels to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts a matter of fit, and what want to do. If want to go with 28/30/32/34 Druid levels, your better off with either 2 classes, or Monk 6/Druid 32/SD 2, or a Monk 6/Druid 34.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the Druid/Monk/Rogue build I might be able to go with either Monk 1/Druid 29/30/Rogue 9/10 or Monk 6/Druid 28/Rog 6, but prob is either I wouldnt get Monk IKD helping feat progession, selection, an or wouldnt maybe not get high enough Rogue levels. Monk 6/Druid 25/Rog 9 gets me Monk IKD, indispellable druid, except Mords, and high enough Rogue levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf u have a way for me to get high enough monk levels, high enough cleric levels, high enough rogue levels, while still having 28,30,32,34, etc, druid levels, I am definately all ears for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou said that the Summon Book in WOG beefs up summons, like Cleric Animal Domain.(I already knew that from my Monk/Druid/Shifter.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I take Cleric Animal Domain, does that STACK with the Summon Book in WOG??<br/>\n<br/>\nWould my Druid get to have his level 1 summons bumped up to level 3, with +1 summon level(Book), an another + 1 summon level(Cleric Animal Domain), and his Level 2 Summons bumped up to level 4??<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the answer is yes, then its most definately worth playing a:<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk 1/Cleric 14/Druid 25, with Animal, Str, Magic, as 3 Domains.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly problem with that is Cleric Spells dispellable, but that is offset by the higher summoning levels, Cleric Cheese.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I got my Monk 6/Druid 18/Shifter to get its Dragon at level 30, so dont have to use only epic druid level bonus epic feats, as can use epic Rog, epic Shifter, Epic Cleric feats, to still bevable to take Dragon at level 30 to level 33.<br/>\n<br/>\nGoing by what u have said so far<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I am thinking of<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk 1/6/Druid 25/27/30/33/Rog 6/9<br/>\n<br/>\nOr<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk 1/Druid 25/26/Shifter 13/14(Shifter gets important epic bonus feat at either 13,14 level<br/>\n<br/>\nOr <br/>\n<br/>\nMonk 1/Cleric 13/14/Druid 25/26<br/>\n<br/>\nOr<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk 6/Ranger 9/Druid 25<br/>\n<br/>\nLOTS OF ATTACKS PER ROUND<br/>\n<br/>\nIf u have explanations, breakdowns of better builds that can give me high enough levels of Monk, or Cleric, or Rogue, in addition to 27+ Druid levels, instead of only 25 indispellable except by Mords, levels, then I am definately all ears for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your interesting, helpful post.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
