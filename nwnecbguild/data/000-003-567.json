It's a charisma divine damage, bard/curse song bard with great saves and great AC, 400hp (640hp capped).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThought I would share it before I play-tested it to see if there are any suggestions...<br/>\n<br/>\n- Bard 26 for eventual 'undispellable' buffs, possibility of DC casting with ultra high charisma (honestly unsure how good this is), wands of haste and improved invisibility<br/>\n- Blackguard 4 for great saves, divine might/shield (for up to +15 divine damage/hit and +15 AC for up to 15 rounds), BAB 26+ for 4 APR and stackable bull's strength<br/>\n- RDD 10 to boost stats especially melee AB, and other good things like +4 AC, search as a class skill<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 26-4-10 class split is not original, there are seven builds in the ECB archives and filter I could find, the most recent build being Valerfor's <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/moghedien-melody-of-the-dark-bard-26-bg-4-rdd-10-t2350150.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Moghedien - Melody of the Dark</a>. All of them except one are strength focused. The remaining build is cha-focused, called\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build117677.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bard 26 / BG 4 / RDD 10 by\u00a0NYCfarmkid</a>. It was written in 2004, it goes human, gets Cha 32 and sets intelligence to 8(10), and goes dev crit. I wanted more skill points with all the great bard skills on offer, no dev crit to observe all the divine damage in all its glory. Bard Song 26 with lasting inspiration (which could be a realistic goal with an item or two) can add up to +15 to all skills for 105 round duration means I don't necessarily have to max them although it is nice for some skills. Conversely, it can remove up to -15 to enemy skills such as discipline and concentration to make enemies be knocked down or taunted more easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few AB boosters in here:<br/>\n-&gt; Bard song 26 for +2 AB, War Cry for +2 AB, Curse Song 26 for -5 to 6 AC, Taunt for -6 AC, add effective mundane +15-16 AB to the listed base AB 38 = effective mundane AB 53-54<br/>\n<br/>\nAC: Full plate (8) + Tower (3) + Tumble 40 (8) + RDD 10 (4) + Divine Shield (15) + Bard Song (+5 - dodge cap hit) +4 dex (2) = AC 45 with mundane full plate/tower shield, AC 65 with +5 equipment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith two prestige classes I could choose whatever race I wanted without worrying about exp penalties. I was very sorely tempted to chose elf for keen senses, but human was just so much stronger.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would drop Craft Wand for either Improved Critical, Improved Knockdown, ESF: Discipline or Toughness in single player.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tharizdun\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tharizdun</a>\u00a0was a deity created by Gary Gygax and Robert Kuntz, the original creator and pioneers of DnD. I liked the themes of Tharizdun being darkness, decay, malignant knowledge combined with the blackguard class, bardic and RDD power. For an added RP bonus, the character can spam the darkness spell in full plate and tower during combat from level 2 and 3 spell slots with no chance of failure with darkness not having a somatic component, like a true lord of darkness, damaging enemies with divine damage, taunting them and crippling them with his/her curse song.\u00a0<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Bard(26), Blackguard(4), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Human\nPvM 1-40, low-mid magic\nSTR: 16 (26)\nCON: 14 (16)\nINT: 14 (16)\n\n01: Bard(1): Power Attack, Cleave\n03: Bard(3): Blind Fight\n05: Bard(5)\n07: Red Dragon Disciple(1)\n09: Red Dragon Disciple(3): Knockdown\n11: Blackguard(1)\n13: Bard(7)\n15: Blackguard(3): Divine Might\n17: Bard(8)\n19: Red Dragon Disciple(7): (CON=16)\n21: Red Dragon Disciple(9): Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar, (INT=16)\n23: Bard(9)\n25: Bard(11)\n27: Bard(13): Still Spell\n29: Bard(15)\n31: Bard(17)\n33: Bard(19): Epic Skill Focus: Perform\n35: Bard(21)\n37: Bard(23): Great Charisma I, (CHA=25)\n39: Bard(25): Great Charisma II, (CHA=26)\n\nSkillpoints: 292\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +4\nAB (max, naked): 38 (melee), 26 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Bard(6)\n\n\n01: Disable Trap(1), Discipline(4), Hide(4), Lore(4), Open Lock(1), Perform(1), Set Trap(1), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(1),\u00a0\n03: Concentration(2), Discipline(1), Lore(1), Perform(2), UMD(1),\u00a0\n05: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Taunt(4), UMD(1),\u00a0\n07: Discipline(1), Listen(4),\u00a0\n09: Discipline(1), Search(4),\u00a0\n11: Discipline(1), Save(7),\u00a0\n13: Discipline(1), Tumble(10), UMD(7),\u00a0\n15: Discipline(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n17: Discipline(1), Perform(3), Tumble(5), UMD(4),\u00a0\n19: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Search(7),\u00a0\n21: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(3),\u00a0\n23: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(5), UMD(1),\u00a0\n25: Concentration(6), Discipline(1), Perform(1),\u00a0\n27: Discipline(1), Listen(2), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n29: Discipline(1), Perform(3), Taunt(4),\u00a0\n31: Discipline(1), Perform(5), Save(3),\u00a0\n33: Concentration(5), Discipline(1), Perform(2),\u00a0\n35: Discipline(1), Perform(1), Taunt(2), Save(4),\u00a0\n37: Concentration(6), Discipline(1), Perform(1), Taunt(5), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n39: Concentration(4), Discipline(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(2),\u00a0</details></div>"
