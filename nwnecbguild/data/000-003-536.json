Fighter would work best and to offset the possible XP penalty, go for Half elf.  If you take fighter as your first lvl you get 2 feats.  PBS and toughness come to mind.  Also if you go fighter here, you can lower your wis stat, and ramp up your str and dex a bit.  <br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>shia luck wrote:</strong><br/>\nThe two things I'd suggest are moving called shot earlier.

Rapid shot with a fairly high Dex works out a bit better.  If you go with fighter, you could take Weapon finesse, and keep the Str at 10, and crank the dex up as high as you can go.  But I think keeping rapid shot in it's slot is a good call.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>shia luck wrote:</strong><br/>\nA slightly different way of doing things would be to raise DEX, not WIS.

However if you go fighter/wiz/AA then you gain extra feats with the fighter class and you can look at getting Spring attack and at least mitigate some of the AoO's.  If you do grab the fighter class, then you may have the slots for blind fighting.  I find this is one of the most useful feats, as I have had many enemies come up with concealment active.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Decent.  But you would be better to drop the dex by a point and goose your int (and/or) con.  The Spread of bard lvls need not be so drastic either, Del.  You simply take the half-elf race, and start off with a few lvls of fighter.  That gets you some darn good starting feats and with a slightly higher INT you will get more skill points.  Trust me, this is one time when going Half elf is better then a full one.  GDL discovered that when he shocked all of us and came up with <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build219413.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#FF0000\">The Iron Archer: Fighter 14 / Bard 4 / Arcane Archer 22</span></a>  Check his build out and go down the thread a bit, you will find his No XP Pen. version there.<br/>\n<br/>\n   As you can see, the fighter class brings some more feats into the mix, as well as the nice addition of HPs.  You also get the automatic capacity for wearing heavy armor, something an AA build like this can do without harming his/her AB with the bow.  I currently have one or two of Grizzled Dwarflord's Iron Archers on WoG, along with a bard version of Dins <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build249771.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#FF0000\">Bladed archer</span></a>.

      "content": "<div>I know this ship has already sailed, but I just finished playing an archer all the way through to level 40 in MP modules, so I wanted to add a couple thoughts. I agonized between a Rogue/Wizard/AA and a Fighter/Wizard/AA. It was pretty close and much of the decision came down to role play (scouting, disarming traps, etc.) and skills versus more feats and a beefier approach to archery. I like playing sneaky characters and scouts, so I have to recommend considering rogue as the other base class. You already have good fighter build advice, so here is a little more on the rogue build.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy rogue? Well, the archer is already a dexer, so why not support it with a dexer base class? I know everyone loves AB and the fighter build has a couple points of AB over the rogue when using the bow. But, take Weapon Finesse (and take it fairly early) so that you can hit something with your rapiers when you have to melee (and you will), as the WF build has a higher melee AB. I also find that the stealthy build has a good chance of sneaking around and getting in some nice sneak attack damage against flat-footed foes. That extra +4d6 can be very significant.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, let's not forget AC. Having Uncanny Dodge is a nice benefit of the rogue build, since a good chunk of your AC is Dex-based. And, even if you go the heavy armor route, you will be looking for Dex-buffing items anyway to increase ranged AB. So, you might as well dress to take advantage of it. Of course, the rogue doesn't get the use of heavy armor as does a fighter, but I usually forego that anyway, as it hinders my abilities as a scout. And, there is the issue of encumbrance. This build really can't deal with plate + tower + longbow, since that's 103 pounds on a build encumbered at 116 pounds. But, even on a STR 16 build (encumbered at 153 pounds), it can be tedious to start out over 2/3 of the way to encumbered. <br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, keep in mind that, though CBC gives an AC stat for the bulkiest armor you can wear plus a tower shield, you won't ever have that shield out when you are using your bow. When bow-wielding, the rogue build AC is 10 + 2(tumble) + 2(leather) + 6(DEX) = 20 and that's at 13 pounds for the armor and the bow. Of course, you might want the tower shield handy for use with the rapier when in melee (AC=23, weight 66 pounds for the two weapons + armor and shield). The same math for the fighter build with heavy armor gives AC of 10 + 8(full plate) + 1(DEX) = 19 and weighing in at 53 pounds and sword-and-board melee configuration with AC=22 at 106 pounds, assuming a longsword.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother real plus for a rogue build is Evasion. Once again: this is a dexer build and one of the best ways to take advantage of that defensively is to be able to shrug off most of the spells casters will be spamming at your party. Taking a late level of Wizard (and all those rogue skill points) allows maintaining a high spellcraft skill, so saves against spells are better than they would be with a fighter build.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, here's the build.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Rogue(8), Illusionist(2), Arcane Archer(10), Elf</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 14<br/>\nDEX: 18 (23)<br/>\nCON: 12<br/>\nWIS: 10<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Rogue(1): Point Blank Shot<br/>\n02: Rogue(2): {Evasion}<br/>\n03: Rogue(3): Weapon Finesse, {Uncanny Dodge I}<br/>\n04: Rogue(4): DEX+1, (DEX=19)<br/>\n05: Rogue(5)<br/>\n06: Rogue(6): Weapon Focus: Longbow<br/>\n07: Rogue(7)<br/>\n08: Rogue(8): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br/>\n09: Illusionist(1): Rapid Shot, {Scribe Scroll}<br/>\n10: Arcane Archer(1)<br/>\n11: Arcane Archer(2)<br/>\n12: Arcane Archer(3): DEX+1, Improved Critical: Longbow, (DEX=21)<br/>\n13: Arcane Archer(4)<br/>\n14: Arcane Archer(5)<br/>\n15: Arcane Archer(6): Toughness<br/>\n16: Arcane Archer(7): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br/>\n17: Arcane Archer(8)<br/>\n18: Arcane Archer(9): Blind Fight<br/>\n19: Arcane Archer(10)<br/>\n20: Illusionist(2): DEX+1, (DEX=23)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 176<br/>\nSkillpoints: 178<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 10/8/19 (Spells: 15/13/24), Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +1<br/>\nBAB: 17<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 23 (melee), 29 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 18/23<br/>\nSpell Casting: Wizard(1) (consider Mage Armor, Grease, Protection from Alignment, etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDisable Trap 10(14), Hide 21(27), Listen 21(23), Move Silently 21(27), Open Lock 10(16), Search 11(15), Set Trap 10(18), Spellcraft 23(25), Spot 21(23), Tumble 10(16), UMD 11(10), remaining skillpoints 9<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a lot of flexibility in spending skill points. My role for this character included most of the scouting duties, so those skills are high. There is room to cross-class some discipline (a weakness in a build that otherwise does well with skills). Since my partner was a tank with decent knockdown resistance, I put some extra points into heal and lore. If your PW has decent class-restricted magic items, the UMD can come in handy. I like to be able to don Monk equipment and the use of cleric scrolls can be helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, as mentioned above, the late level of mage allows a good bump to spellcraft to help with saves to maximize the benefit of Evasion. That, and the +1 to BAB is why I chose Wizard for the final pre-epic level instead of Rogue. One could go with Rogue 9 there instead and trade those benefits for +1 base fortitude save, 2 more HP, and an extra d6 damage on sneak attacks. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere's no way to compete with the fighter build in terms of HPs and this build won't have as many feats. On that note, I will say that, while I like the idea of Called Shot, 1) it can be taken later since the -4 attack penalty is more than you want to deal with at low levels, and 2) if it came down to it, I would take Weapon Finesse over called shot for this sort of build, unless the party is absolutely desperate for ranged debuffing. On this build, I decided on the other feats instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's it. I love archers and had a tough time deciding between this guy and a fighter build I worked up. Ultimately, Evasion, Uncanny Dodge, and a ton of skill points won the day, but either one would be fun. BTW, if you do end up taking your archer epic, it is huge fun. Awesome AB, good damage output in Rapid Shot mode (especially if hasted), high enough reflex save to be virtually immune to many spells, very nice AC that increases as you buff your AB, a 19d6 fireball (DC 50+) 3x per day, etc.</div>"

I read through some of the other threads here and I guess I didn't realize it was inappropriate to <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=36&amp;start=10#p122\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">post builds</a> in the Build Request forum, where people are sometimes <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=19#p59\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">asking for builds</a>. If I thought I was posting a more original build, I would have given it its own thread (in a different sub-forum). But, I thought I was just giving advice on an fairly straightforward rogue-based archer build, and I included the leveling to illustrate it clearly. Is that wrong for the Build Request forum?<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the builds the OP was looking for... For certain, will saves are a big weakness for AA-heavy builds. At least elves get the +2 versus mind-affecting and Protection from Alignment can help (and don't forget that Resistance cantrip), but archers usually need help against the various hold/charm/etc. spells. In my mind, this is another good reason for a build with enough skill points to max spellcraft on wizard levels (and a later level of wizard). Since the OP mentions he would be mostly soloing, this archer may not be able to get strong buffing, so some way to fill that hole can be important.</div>"

As you note, how to deal with it depends somewhat on how the D'Alessandro's PW works. If he played on an actual capped level 20 server where he will hit 20 and then play this character at that level from then on, then just drop one from Dex and add two points to Wis at the start and be happy with the bump to will saves. Or, sacrifice some skills by changing starting Int to 12 along with the change of Dex to 17, then raise Con to 14 for some extra HP and +1 Fort saves. Personally, for a build that will be doing lots of soloing, I would lean toward keeping the skills and bumping Will saves.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I got the same impression that leveling is generally slow on D'Alessandro's server, but not actually capped (just hazardous) above level 20. In that case, he may spend a long time pre-epic and may not want to give up that +1 AB, +1 AC, and +1 reflex (evasion) save during half of those levels. And, he may want the option of bumping Dex to 24 at level 21, even if leveling crawls along at that point.</div>"
