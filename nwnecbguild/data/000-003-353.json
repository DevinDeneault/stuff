      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">I would like to play a dwarven cleric with the domains trickery/travel on my PW where the maximum level is 20. I'm not that great at level 20 builds and I would really appreciate any build suggestions. The main idea is just to be able to self-buff, disarm traps, open locks and wreck things with some divine fury. Knockdown is kind of useful but the way the PW is set up you can \"Subdual\" creatures and knock them down, then toggle back to \"full damage\", which can lead to sneak attacks and even coup de graces. \"Subdualing\" also works with ranged weapons so I was thinking zen archery might be a possibility as well! Also, wands can be crafted as per generic NWN. I don't know how useful it is for a cleric, but I thought I would throw that bit of info in there. If anyone has a build in mind that I could make great use of I would be super grateful. Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are the spell changes for the PW: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://thaypw.org/showthread.php?tid=276\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://thaypw.org/showthread.php?tid=276</a><br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Forgot to say, it is a low-mid magic PW as well. I haven't seen much of the higher level equipment but from what I can tell.. There might be some +3s out there somewhere.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You can use my Dorna Trapspringer build as reference, although it's a level 40 build.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the link: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/dorna-trapspringer-cleric-15-fighter-6-rogue-19-t2269043.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dorna Trapspringer</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShe was a Dwarven Cleric / Rogue and I rebuilt her as a Cleric 15 / Rogue 19 / Fighter 6 STR-based build. It's very soloable. I'd start with Rogue at level 1 for maximum skill points, since you're going to need every single one you can get. Also, you will have to choose your two skill dumps, since you only have 2 Rogue levels in your spread after that 1st.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou'll also have an extra feat, because you'll take 2 Fighter levels as opposed to 1 in my build. So, can you use this build to make your own?<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hey dude!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe build looks pretty good, there could be a couple of tweaks you could make to improve it slightly, but they would be minor and they would also depend on the available items where you play, so I will suggest them, and you can evaluate whether they would make sense in your server.<br/>\n<br/>\n1- I would drop Luck of Heroes. I don't think that +1 to saves will help you succeed that many more saves. In its place, you can take: Weapon Proficiency Exotic (which will allow you to wield better weapons) or something else, like Called Shot.<br/>\n<br/>\n2- I'm not sure, but I think you can't take Extend Spell on a Fighter level. Anyway, extend only starts to become useful after you reach Cleric 6 at the very least, but really really useful after Cleric 9, so you can delay Extend spell and take Blind Fight earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\n3- I believe it'd be a good idea to delay that first Fighter level, so that you can get your buffs up and running ASAP. You can take it after you get Cleric 9. Improved Expertise won't be that useful early on, at least not where I usually play. If it is where you play, then keep it that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n4- Skill-wise, I would go for a higher Disable Trap and a lower Open Lock. Here's why: There are Thieves' Tools, which are items used SPECIFICALLY to open locks, and they go up to +10, PLUS you have Divine Trickery to increase your total even further if necessary. AND, finally, in order to RECOVER the traps you encounter in dungeons and use them against your enemies, you have to add +10 to the DC of disabling the trap. So DT needs to be as high as possible, while OL normally a couple of points are enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n5- Still in Skills, I would consider dropping a couple of Spellcraft points, maybe even 10, lowering your saves vs spells by 2 (but you have the Spell Resistance spell for 27 SR), and invest more in Rogue skills, such as Search to be able to find the traps (and secret doors, although I don't know if they exist where you play). <br/>\n<br/>\nBut these are all kind of minor tweaks. Other than that, it's a pretty good build. Why don't you tweak it and go ahead and post it in the lvl 20 forums?<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
