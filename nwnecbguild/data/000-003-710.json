End game mobs have so high AC that trying to concentrate on magic and melee will make you medicore in both aspect. There are many builds that concentrate on fighting like Cleric/Bard/RDD but few try to make clerics offensive spells as deadly as possible. From what I've observed mostly used of them are - harm, bladebarrier and most importantly - implosion.\u00a0 That decided about choosing spell schools - evocation and necromancy. To be effective in team and heal\u00a0 party members, a cleric should stay alive by himself. To do it as long as possible I've decided to mix him with 16 lvl of Pale Master for AC bonus, crit immunity, surpsine attack immunity and\u00a0 2 epic spells - epic mage armour and epic warding. I am aware that there are few such a combos in the base:\u00a0<br/>\nPriestess of the Damned\u00a0bard 4 / cleric 20 / pale master 16\u00a0(human)\u00a0by I...Samphus<br/>\n(Kiaransalee Drow Cleric)\u00a0cleric 18 / bard 4 / pale master 18\u00a0(elf)\u00a0by Nekroskop_<br/>\nCombat Medic\u00a0cleric 20 / bard 4 / pale master 16\u00a0(human)\u00a0by Halston Vega<br/>\nThe Robust Reanimator\u00a0cleric 20 / bard 4 / pale master 16\u00a0(dwarf?)\u00a0by jjjhhhlll<br/>\nAnother Lite-Can Cleric!\u00a0cleric 20 / bard 4 / pale master 16\u00a0(human)\u00a0by krsboss<br/>\nArcher Cleric\u00a0cleric 20 / pale master 16 / bard 4\u00a0(human)\u00a0by Tilbono<br/>\nbut none of them focuses on magic power.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is my little project.

A 44 DC Implosion is more powerful than any of your necromancy spells and your high level slots can be filled with other spells like Blade Barrier or Harm. Replace the pre-epic focuses with Silent Spell and Empower Spell. Silent Spell lets you fill both your level 6 and 7 slots with Harm, I take it on almost all of my clerics. I would swap ESF: Necro and Armor Skin for another 2 G WIS feats. With that you will have 44 WIS when fully buffed which gives you an extra level 9 spell slot (so one more Implosion) and +1 DC.<br/>\nMove SPen and GSPen to level 1, Extend Spell to level 3, and move SF: Evo and GSF: Evo to level 6 and level 9 respectively.<br/>\nMove ESF: Concentration to level 21 and ESF: Evocation to level 24, you can move the G WIS feats to later levels.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I didn't bother about dispells because some late game mobs have weapons with Holy avenger feat that take off all buffs anyway with one shot :(. I have a battle cleric 39 there that is getting stripped off and has to hide behind warriors all the time. My new cleric will be focused on healing and those few offensive spells. It is a team oriented characted so I din't care also about melee aspect. I chose necro school talent thinking, that it would make Harm spell more difiicult to resist. I didn't\u00a0 know that it doesn't make any difference on spell DC.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">There is a lot of overlap between epic spell: mage Armor and cleric spells.  This does not invalidate a 16 PM attachment to a primary cleric build but it why people often go the 26 cleric / 10 PM / 4 bard route.  So you net the PM class feats but not the epic spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nA deep cleric CL build helps spell penetration, spells last longer of course and a deep cleric build nets the cleric epic bonus feats for +Wis which is your DC.  You can get to 52 Wis (capped) easish on a caster build.  Add a Monk level to make it all AC applicable.<br/>\n<br/>\nA high CL cleric also nets a high Spell Resistance (12+CL), so a 40th level cleric has a 52 SR.  Or, more typically, a 38 Cleric has 50 SR.  Not enough to stop a dedicated caster, but enough to stop all the hybrid casters.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are keen on a high DC caster cleric, I suggest taking a look at the Demolition build and altering it to meet your needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If the mobs hit very hard it might be tempting to switch to a CON focused Cler26/Bard4/PM10, you can get EDR3 and also pick up elemental resistances if elemental damage is a problem.
