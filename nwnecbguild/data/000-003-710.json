The Enchant Arrow feat gives +1 AB and +1 damage every second level. That makes it possible to make a viable AA build even with no (or almost no) investments in dexterity (or wisdom for Zen). That opens up for builds with focus on full strength for dev crit and high mighty damage or full charisma for DM, DS and other divine feats. To make such builds work you must take enough AA levels for the AB to become high enough.<br/>\nTaking many AA levels also gives epic bonus feats for EWF, EP and Great dexterity. This let you take more Great charisma (or Great strength for strength builds) on general feats.<br/>\nThe difference between a Paladin 15/wizard 1/ AA 24 and Paladin 9/ wizard 1/AA 30 illustrates this point.<br/>\nPaladin 15 grants +5 AB and damage on Divine favor. Paladin 9 only gives a +3 bonus. So adding 6 levels of Paladin grants a +2 bonus for a limited number of times per day. 6 levels of AA on the other hand add +3 AB and damage to every arrow all day long. And the AB bonus from Enchant arrow does not even count towards the +20 AB bonus cap.<br/>\nAA 30 also grants 5 epic bonus feats instead of the 3 you get from AA 24.<br/>\nPaladin 15 (or 16 in your build) gives a better spell book than 8 or 9 levels do. But you have to invest in wisdom for it to work. And the Paladin spell book is better for a melee character.<br/>\nDon't get me wrong. Paladin 16 makes for a good build. I just wanted to show what can happen when you try to min/max with a focus on divine damage.</div>",
