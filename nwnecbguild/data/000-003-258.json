      "content": "<div>Hello All,<br/>\n<br/>\n This is the problem with me being stymied in my current game: I start thinking about other stuff. To be fair, some of you are partially to blame because of your interesting builds in the OC!<br/>\n<br/>\n What I'd like is a strength-based monk build (predominantly), with some bardic abilities (singing, mostly) and maybe some RDD if that adds to toughness (just had a thought - I have no idea what Purple Dragon Knight does - any merit?). Unarmed would be a preference, but I couId live with kamas. Had contemplated some druid, but I decided I'm too old to learn spell-chucking now.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm not intending to begin with the OC: maybe SoU ('cause I've never played it from L1), or another module (happy to take recommendations) I've never played before. I'll probably try to solo it, if poss, and I'm not bothered about race/gender/goodness (although I still can't get my head around playing evil, so I'd rather not do that), because Aribeth won't be an issue. I know from reading other builds you've posted that Dwarf is well-liked, but perhaps half-orc is a possibility? If so, I'll probably go as a bloke, because if I'm going to girl it up I want to be drop-dead-gorgeous, superficial git that I am.<br/>\n<br/>\n This is not me just asking out of boredom: I've only played a 'pure' monk before (up to L28-ish), but have been inspired by some of Empyre's OC build - and Monsieur le Dagger's bard seems to be doing great things. So, this is a build I'd really like to take to L40.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks in advance.</div>",

      "content": "<div>Thanks, Mick. Have had a look at Kail'sDragon Claw, which looks almost perfect, except too much bard - I don't want spells - hence my dropping interest in partial druidity (word?). I had a look at the other one of the two related builds on the link (Fallen Monk of the Red Scale was the other, but that was way too much Bard for me), and it just didn't seem to gel properly in my head.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm a damn nuisance to myself as well as others, but I can't help but think that there should be a way for a non-armoured, non-weaponised character to buff him/herself with a tune or two when wading in. Maybe a more simplistic Monk/RDD build would be the way to go, and I'd just hum quietly to myself to no discernible effect.<br/>\n<br/>\n It would be a shame, though, to lose bard - I'm only just beginning to appreciate it, thanks to you running it 'pure' in the OC. I'm just not brave enough. I suppose I'm after a Friar Tuck sort - who's a monk, hardly very lawful, but full of bonhomie and joy.<br/>\n<br/>\n Stagmeister - aka Pain-in-the-posterior</div>",

      "content": "<div>I hope your problem will be fixed soon Stagmeister. Now, before we go to the build part i would like to mention a couple of things if you would like to hear them,<br/>\n<br/>\n a) Monks and Bards do not mix well, that is because they require an alighnment change (or several) and you are not guaranteed to have access to that. Now, you will see some builds that do have an alighnment change here but we usually try to not mix different things like that, exactly because we do not know how easy this will be for the player. Usually when we do that, it is for some build requests that specifically state that their persistent world allows for these changes.<br/>\n<br/>\n b) You have to understand that the O.C/ SOU/ HoTU and Aribeth's Redemption are all Monty Haul's campaigns. They are all <strong>very high magic</strong> environments that forgive mistakes and simplified builds. The ECB builds on the other hand, are best suited for <strong>low-to-medium magic</strong> environments ( that is a generalization, it is not true for all of the builds) that you will have to build-up an advantage through your builds abilities and clever play-style. To give you an example of this, think of your character in Aribeth's Redemption module, he has access to some really powerful magic items like rings of improved evasion, belts of greater guiding light, amulets of greater health, helmets that grand you mind-effects immunitiy and an elven forge that will add haste as a property of your weapon to name a few. In other quality modules like Adam Miller's \" Shadowlords, Dreamcatcher and Demon Campaigns \" or Tiberius \" Saleron's Gambit \" you won't find anything like that, and the same is true for some of the best Persistend Worlds out there, whereas +5 items are considered to be top of the line.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, you will be asking yourself, \"why the heck should i care for all these\" ? The answer is simple, your RDD's acquired ability to be totally immune to fire means little in any module that you can just purchase a ring of elemental resistance, or the Rogue's \" improved evasion \" means nothing if you can have this as a property of your armour. Generally a good build will always be a good build even with those parameters in play simply because they also have other abilities that are useful, like RDD's immense +8 strength bonus, but the higher the magical environment is, the less the usefulness of a really good build will be.<br/>\n Keeping this information in mind and your request, i would suggest you start playing some quality modules that are not high magic so you can enjoy the benefits of your builds all the more. This will add value and high replay-ability to the game, wondering what compination of classes you should try next.<br/>\n<br/>\n Here is my suggestion if you want to try something different from what you play now, it is a self-installed complete campaign, just an *exe file that you click on it and you are done. I will advice you not to play as a Monk here however, a Fighter or Paladin or even Bard are better suited for this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"color:#0000CD\">Adam Miller's campaign</span></strong> =&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/module/shadowlords-dreamcatcher-and-demon-campaigns\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn ... -campaigns</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ~ Ah..

If you don't like to use spells, then don't! They wiill be there in case you need them but the song will always be available. It will be a shame to not get those wonderful bonusses of the Bard's song cause you don't like the spells that come with it unconditionally. Baby steps, one at a time..<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, if you are looking for a Monk with some dragon's blood in him that fights unarmed then i will suggest this one unless Empyre has done an improvement since then that wants to share it with us,<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build225446.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">[url=</a><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build293884.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 93884.html</a><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build293577.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">]</a><span style=\"color:#0000CD\"><strong>Order Of the Wyrm</strong></span>[/url]<br/>\n<br/>\n For Adam Miller's campaign and if you are looking for a good type of hero then consider the alternatives of paladin, barbarian and ranger. The fighters aren't the only ones easy-to-play characters that have a full base attack bonus and good hit points. Think Conan (barbarian), Aragorn (banger) and Arthur Pendragon (paladin) as the stereotypes of them. I usually find playing a barbarian or a ranger as fighters, far more entertaining that playing the classic old fighter because of the additional abilities and more skill points. We can help you with this if you want some suggestions.</div>"

Monk (25) and RDD (14) both gain from (1) bonus epic feats (armour skin and epic prowess) and you need only (1) sorcerer or bard level to enter the RDD prestige class.

Probably i will do both, he he..<br/>\n<br/>\n Stagmeister, i hope someone confirms that and you will be able to finish Aribeth's trilogy, i am almost sure it is the CEP thingy.

      "content": "<div>@ Empyre,<br/>\n<br/>\n What you listed was a <strong>tool </strong>for making builds, Stagmeister i think is interested in the mental process that's involved in the making of a build, a.k.a \"tips\".<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Stagmeister,<br/>\n<br/>\n What's involved in making a successful build is different from one person to the other but there is one point that almost everyone agrees. You need to know the rules, the better you know them, the more you can understand the synergies between the classes. The \"NWN Wiki\" is a powerful tool, consult it whenever you can. Then you need to have an clear \"idea\" for what you want to make, decide the class or classes you want inside your build and then start transfer them to \"paper\" and set the order of them. Once you have them set, start putting your feats inside, make sure everything is eligible for taking. Then after you finish the first draft of your build, look at it again and now see if you would change anything or if you can improve upon something. If so, then do it. If something is particularly difficult then take a break and come at it at a later time.<br/>\n<br/>\n When you have the finished build in your hands (Hard Drive, Whatever) then post it here in this section of the forums and let us wail upon it. Chances are that your first build won't be very strong and it could take some improvements, but the next one you try will be better. Here is something critical, do not get disheartened if you made some mistakes, keep persisting and you will win. My advice would be to make a \"pure\" build first, whatever you are most comfortable with, then as you are getting more familiar with the process then start making more complicated builds. Do not frown upon the \"pure\" builds as some do, there is a huge difference between an average pure build and one that is well-made and if you look upon the \"Yardstick Builds\" thread you will discover some really \"mean monsters\" inside. Another critical thing is to get your hands \"dirty\" and start trying some ideas, how would you build Mazzy for example? She is a plain fighter or so it seems, but she is a Halfling and she is dual-wielding her tiny blades. You instantly know that, this means you will need at least 15 DEX in your build, set your stats accordingly and proceed. If you want her to do some serious damage then you need to take her STR high, as high as you can propably, for a Hin, make that your priority and move on. Then you start to formulate some ideas in your mind, what can i do with so many feats? Shall i make her an expert with a Bow as well (she is a master, in BG2)? Can i push there some saving boosters in the general feat levels? Then after you finish her build, look at it again and think. Maybe i should give her \"blind fight\" earlier or IKD in that matter, what should i put first so to make the build level more easily? And it goes on from there..<br/>\n<br/>\n Whatever you decide man, i want you to know that we are here to help, that's all.<br/>\n<br/>\n Best of luck with your first build(s) and i want you to know that it feels somewhat special when you play your very own build ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n ~ You point - I punch!<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

I know you'll probably think this is all just common sense, but as a staff trainer once told me, \"the thing to remember about common sense is that it's not that common.\" Oh, and I'll be doing it on paper first - keeping it real and old-school, if that's what the kids are still calling such things.<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Empyre: Blimey, the damage the little girl is currently doing is startling. I'm still struggling with how best to clothe and arm her. At the moment (at level 22) she's in Higher Adventurer's Robes (+3 soak 10 damage) and Cloak of Fortification +5, Dex gauntlets +4, Boots of Sun Soul +4, Cowl of Warding hat (no mental attacks), Amulet of natural armour +5, Rings of Bone (no level/ability drain) and Resistance +3. I've maintained her speed by having Peasant Dynasty hasted (as well as acidified, given strength drain on hit, keen, and boosted to +4 at the moment). My other +4 Kama has the strength drain property on it as well, and will be replacing Thread of Life soon, when I can afford the regeneration addition from Rizolvir. I'm also lugging around some Hin Fist +7 mittens just in case.<br/>\n<br/>\n And therein lies my problem. I'm used to playing unarmed monk wherever I can, and I've started using Kamas now, and wearing stuff that wouldn't fit, so I'm getting a bit twitchy I suppose.

I can hit anything hard and have an AC of 43, oh poor me.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm also trotting around with a Crossbow of Murder and 99 fire bolts (your tip, thanks).

To be honest, I cheated by loadeing my character into the Pretty Good Char Creator between HotU and Sands of Fate, and made myself a bow with all the features that Risolvr would put on a melee weapon, except replacing 2d6 elemental damage with infinite fire arrows. If you don't want to do that, you will be better off with more than 1 stack of fire bolts (5 or 6 should do). In addition to quite a few green slimes, there are a few black puddings that also try to dissolve your weapon (I hope I remember correctly which ooze it was that did that).<br/>\n<br/>\n You gear does transfer to Sands of Fate, unless you choose a skill level higher than Normal. At Hardcore or higher, you only keep what you have equipped. The module itself will warn you about that.</div>",

      "content": "<div>Thanks, Empyre. Am now wearing Fire Giant belt (STR+5) and Armour gauntlets+6, and have bought some more bolts (because I'll forget if I don't do it now). Level 24, STR 35, AC49 (helped by taking your tip about the second DEX point eariler and Peasant Dynasty kama having +2 DEX, giving me a DEX of 18). Unfortunately, Riz wouldn't upgrade my Peasant Dynasty any further (+2 Dex, enhanced to +4, keen, acid damage, strength reduction on hit and haste seemed to fill it), so I'm now using it in my offhand, with a kama +4 (enhanced to +6 at the mo, regenerating, keen, acid damage and strength reduction on hit) as my main weapon. Just in case I have to use my Hin Fists +7 (as I did against Soldalis and Vixthra, both of whom deaded me lots before I donned the gloves as an experiment), I've kept the Platinum Helm to maintain haste. (Note to self: remember to check out the Genie's store, he gets new stuff at some point.)<br/>\n<br/>\n Done the Undead, Beholders and Illithids in the Underdark, together with the Avariel. Off to Golem Island next - if it will let me - sometimes I seem to fall one quest short before the Seer calls me to battle. Might be something to do with how many times you return to Lith Myathar. Left the Golems 'til last because of those damn Adamantine ones who guard the demi-lich, and I wanted to be as tough as possible for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm prattling on now, so will go away. Thanks again.</div>",

      "content": "<div>You must not return to the city if you want to do all three quests. I don't remember the exacts but you first do the islands and then you go for the rest of the quests without returning to the city. Your weapons seem to be somewhat low on enchantmennts for HoTU standards (extremely high for elsewherre) something you didnt do well i suppose? Hmm you should have at least your main weapon to be (+10 keen, Acid 2d6, haste, Str-Drain, True-Sight, Regen+2, SR 22) but you wil find high magic stores in sands of fate too, they sell +12 swords at vendors there amongst other things. It helps if you apply the Str-Drain pearl <strong>after </strong>you have your weapons enchannted by Rizolvir though.</div>"

      "content": "<div>@ Valerfor - thou art not wrong. I think I've got it worked out now: do a bit of upgrading on arrival, then go off to do both of the islands - selling stuff to either my Genie or the Duergar on the Golem Island - then go back to Lith Myathar and have upgrades done before doing the 'mainland' quests all in one go, it should work. It has to be that way around (thereby getting a tougher time with the 2 hard-ass golems, but less so with the vampire and bony dragon) because the illithids need the mirror.<br/>\n<br/>\n This time around it all went horribly wrong, and meant I could either have the beholders or the golems. I went for golems 'cause the xp is greater there. I'm currently in Cania, which I absolutely despise - change this ring/that amulet/this shape/that glove - aargh! I could go back to a saved game before my first trip back to the Drow city (ie, after the Avariel) and do the whole thing again, but I'm getting weary. I'll see how I feel tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\n As to the upgrades: I think the knack is to have weapons that aren't already too enhanced in advance, which Peasant Dynasty is (forgot about the 5/resistances to everything except sonic and negative plane). Much as I'm enjoying playing this character, your monk build from the mage-killer thread - who I like to refer to as Blossom, sorry ;-) - wouldn't have the kama (or even karma) complications I'm currently undergoing. Hey-ho!<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, as a btw, I've put on all four items of Nasher's gear for the first time. I'm not sure exactly what it's done (I can see STR, DEX, AC and saves have gone up disproportionately) but it's bloody good! I'm thinking of keeping it for always (except when I have to swap things out in Cania, grumble, moan, complain).</div>",

There is also a quest to do in the Drow village itself, which will help in the big battle if you do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n You could abuse Nasher's gear for unlimited money. In Cania, equip the whole set, sell the cloak to Risolvr, and buy the cloak back for much less money than you sold it for. Repeat until you have as much money as you want. You could do the same with the merchant in the freed slaves village in the Underdark, but you make money more slowly there.</div>",
