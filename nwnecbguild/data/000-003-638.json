Polymorphs for situational usage (ie Water Elementals are mind immune, and petrify immune and can fight rust monsters without a care...)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere I take a Druid 28 / Bard 2 / RDD 10 split<br/>\nIt has a Str of 34, Base AB of 41 and 400 HP with a full 'undispellable Druid Spell Book, high Concentration/Discipline/Spot/Tumble 40/UMD 33/Spellcraft 30 mod etc.<br/>\nWith the Weapon Proficiency Druid containing Scimitar, I take WF/EWF: Scimitar and IC/OC/Devastating Critical: Scimitar<br/>\nI give up any dream of Dragon Shape, the Wis 30+ requirement is just too expensive for me.<br/>\nI do use one bonus great wisdom feat from Druid 24 to access level 9 druid spells which I viewed as a small trade off for a 'spellblade' to free up an extra epic feat but one can obviously adjust this to taste (ie if you want faster Druid 9 spells then get an extra point of wis early and change epic fort or epic prowess for great strength, for example.<br/>\n<br/>\nDruids have great stat capping abilities in Bull's, Blood Frenzy, Aura of Vitality. One could swap Craft wand or Heavy Armor for Extend Spell in the build if desired.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of previous Druid / Bard / RDDs there are two builds total I could find in the ECB Archives (two) and ECB Filter Search (none):<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build142549.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Morphea Draca</a>\u00a0druid 22 / bard 8 / red dragon disciple 10\u00a0(human?)\u00a0by sketchy_c<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build199235.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A Quite (devastating) Critical Dragon</a>\u00a0druid 29 / bard 1 / red dragon disciple 10\u00a0(half-orc?)\u00a0by Dennis05<br/>\n<br/>\nOne doesn't work as Dragons have creature weapons and cannot dev crit.

Druid/Monk rules out RDD. RDD has +8 Str (+4 AB +4DMG +4 Dev Crit DC), +2 Con (+1 Fort, +40hp), +4 AC, Fire Immunity its great as always.<br/>\n<br/>\nDruids do have some great spells, such as Stonehold/Grease/Entangle/SoV which disables and can destroy Dex/Tumble/Dodge AC for maybe -10 to -20 AC to opponents? Haven't done the math here but I believe it will be quite effective.\u00a0<br/>\nBasically I am making a build which enemies have to fight the Druid with dev crit in his own powerful environmental pit at the cost of spell DC/Wisdom which is capped by Owl's Insight anyway.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n28 CL means 85% chance of beating max toolset SR 32, the loss of CLs is fine with a dev crit scimitar druid with Base 41 AB, you get something else in exchange. It looks exciting to me.<br/>\nI did try a close to pure druid/fighter/rogue version of this build but the AB just ends up around 38-39 unless one goes half-orc which had other costs involved<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 1 point in AE is for Take 20 cheese to control certain wildlife, also there are gloves of animal empathy if you do want to use it in combat, it opens this up. you can drop it if you want<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The creature will remain dominated for one turn per level of the character using the skill. </li>\n</ul>\n</div></blockquote>\n\nSo it really depends on what one is facing in the environment as to how much to invest (also, what sort of Cha increasing stuff one has access to, and of course Animal Empathy skill increasing items, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe \"highest\" animal summons is of course the Dire Tiger with 16 HD.\u00a0 So that would be a DC of 15+16=31.\u00a0 This is normally a mark to aim for if one is only interested in grabbing an opponents summons to use against them (I think this will also work on Animal Companions and Familiars if animals or beasts or magical beasts, but may require even a higher skill level).<br/>\n<br/>\nDepending on the environment, one may really want to pump it as high as possible to get the best possible murder beast.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's take, for example, a Giant Cave Bear, a murderous weapon of mass destruction.\u00a0 It has 30 HD for this example.\u00a0 So as a normal Animal, it has a DC of 15+30=45.\u00a0 <br/>\n<br/>\nMagical Beasts, like Ankhegs would use the DC of 19+HD, of course.\u00a0 Or Purple Worms...<br/>\n<br/>\n\"You talking to me?\u00a0 Talk to the Worm first!

Or Discipline, but that protects against disarms/called shots and helps resist knockdowns if you don't have Knockdown Immunity.<br/>\nPerhaps a future build I can put in a modified 31 Animal Empathy<br/>\nI'll leave it at 1 though, just in case there are some uber AE gloves or something in the environment you are in, with possibly a bard buffing you.\u00a0<br/>\nI understand the skill cap is +50 so there is a bit of leeway<br/>\n<br/>\nBuild is very easy to play btw.

Some might say it is fruitless to give ESF to a character with base 20 WIS but I disagree with this -one size fits all- approach.\u00a0 You see, Stonehold is a Will saving throw AoE save-or-suck spell &amp; for most melee monsters this is their weakest point by far, even on epic levels. Your max Stonehold DC (33) will destroy them with ease &amp; you will be running through them &amp; dev -crit, after dev-crit, after dev-crit...
