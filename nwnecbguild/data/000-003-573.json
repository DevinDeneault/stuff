Small size with gnome means he or she can stand in a field of self-cast Evard's Black Tentacles without any danger.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is +11 to saves vs spells, add Protection versus Spells (+8) and the +20 save cap is almost hit without any items (+19).<br/>\nIE: Expect Fort 42, Will 42, Reflex 35 versus spells and spell like abilities. Dev Crit, Sneakers particularly with Death Attack, and Traps are gaps in this builds defenses, along with some duration spells like Grease which don't use saves vs spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpell focus Evocation was tempting for better DC on firebrand and sunburst and chain lightning, but I thought more value was obtained with conjuration, and better Flame arrows (flame arrow can fill 3, 4, 5 and 6, Max Icestorm 7, and IGMS 8 and 9.<br/>\n<br/>\nAuto-still spell could have been put in the build, swapping silent for still, great int x3 for autostill I-III and great int x1 for mummy dust or greater ruin, but I didn't like the -4 Int for less spells and less DC, plus there is something nice about 50 Int. If there is spellsword equipment even better :)<br/>\n<br/>\nForbidden school is Divination: Premonition, Find Traps and True Seeing will be missed. Remove blindness as well, but restoration scrolls and wands could be used instead.\u00a0<br/>\nSome environments have these spells on items.\u00a0<br/>\nThere is a crummy skill dump into discipline at level 40 (I don't really like the level 40 skill dumps) but one can swap that with something else like appraise if one wishes, or more heal.\u00a0<br/>\nSpot is chosen over listen, because one needs to 'spot' enemies to target them with spells. Listened enemies are not enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nRE Wizard 38 and Ranger 1 were obvious choices in terms of power, the last level I had a few options:\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Cleric - animal domain, healing domain, heavy armor prof\nMonk - Evasion, Discipline and Tumble dump (quite late)\nPalemaster 1 - for +2 AC, skill dumps, more fort save pre-epic\n</details>\n\nI settled on cleric for lovely RP factor and stronger summons.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway here is the build draft:<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Necromancer(38), Cleric(1), Ranger(1), Gnome (Human or Elf can also work)\nAny alignment, Evil if possible (to cast prot v evil on yourself to protect yourself and your evil minions from those noxious clouds that you will emit)\n\nDEX: 8\nWIS: 8\nCHA: 8\nGnome: (Defensive Training vs. Giants, Hardiness vs. Enchantments, Low-light Vision, Offensive Training vs. Goblinoids, Offensive Training vs. Reptilians, Skill Affinity: Concentration, Skill Affinity: Listen, Small Stature, Spell Focus: Illusion)\n02: Cleric(1): Domain Animal, Domain Healing\n04: Necromancer(3): INT+1, (INT=19)\n06: Necromancer(5): Craft Wand, Spell Focus: Conjuration\n08: Necromancer(7): INT+1, (INT=20)\n10: Necromancer(9)\n12: Necromancer(11): INT+1, Maximize Spell, (INT=21)\n14: Necromancer(13)\n16: Necromancer(15): INT+1, Greater Spell Focus: Necromancy, (INT=22)\n18: Necromancer(17): Silent Spell\n20: Necromancer(19): INT+1, (INT=23)\n22: Necromancer(21)\n24: Necromancer(23): INT+1, Great Intelligence I, Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor, (INT=25)\n26: Necromancer(25)\n28: Necromancer(27): INT+1, (INT=28)\n30: Necromancer(29): Great Intelligence IV, Great Intelligence V, (INT=30)\n32: Necromancer(31): INT+1, (INT=31)\n34: Necromancer(33)\n36: Necromancer(35): INT+1, Great Intelligence VII, Great Intelligence VIII, (INT=35)\n38: Necromancer(37)\n40: Ranger(1): INT+1, Epic Spell Focus: Illusion, {Dual Wield}, (INT=38)\nHitpoints: 330\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 22/22/15\nBAB: 19\nAC (naked/mundane items only): 14/24\nAlignment Changes: 0\nAnimal Empathy 43(42), Concentration 43(49), Craft Trap 7(21), Disable Trap 8(24), Discipline 43(43), Heal 29(28), Lore 10(24), Open Lock 1(0), Search 25(39), Set Trap 14(15), Spellcraft 42(56), Spot 43(46), Tumble 20(19)\n\n02: Concentration(1), Craft Trap(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(2),\u00a0\n04: Concentration(1), Craft Trap(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Spot(1),\u00a0\n06: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Spot(1), Save(2),\u00a0\n08: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n10: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Set Trap(5),\u00a0\n12: Concentration(1), Disable Trap(2), Heal(1), Spot(1),\u00a0\n14: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Search(3),\u00a0\n16: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(7),\u00a0\n18: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Set Trap(3),\u00a0\n20: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n22: Concentration(1), Disable Trap(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(4),\u00a0\n24: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Search(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n26: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Search(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(11),\u00a0\n28: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(17),\u00a0\n30: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(35),\u00a0\n32: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(55),\u00a0\n34: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(76),\u00a0\n36: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(98),\u00a0\n38: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(112),\u00a0\n40: Animal Empathy(43), Concentration(1), Discipline(43), Search(16), Set Trap(5), Spot(34),\u00a0\n</details>\n\nThere are <strong>no</strong> Wizard / Cleric / Ranger builds in the ECB Archives Search or DPA's ECB Guild Filter search.\u00a0<br/>\nI also did a tapatalk forum search, as well as a google search (\"site:<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/</a> cleric ranger wizard\" AND \"cleric ranger wizard nwn\") and found no relevant<strong>\u00a0</strong>results.<br/>\nSo to me this could to be a unique build that has never been investigated before.

The evasion and AC is great from Monk it was tough to say no to it! this time am hoping to be out of the middle of battles sitting in the back, so to speak so hopefully the trifocus pays off.<br/>\nI didn't choose illusionist as enchantment was prohibited, and I wanted to try out dominate monster a bit. Hold Monster is a great spell too, I have been using this a lot. Curious if I can have a summon, dominate a monster, have a familiar and use animal empathy? 4 minions :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Is it wrong of me to say \"disposable minion\"?<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously, charm an enemy with Animal Empathy, send it in against a group of things and drop AoE on their heads... repeatedly, if needed.
