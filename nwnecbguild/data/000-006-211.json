      "content": "<div>This build drew it's inspiration from not one but two of Mick's builds, i am referring to the \" <em>Feat Master</em> \" and the \" <em>Brawler Champion</em> \" of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n I wanted a party-tank that can really stand his ground and take full-force the enemy's blows without even flinching and repay them with his own devastating blows. I said i wanted a party-tank because if i wanted a soloing-tank i would rather prefer something with rogue inside like my \" <em>Dwarven Warmaster</em> \", but once you have someone to buff you, then monk is the better choice and that's why it is here. Strong, very strong saves, rock-solid hit-points, a carapace able to shrug-off most lesser blows, good ac that becomes even better with the use of his myriad combat feats and full evasive capabilities from monk will keep this Dwarf alive and kicking long after everyone else is down to the ground. And this build sacrifices nothing in terms of playability to achieve that, solid from the beginning to the end with no gaps, no thrills, just pure combat value that goes on and on...

      "content": "<div>This is a very solid build. This character won't flinch if a brute swings his axe or a necromancer wails like a banshee!<br/>\n<br/>\n My old Feat master build started out as an experiment to see what could be done with all the feats a fighter gets during leveling up. I soon swapped\u00a0 some fighter levels for CoT 10 for the free bonus to saves without losing any feats. I realized that fighters get enough combat bonus feats to let you ignore combat feats on the general feats completely. That\u00a0 allows one to add feats that improve saves, skills, stats and other things. With the lvl 20 build Brawler champion I introduced a couple of monk levels for free cleave and evasion and to get tumble as a class skill. Pre epic monk also bolsters the saves with all three F/W/R as primary saves.<br/>\n<br/>\n You have taken 10 levels of monk here and take 8 of them pre epic and the remaining levels for epic skill dumps. You get cleave and improved knockdown pre epic from monk, and later you get improved evasion. You pick feats that improve saves and hitpoints pre epic and strength during epic levels. 8 pre epic levels of monk help improve the saves all over and leaves room for 9 epic bonus combat feats from CoT and fighter.<br/>\n You manage to get str 30 and con 22 with EDR 9/-. You have dev crit and all relevant combat feats for bastard sword including all AB enhancing feats. You get Armor skin, and even Improved expertise.<br/>\n The saves are extraordinary. The hitpoints are high. You get a tank that can shrug off both physical and magical attacks, and withstand severe damage when hit.<br/>\n<br/>\n If you ignore EDR , and if you take less monk, preferably all in epic levels, then this build can get +4AB and reach +46. That will give more devastating critical hits and generally a more aggressive warrior. But you know how to make such characters, and I know that is not your goal here. If I should add a tweak or two, it would be to keep expetise, but forget about Improved expertise, since that will drop your AB to +32. If you also drop WP exotic, you can afford the disarm feats. I am tempted to ignore the trap skills and take spot or a cross classed taunt instead.<br/>\n<br/>\n You have taken my builds one step further and succeeded in building a very solid party tank that can sustain some serious hardship and still be dangerous enough to attract the attention away from more fragile party members.</div>",

      "content": "<div>Thanks for the input Mick,<br/>\n<br/>\n As you said in your post my goal was indeed to create a defensive warrior-tank that can absorb many hits while still pose a significant threat to his opponents. Monk was ideal for the job and it fitted perfectly to this class mixture, while being also different from the usual rogue fits. For those however that don't want a Dev. Critical FMS (Full Metal Soldier) and want something different than the easy solution of replacing the aforementioned feats with two of Epic Toughnesses, here is a slightly different version that boosts even more his saving throws and takes also the Improved Disarm feats.<br/>\n<br/>\n FULL METAL SOLDIER:<br/>\n (FTR 12/ MONK 10/ COT 18)<br/>\n<br/>\n RACE: DWARF<br/>\n ALIGNMENT: TN (Smite Proof)<br/>\n PLAYABILITY: PvM 1 \u2013 40<br/>\n<br/>\n STARTING/ ENDING STATS:<br/>\n STR -\u00a0 17 (<strong>30</strong>)<br/>\n DEX -\u00a0 09<br/>\n CON - 18 (<strong>22</strong>)<br/>\n INT -\u00a0\u00a0 14<br/>\n WIS - 08<br/>\n CHA - 06<br/>\n<br/>\n DR: 9/ \u2013<br/>\n Hit Points: 660<br/>\n<br/>\n Skill Points: 198\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Concentration: 41 (47)<br/>\n Disable Traps: 5 (9) cc<br/>\n Discipline: 43 (53)<br/>\n Set Traps: 14 (15) cc<br/>\n Spellcraft: 18 (20) cc<br/>\n Tumble: 40 (39)\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fort/Ref/Will): 44/ 34/ 30 \u2192<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fort/Ref/Will): 50/ 40/ 36 (saves Vs spells)<br/>\n<br/>\n Naked/ Armoured AC: 19/ 30 (Full Plate and Shield)<br/>\n Armoured AC with Cat's Grace and Expertise: (<strong>37</strong>)<br/>\n<br/>\n BAB: 28 (Four Attacks)<br/>\n AB: +42/ +37/ +32/ +27 (Dwarven WarAxe)<br/>\n DMG: 1D10 +16/ 19 \u2013 20x3 (Dwarven WarAxe)<br/>\n<br/>\n LEVELING GUIDE:<br/>\n 01) Monk (01): Luck Of Heroes, <em>Cleave, Evasion</em><br/>\n 02) Monk (02):<br/>\n 03) Fighter (01): WF: Dwarven WarAxe, WP: Exotic Weapons<br/>\n 04) Fighter (02): Expertise, {STR +1}<br/>\n 05) Fighter (03):<br/>\n 06) Fighter (04): WS: Dwarven WarAxe, Blind Fighting<br/>\n 07) Monk (03): <em>Still Mind</em><br/>\n 08) Monk (04): {STR +1}<br/>\n 09) CoT (01): Great Fortitude<br/>\n 10) CoT (02): IC: Dwarven WarAxe<br/>\n 11) Monk (05): <em>Purity Of Body</em><br/>\n 12) Monk (06): Iron Will, <em>Improved Knockdown, </em>{STR +1}<br/>\n 13) CoT (03):<br/>\n 14) CoT (04): Disarm<br/>\n 15) CoT (05): Lightning Reflexes<br/>\n 16) CoT (06): Improved Disarm, {CON +1}<br/>\n 17) Monk (07):<br/>\n 18) CoT (07): Toughness<br/>\n 19) CoT (08): Power Attack<br/>\n 20) Monk (08): {CON +1}<br/>\n<br/>\n 21) Fighter (05): Great STR I<br/>\n 22) Fighter (06): EWF: Dwarven WarAxe<br/>\n 23) CoT (09):<br/>\n 24) CoT (10): Great STR II, EWS: Dwarven WarAxe, {STR +1}<br/>\n 25) Fighter (07):<br/>\n 26) Fighter (08): Armour Skin<br/>\n 27) Monk (09): Great STR III, <em>Improved Evasion</em><br/>\n 28) Fighter (09): {CON +1}<br/>\n 29) Fighter (10): EDR 3/ \u2013<br/>\n 30) CoT (11): Great STR IV<br/>\n 31) CoT (12):<br/>\n 32) CoT (13): {STR +1}<br/>\n 33) CoT (14): Great STR V, EDR 6/ \u2013<br/>\n 34) CoT (15):<br/>\n 35) CoT (16):<br/>\n 36) CoT (17): Great STR VI, {STR +1}<br/>\n 37) Monk (10):<br/>\n 38) CoT (18): EDR 9/ \u2013<br/>\n 39) Fighter (11): Great STR VII<br/>\n 40) Fighter (12): Epic Prowess, {CON +1}\u00a0</div>"

He also allows you to use monk gear such as the <em>famous sun soul boots</em>. The way this build is made you are far better with a plate mail and a shield, Monk here simulates the<em> sixth sense</em> of this Dwarven Hero which allows him to survive intact on the battlefield even in situations that would have dire consequences to him (improved evasion, full tumble ranks for more ac, better saves, e.t.c)</div>"
