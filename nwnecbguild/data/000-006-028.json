      "content": "<div>Hello again, mighty ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\nI come to you with one of the last builds I posted back in the old guild, one I think was posted after they salvaged the builds when news of the forums closing reached us. I am not sure but I think you can't find it in that database. This build uses again the Cleric / Monk combo in a very playable way, combined with SD for HiPS and Epic Dodge. Trickery domain gives skill bonuses through divine trickery and 50% concealment. High AC from Cleric buffs and Monk Wisdom AC, very good buffed AB (63 at lvl 40), and really good playability. It's a very good tank, even though it doesn't have much HP. Monk speed gives a nice boost to your walking speed. The only thing that I wish I could change is getting KD and IKD sooner, but alas you can't have it all.

Go for Empower Spell to help cap the stats if you feel that your server doesn't have items to do this for you. Plant is taken because then you have access to Barskin and can use a periapt of wisdom to cap it. You mostly need to cap Wisdom and Dex for maximum effectiveness.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is very hard to level if you start from 1, so I decided to say it's playable from 2-40, but that 1st level is perfectly doable in party play. Just stay the hell away from any physical confrontation and you'll be fine. I was inspired by Yar Stardawg's build which also has a similar name. However, he goes with more metamagic feats, while this guy is all about kicking butt in melee. It made sense to me that it was so, since investing feats on metamagic with a 20 wisdom score didn't seem reasonable.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

DWing i'd have 10 attacks per round, as is I will have 8, and this build is tight on feats, so I can't get the DW feats without hurting the stats. If you want DW AS WELL AS Epic Dodge, you can do one of two things in this build:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- Drop Called Shot and 2 Great Dexterities, you will lose 1 AB and 1 AC (plus the -2 penalty for dual-wielding). I just think it's overkill for 2 extra attacks per round, but you can do it if you want. I only recommend it if you can afford the feats. This build as is can't without dropping epic feats.<br/>\n<br/>\n2- Go Cleric 26 Monk 1 Rogue 13 and drop the extra movespeed and HiPS, for Sneak Attack and UMD. It will have XP penalty, but won't need to get Dodge or Mobility, which are both SD requirements, then you can drop 1 BAB (you will have to take Monk 1 before 20 to get WF on Kamas, so no rule of 4 for you) and Called Shot to get the TWF feats. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn case what you meant here is if I would dual-wield WITHOUT the feats, no. I'd get a penalty to all my attack rolls for simply 1 extra attack. I consider that this penalty would make me miss on at least one attack I would otherwise hit without it. Not worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and glad you like it <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

It was a choice based on the fact that this guy doesn't really need to have 10 attacks per round because with Epic Dodge and 50% concealment, he can afford to stand in front of enemies more if needed, so I went for the higher AB and AC, but as I showed you, DWing feats are tweakable into the build if you want them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the shield, this build is different than my Magical Master. It starts out with Monk at level 1. A Shield would negate Monk AC bonus, so I play this one as a Monk right from the start, no shield. However, that first level can be ETERNAL without help. A Monk with 8 STR and no Weapon Finesse is SUFFERABLE. If you're gonna play this guy alone, I suggest you forfeit a few skill points and start out as Cleric to have summoning spells. That's as far as I know, the only way to make it playable from level 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have any other questions, I'd be happy to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

You should not have to change the build.<br/>\nYou only need Kxp to get to lvl 2, and you normally get a fair amount of xp per kill at lvl 1, so it should not take like forever.<br/>\nYou have 9 hp and AC is 16 (17 with dodge). You must be a little careful, but there is no need to give up, after all what you are up against is made for level 1 combat.<br/>\nIf you can afford potions, they are your friend. Cat's and owl's both give +1 or +2 to AC. And there are also potions of barkskin, bless, aid, bull's, endurance and healing in standard merchants to help you get by.<br/>\nTry to pick one enemy at the time if you can. Stealth (even with only 4 ranks and a +3 modifier) can help you position yourself strategically.<br/>\nYour single stunning fist attempt can save you in a pinch.<br/>\nYou have 3 attacks per round when you count in flurry and cleave!<br/>\n<br/>\nRanged combat with a heavy x-bow is a viable option. AB is determined by dex and damage is high enough to give many one hit kills at lvl 1. But be prepared to run and fire on the run to avoid attacks of opportunity against you.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also use the grenade weapons like alchemist fire, acid flask, choking powder, tanglefoot bags and caltrops to damage and slow your enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a last resort: In many mods you can run errands and earn xp and gold from simple non combat oriented quests.</div>",

In those environments you may not even afford a crossbow! Anyway, running errands is nice, getting henchmen in SP mods is also valid, but everything else is environment-dependant. So far, everywhere that I played (except WoG), I had to be levelled to lvl 2 by a friend.

      "content": "<div>Hip, once again, I wonder if I actually need to clarify anything with you having already been so ON THE SPOT! But I'll try to be more specific because the guy seems to not know even the basics, so it may help him.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, Rooky2k, let me try to enlighten you in reference to what we commonly refer to as CAP.<br/>\n<br/>\nReaching a CAP, when we talk about NWN, means reaching the maximum possible MAGICAL ENHANCEMENT of that particular base score. That applies to EVERYTHING in this game, but each different type of character feature has a different cap. Here is a rough list:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Ability scores: The cap for an ability score is +12 (+6 modifier, because you gain +1 modifier for every two additional points in any particular stat: 8 and 9 give -1 modifier, 10 and 11 give a 0 modifier, 12 and 13 give a +1 modifier, so on and so forth). When we talk about capped Wisdom in this build, for example, we mean the BASE score of 20 (+5 Modifier) enhanced magically through buffs and items to 32 (+11 modifier). It won't go beyond that. Multiple sources of this type of enhancement stack with one another, except for two identical spells (you shouldn't cast 2 owl's wisdom on yourself, as only the highest roll will work). But all different items that give you Wisdom will stack with one another, so a Periapt of Wisdom +3 and a Ring of Wisdom +5 will add +8 to your Wisdom score. If you cast an Owl's Wisdom spell on top of it all, you can reach the cap by rolling a 3 (the computer does the rolls automatically, so all you can do is keep your fingers crossed).<br/>\n<br/>\n- AB and AC: The cap for AB and AC is +20. AB is simple, as there is only one type of AB enhancement, although there are other enhancements that influence AB indirectly (like capping the combat stat, in this case DEX, which won't count towards the +20 cap). AB enhancements stack with one another, so GMW and Divine Favor will give +5 each to AB enhancement for a total of +10. If you add Divine Power, in this build it will give +5 to AB as well, so GMW + Divine Favor + Divine Power = +15 AB enhancement, so on and so forth.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, AC has 5 different types of modifiers, each of them with a +20 cap:<br/>\n<br/>\nNatural AC<br/>\nDeflection AC<br/>\nArmor AC<br/>\nShield AC<br/>\nDodge AC<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of the above, except for dodge, stack with themselves. So if you have a Ring of Protection +3 (+3 Deflection AC) and a Cloak of Protection +4 (+4 Deflection AC), it's the same as if you had only the cloak, only the highest value counts. Boots of Dodging and, say Divine Shield and Haste (both of which give Dodge AC), will stack to a maximum of +20. So the only way to cap your Deflection AC is to find a Cloak of Protection +20, and the same goes for all the other modifiers except Dodge AC. To cap Dodge AC, all you need to do is find several items / buffs that give you Dodge AC bonuses up to +20. <br/>\n<br/>\n- Skills: The cap for skill enhancements is +50. This only includes MAGICAL enhancements, so feats like Alertness, Skill Focus and such DON'T COUNT TOWARDS THE CAP.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope things are a bit clearer now. I know how painful it can be to be a member of the ECB whilst still being a noob, but don't worry, with that kind of attitude and curiosity, you're going to grow into a better player. I wish I could say soon, but this game is so complex that it'll probably take some time. Keep it up, though, don't give up!<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

This is pretty much a stealth build with SD cheese minus the sneak attacks.\u00a0 You can use a shield but then will lose the monk AC, WIS AC and monk move speed.\u00a0 Your decision.\u00a0 Robes are essential.\n<blockquote><div>\n What spells do you use? Rotation?<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n Don't know what you mean by \"rotation\".\u00a0 This is a self-buffer so your first priority are all the AB and damage boosts like Bless, Aid, Div Favor, Darkfire, GMW, Prayer, Battletide plus Div Power to exploit the free attack.\u00a0 Next priority comes your ability boosts like Bull STR, Cat DEX, Endurance.\u00a0 Next, all your defensive buffs like Death Ward, Magic Vest, Neg NRG Protect.\u00a0 After slotting all buffs, and if you have any spare slots, HotG &amp; WoF are handy vs. mobs.\u00a0 Flamestrike is a good slot if there is room.\n<blockquote><div>\n Is this build on for newbie?<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n If you are comfortable with exhaustive self-buffing, it's fine for a player of any flavour.\u00a0\n<blockquote><div>\n Any advice?</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">I recommend a few changes.\u00a0 Domain:\u00a0 I'd swap Plant out for either War or Animal.\u00a0 DEX is the primary AB ability so you need to buff that one and only a domain will enable Cat's Grace.\u00a0 Barkskin is handy but there are pots arounb so the difference in AC is not significant and Creeping Doom is very tough to use when you have hirelings or other party wandering around the combat zone. They will die in the cloud of gnats, usually before the enemy does.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n As handy as Called Shots are, the build's feat starvation precludes that choice because <em>Empower Spell</em> is an essential metamagic feat for self-buffing optimization and you'll need to fit it in at Level 9.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n At Level 27, swapping monk 7 for SD 2 gets you Uncanny Dodge at least.\u00a0 Max isn't dumping to discipline with monk so all the skills (detection, stealth, tumble) should work out the same. Monk 7 gains nothing worth striving for.<br/>\n<br/>\n I am assuming you will be playing this build through HotU as well.\u00a0 Epic Dodge will not be available.\u00a0 On this build, ED has been designed for a 40-cap server where players play their completed toons for extended periods for high-level questing.<br/>\n<br/>\n Usually, to find a plug 'n play type build for SoU-HotU, you should examine those optimized for Level 30.\u00a0 Even in that case, the last 2 levels will never be realized because HotU ends at Level 28, SoU around 12-14 ish.\u00a0 Unfortunately, most of our ECB mid-epic have been optimized for the Arelith server ATM. They could be considered but better optimized without those restrictive level-up rules and potential for XP penalties.\u00a0 There are also some mid-epic in the <strong><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2354480/How-and-Where-to-Access-Legacy-ECB-Archives\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#0000FF\">legacy archive</span></a></strong> you might like.<br/>\n<br/>\n Hopefully, all my deliberation fits into the category of \"Advice\" rather than \"Confusion\" and ends up making your decision easier.

For newbies, I generally recommend that you start with a melee guy, but if you, like me, want to challenge yourself, this build is not among the most difficult to play. I'd rank it as a mid-tier one in difficulty. This guy doesn't dual-wield kamas nor does he need to. You can start with a kama at level 1, but I normally use a henchman and sling the crap out of mobs to take advantage of the high dex modifier. As for tips in playing a Cleric, I would refer you to the game guides section, where you'll find my thorough guide that explains everything you need to know to master the art of playing Clerics.

Also, playstyle varies, so you may feel like you need to HiPS to stay alive. I played this build 1-40 on WoG and it was pretty much a cakewalk even without HiPS pre-epic. And WoG is known for having really tough bosses, but this guy is just so powerful that he literally wrecks everything in his path. Starting with Cleric and delaying the first Monk level will cause 2 things:<br/>\n<br/>\n 1- Fewer total skill points to the build due to the x4 multiplier at level 1. And I found him a bit skill-starved with 26 Cleric levels already. What did you remove from the skill set to start with Cleric?<br/>\n 2- Being more dispellable. On WoG, EVERY CASTER, arcane or divine, will cast some form of dispel on you, so being dispellable is a HUGE issue, especially since you're facing overlevel stuff most of the time (E.G. 2 bosses that you face at level 30 are level 40 bosses), which means higher caster levels and a higher chance of dispelling. They also cast Breaches and Mord's if they are arcane.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for the\u00a0TWF feats, you lose 3 AB and some indirect AC against STR attackers, and you gain 3 more (unnecessary?) attacks per round. If you ALWAYS HIT no matter what, then sure, go for it, but if the monster AC is competitive, the loss of AB may actually cause you to miss more and therefore be a waste in the end. What I thought when I chose not to try to go for\u00a0TWF was the following: you'll only need the two Kamas for really tough enemies, as everything else will die anyway, and against those, the loss of 3 AB was more of a hinderance than the gain I'd have from dial-wielding. You do kill things faster, but in my experience,\u00a0the things you kill faster would die anyway, so TWF feats don't actually affect the outcome of any battle. And I've been surrounded by 50-AB drow warriors and Drow Scouts with this guy without taking a single hit! So, have you tried to play this build without dual-wielding?<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><div>I'd sub in Empower for Called Shot and not have to think much about it. Unless it's a high-magic environment, a Dexer is going to need to buff up the STR in any way possible and the additional 40 HP wouldn't hurt either, nor the boost to saves, which are not bad but nothing to write home about. I assume Max was concerned about sources of AC ala Plant. CD is too buggy and party-unfriendly to focus towards so that's my best guess. I'd be more inclined towards Travel to empower my summons (and party, if applicable) with that 4 AC and free full BAB attack. Even War makes more sense to me for buffing the primary ability and benefits of AoV.</div></blockquote>\n\n Hey Hip! So, funny thing about Called Shot is that it's the ONLY optional feat in this build and I did have Empower Spell EXACTLY in that slot for this build to begin with. It's a very viable tweak, but let me tell you why I swapped it out: gear! Where I played it, combining gear and regular buffs, I was able to cap my STR score without Empower after a while, and you're severely underestimating what 7 attacks per round will do to the enemy's STR score with CS if you just spam it! I found CS to be more useful except for the beginning levels. Also, CS Leg can be very handy if you're sniping an enemy that you don't want to be able to chase you. With your Monk Speed and their slow, even if they're hasted (or on a horse) they won't be able to catch you :D.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for the choice of domain, the reason is the same: gear! When I played this guy on Aielund, I found myself desperately needing the Ammy slot to cap WIS, as there aren't that many items that have WIS-enhancing properties in other item slots,\u00a0so Barkskin actually provides me with extra Monk\u00a0AC, because I can get it from an Ioun Stone, from Owl's Wisdom and the Periapt of WIS +5 while still having a Natural +5 modifier from Cleric 13 onwards. Again, it all depends on the gear that is available where you play. And here's another funny thing LOL. I ended up HAVING TO SWITCH PLANT domain out when I made this guy on WoG\u00a0because of God Domain restrictions, so it ended up being War / Trickery in the end. The good thing about it is that you get 3 god modes a day in my spellbook configuration. AoV, Regeneration, Prayer and Battletide I only memorize 3 a day of each one (all extended, of course). Not that your ungodly mode is any less fearful, but it's nice to be regenerating, having more HP and doing slightly more damage for 52 turns 3x a day.<br/>\n<br/>\n But yeah, all of your suggested tweaks are very viable alternatives that IMO will depend on items that are available\u00a0where you play. Travel would certainly be a priority if I couldn't get perma-haste, so Trickery / Travel, Trickery / Plant or War / Trickery are all possible setups that will work very well with this build.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div></div>"

If you do that, then it wouldn't be this build. This build sort of has to wield a Kama to take advantage of Darkfire and Greater Magic Weapon. Too bad you can't buff Monk gloves with either, otherwise it'd be just a matter of weapon choice. However, this other build of yours could be really powerful too.\u00a0As a matter of fact I have made exactly that build (Monk 20 / Cleric 15 / Shadowdancer 5). It's called <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/521694/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bigbys-Small-Hand-Complex</a>. The first post contains a halfling version, a few posts down is a Human one.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n As for how much power you'd be giving up, it depends. You'd be foregoing undispellability, level 9 spells, some level 8 ones and a few spells per day on some circles, two epic feats and spell durations. For what? Unarmed damage, monk immunities, better saves and movespeed. As I said, it's just a completely different character that should be played completely differently. Moreso because you don't want to lose BAB, so you'll need to go Cleric 12 Monk 8 or Cleric 12 / Monk 4 / SD 4 pre-epic, which means you won't cap your main buffs until epic levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n Hope this helps!

I recall when I first saw Yar Stardawg's L20 version of this ... was a very powerful toon.<br/>\n<br/>\n I start with STR 10 and CON 10 ... so fewer Hp in the end, but better packing power early on as I also start with Cleric for the armor and shield. \u00a0I generally take Trickery (of course), and War (for Cat's Grace if perma haste is available on something other than boots) or Travel (for Haste if no perma Haste available on something other than boots ... as I like the Monk Boots AND Haste). \u00a0I pretty much stick with armor and shield until my Dex and monk skills allow my \"naked\" AC to catch up, at which point I go w/o armor and shield (for the better attack schedule). \u00a0I also took Still Spell instead of Called Shot ... allows more options with spells like Heal freeing up spots for extended battle buffs. \u00a0I pushed the second SD level to 23 just to get the Uncanny Dodge earlier, and rearranged some other classes to get C24 at L31 for the immunity to dispell (that was about as early as I could get it). \u00a0As for the skills ... I dropped Listen (as I have True Seeing) so added a bit of Detect Traps, Open locks, Search and even some Lore in the mix.<br/>\n<br/>\n I pack a pair of Gloves of the Ballanced Hands that I can don for an extra attack (-2 AB) with dual kamas ... nice if the kama's have enhancement (I really like the kama with Doom on it ....); else I just go with STR glove or DEX if you haven't maxed it with other gear.<br/>\n<br/>\n Any rate ... a very powerful toon, easy enough to optimize to fit the particular server being played on. \u00a0Thanks for posting.</div>"

Again, it all depends on the gear that is available where you play. And here's another funny thing LOL. I ended up HAVING TO SWITCH PLANT domain out when I made this guy on WoG\u00a0because of God Domain restrictions, so it ended up being War / Trickery in the end. The good thing about it is that you get 3 god modes a day in my spellbook configuration. AoV, Regeneration, Prayer and Battletide I only memorize 3 a day of each one (all extended, of course). Not that your ungodly mode is any less fearful, but it's nice to be regenerating, having more HP and doing slightly more damage for 52 turns 3x a day.<br/>\n<br/>\n But yeah, all of your suggested tweaks are very viable alternatives that IMO will depend on items that are available\u00a0where you play. Travel would certainly be a priority if I couldn't get perma-haste, so Trickery / Travel, Trickery / Plant or War / Trickery are all possible setups that will work very well with this build.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div>\n</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">\n Just curious which deity you went with on WoG because I cant seem to find one with War/Trickery that allows a lawful alignment.<br/>\n \u00a0</div></div>"

As the creator of the build, and having played him as both Unarmed and Kama, I'd say there isn't really much difference between both, except for the fact that I haven't seen any gloves with the Keen property on them, so you'd miss out on a few opportunities to score more criticals, but other than that, there's not really much of a difference. You need to remember that, as a DEX toon, most of your damage comes from buffs, so it's certainly nice to have the chance to multiply the extra damage from GMW, Battletide, Prayer and Divine Favor.

ED cannot be push earlier right?</div></blockquote>\n<br/>\nHeya! It is possible to anticipate Epic Dodge, but there's a catch. For every 5 levels, you'll lose 1 AC, because you need to take your last level in classes with Tumble (A.K.A. Monk and SD) at 37 to max out Tumble to 40. And each of these classes end up on a level which yields a requirement for Epic Dodge (Monk 9 gives Improved Evasion and SD 5 gives Defensive Roll). The last feat level before 39 is 36, so you'd need to take both 9 Monk and 5 SD by then, leaving no levels for your Tumble dump at 37. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a matter of personal style, I would say. I always build for Maximum Power at level 40, even if it means that I have to wait more for certain desired feats. I have never not been able to level a build because of these choices, even ones that look almost impossible to level on paper. And that's playing solo on WoG, which is a very challenging server. However, if you don't mind weakening the end result for earlier access to ED. It is doable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>",

What halfling would give, this build doesn't really need (more AB, more AC). What it would cost, IMO, is more than necessary. The feat is doable. You can, as mentioned, get rid of Called Shot. However, losing skill points for this guy would be devastating. He needs concentration to cast spells, Tumble for AC and hide and move silently for HiPS.

The way I see it, there are 5 domains that work well with this build:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- Trickery - This gives you access to Improved Invisibility, which means 50% concealment bonus to stack with your Epic Dodge and make you virtually unhittable by anything that's not an AA.<br/>\n<br/>\n2- War - War domain gives you Cat's Grace as a level 2 spell, which Clerics otherwise don't have, and Aura of Vitality, which if cast after Divine Power, will cap your Strength at 20 (if you go Halfling or Gnome this doesn't apply).<br/>\n<br/>\n3- Travel - In worlds where you don't have access to permanent Haste items, this domain is IMO a must. You get +4 Dodge AC and + 1 attack per round with Haste. It makes spellbook management a bit complicated, but the rewards are well worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\n4- Plant - With the Plant domain, you get access to Bakskin, which allows you to save the amulet slot for Wisdom-enhancing items in servers where that's the only slot you can use to enhance Wisdom. The build is supposed to be generic, and in Vanilla NWN, there are only Wisdom-enhancing Amulets, no rings, cloaks, etc, hence my choice to post this build with this domain. However, this becomes very droppable if your server has a variety of items that allow you to boost Wisdom in various slots.<br/>\n<br/>\n5- Animal: Animal also has Cat's Grace as a spell, although in an ideal world with no restrictions, I see no reason to pick this over War. However, on WoG there's a Pantheon system that severely restricts the domains one can pick for their characters, and one of the good God choices for this build is Ehlonna, which forces you to take Plant and Animal domains. So, I thought I'd list this just in case to help you circumvent any restrictions your server might have and pick domains that make sense for this build.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, this is where meta-knowledge of the server helps you select the best domains for your toon. I would suggest that, even though this guy is a POWERHOUSE, he shouldn't be your first build in the server, as you won't know how to optimize the domain picks, not knowing what's available to him. Start with something like my Champion of the Wilderness (a totally self-sufficient build that can go from 1-40 almost naked), learn the server, then make this guy and select the domains based on what items you know to be available.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is it for domains.

Then SD 5 for HiPS, monk 6 for IKD, and Cleric 15 to cap buffs, then you can round up the build and get ED at level 30. However, this build will be very vulnerable to dispels that way.

And I also know where to find these items, because I'm an old dog. You don't need to cap your stats this early. Eventually you will. You can cap DEX, WIS, STR and CON with a combination of items and buffs. But don't waste spell slots on Endurance. It's not necessary for a DEX-based Monk / Cleric.

For this build it isn't as relevant, but for others, it will make a HUGE DIFFERENCE. When you play a caster, especially a spellsword, there's often a lot of switching going on between items. For example, if you cast Owl's Wisdom on yourself, then unequip those boots, you won't lose any bonus you have, because the wisdom lost will remain there as a buff.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou should also memorize all your long-term buffs and some long-term summoning spells (i.e. Extended Create Greater Undead at level 9), on the last slots (the farthest ones to the right), and cast them before switching gear, especially if you plan to switch gear that will make you lose Wisdom as a result, which will cause you to lose spell slots as well. Once they're cast, you won't lose anything from swapping items. And these undeads can help you bait a few dispels off your enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said, for this build it's not so relevant, because WIS also adds to AC, and so you shouldn't be eager to lose any of your WIS, but for Myth's Blood &amp; Faith, for example, once that capped WIS has given you the extra spell slots, it doesn't do anything extra for you, so you can easily swap your items around for more combat-orientend ones.\u00a0</div>",

The only difference from a regular combat priest is the dex focus with ED and the monk &amp; SD cheese. An important difference from a regular dexer on the other hand is the available cleric buffs for AB, AC, weapon damage etc. that compensate well for the loss of SA damage.</div>",

This build as is can't without dropping epic feats.<br/>\n<br/>\n2- Go Cleric 26 Monk 1 Rogue 13 and drop the extra movespeed and HiPS, for Sneak Attack and UMD. It will have XP penalty, but won't need to get Dodge or Mobility, which are both SD requirements, then you can drop 1 BAB (you will have to take Monk 1 before 20 to get WF on Kamas, so no rule of 4 for you) and Called Shot to get the TWF feats. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn case what you meant here is if I would dual-wield WITHOUT the feats, no.

Whether Improved Critical is good or not, and whether it is better than having 2 more attacks, depends entirely on what you are going to fight. I haven't done any math, but in most cases I think I'd go with what Max did here.</div>"

This proposed tweak might work in high magic worlds, where another weapon would add more DPS, but it causes you to lose 2 AB points and 1 AC for what seems to be more damage at first glance. However, having more attacks per round that don't hit won't add ANY damage at all to your character, and may in fact REDUCE your damage output if it causes you to miss more. So, mostly, you'd do more damage against enemies that you can already hit anyway, while doing LESS damage to enemies with higher ACs. which in my experience are generally tougher. That's why I chose to forgo the TWF feats.</div>",

Taking the animal domain gives you a big advantage on early levels with your summon. Also, huge AC due to the monk wisdom + dex. Good AB due to many buffs + a lot of attacks due to flurry of blows. Cleric's Harm spell wipes out bosses. Truly a great build!</div>"
