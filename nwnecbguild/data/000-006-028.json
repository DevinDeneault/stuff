The closest was The Divine Howitzer: Paladin 10/ Wizard 1/ Arcane archer 29 by grizzled_dwarflord. It is very much the same kind of build, but mine is more extreme with higher charisma and saves at the cost of lower constitution and hitpoints. <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build295887.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 95887.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n The pros of this build is a high AB and a very high damage\u00a0including a\u00a0high and long lasting\u00a0divine damage capability. The saves are also very high.<br/>\n The character can be\u00a0dressed in a chain shirt, but benefits from full plate. Give him strength gear/buffs and a mighty bow for the extra damage and equip him\u00a0with charisma boosting gear and buffs\u00a0for max effect of the divine feats. Extra dexterity will add to the AB if you should need it. And you can cast True Strike in full armor since it only has a verbal component.<br/>\n<br/>\n The hitpoints are low, so this is not a frontline brawler. You have to be especially careful at level 1 with only 2 HPs!<br/>\n The AC is also low. There is no shield, Tumble is cross classed and the build does not have Armor skin. Divine shield is there for you when you need that extra defence.<br/>\n Think ahead and be smart, and you will survive and enoy this archer's potential.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><span style=\"color:#000000\">edit: per Hip 20161029 (additions of missing info, in</span></em><span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong> red</strong></span><em><span style=\"color:#000000\">)</span></em><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I like the saves boost, love the CHA focus, and believe it or not, I have just built one that was similar to yours, but with less focus on the AA class and more focus on Paladin goodies. I was going to post it here, now I'm not so sure it deserves a thread. Anyway, about your build:<br/>\n<br/>\n It worries me to see an Archer without Called Shot. This guy is terrible at avoiding melee and terrible at meleeing, so it would definitely be a priority to me to take Called Shot. Use CS: Leg thrice and nobody can reach you, which will increase this 6 CON elf's survivability by a ton. I'd drop Improved Critical or one Great Charisma for it easily and then rework the stats to get more skill points. Although it's not very holy, you could cross-class some trap skills to give yourself options when things do not favor ranged confrontation, but for that you'd need skill points. Start with STR 14 / DEX 17, WIS 8, CON 6 INT 14 and CHA 16, lower your saves by 1, damage by 1 with DM, and Dodge AC by 0 (if you have perma-haste you'll get Dodge from that, if not, you'll get Dodge from any boots) and 1 you'll have 1 less DM / DS per day, but you'll reduce your need for DS by A LOT! This way you have a still-very-proficient archer with a lot more tools to his arsenal and still very high saves and HUGE damage output like it was intended.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, you can make him a Paladin 8 Wizard 2 AA 30, since that Pally 9 level gives you nothing anyway and Wizard gives you one more True Strike a day :D<br/>\n<br/>\n Nice job!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It's a pain to have to drink a lore potion to be able to set a trap that you acquire without having to head back to the shop cuz it comes in unidentified. If you have access to a henchman, it's more playable, definitely, or just any type of meatshield, but only improved AI allows you to pull mobs 1 by 1. In fact, that's what traps would be for. They would help you deal with situations that are absolutely the worst for you to the point where you need no caution. Just a plain and simple trap field in a module (like the OCs) that doesn't use enhanced AI for their monsters and groups of monsters will instantly drop dead when you snipe one of them and they run towards your green carpet of death. That toon is great on 1-on-1's, but reworking the builds with my suggestions would still pretty much keep him as effective (1 damage will hardly make a difference) in those while giving him very effective tools to deal with mobs. A bit extreme? don't be so modest LOL! it's VERY extreme! But I do have to say that I am not really a fan of one-trick-ponies, which is why I made the following suggestions. I love maxed out RESOURCEFUL toons. Otherwise I'd make my Fighter 12 WM 25 Rogue 3 a Fighter 12 WM 28 for the extra AB point. My Holy Weapon Master with CHEESE would have only Great Strengths in epic levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n But each to their own, you have that Cleric 8 Rogue 2 Assassin 30 build that you loved, so this guy is definitely similar :D. And yeah, definitely I'd pick an illusionist, you know me.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

This version has a Paladin 8/ Wizard 2/ Arcane Archer 30 level split.I chose to give traps a priority over Called shot since the latter is more of a way to slow down a single creature, while traps can have effect on groups. and can supplement\u00a0 Imbue arrow, delayed blast fireball and other AOE spells from scrolls. Called shot can still be taken. Candidate feats to throw out are Rapid shot, Improved critical and Divine shield, pick your poison.<br/>\n A second wizard level at level 17 serves as a Spellcraft dump.<br/>\n I managed to free up 43 skillpoints for trap skills. and\u00a0cross-class 1 rank in disarm- and 5 ranks in set trap. I also put\u00a031 points in craft trap in epic levels, enough to craft deadly holy- or tangle\u00a0traps with 100% success and deadly electric traps with 85% success.
