      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hail, ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\n I was speaking to a new WoG player who had a really cool character concept. A Half-Orc Barbarian / Priest of Kord. But IMO he didn't implement it correctly, going for many Barb levels pre-epic. I really liked his idea, so I came up with my own version.\u00a0Clerics must strive to stay under 25 BAB (or rather AT 25 BAB) so that Divine Power can work its magic and give you an extra attack at full BAB. Having 4 attacks per round is BAD. If you have them, then your Divine Power (best spell in the game) becomes like a short-duration glorified Aid spell... After considering the essentials, I decided I wanted Terrifying Rage, which required 15 Barb levels and all Clerical buffs maxed out, so 15 levels of Cleric. The rest were free. Since Terrifying Rage goes hand to hand with ESF: Intimidate, and Barbarians can Taunt the hell out of their opponents, so I could take ESF: Taunt and put it to good use as well, I thought: if there was EVER a build where Harper Scout could be used to the maximum effectiveness, this is it!<br/>\n<br/>\n So, I came up with this guy:<br/>\n<br/>\n Cleric - brings all the buffs, spells and damage boosts to the table for a total of 64 fully-buffed AB.<br/>\n Barbarian - brings HP, Terrifying Rage and Taunt to the mix, and helps a lot with HP to counter-balance the 8 CON score.<br/>\n Harper Scout - Rounds up the build with ESF: Intimidate and Taunt, full Tumble AC, stacking Cat's Grace and Eagle's Splendor, and Craft Harper Item<br/>\n<br/>\n The result is a very scary priest with a high AB and damage, the ability to lower enemy AC by 6 (for a total of 70 AB) not counting debuffs from Prayer and Battletide. He's a beautiful offensive monster, with 5x per day Greater Rage that scares pretty much all non-immune monsters and for those immune he can hack and slash very effectively. Expertise and Taunt for the combo, but you won't need it most of the time. Only wish HS requirements weren't so heavy...<br/>\n<br/>\n Human would be better in this build because of Skill Points and the extra feat, not to mention not getting the INT penalty, which cost this guy some precious stat points that he could use for CON and more HP. I will make a Human version shortly and post it here as well. However, my toon will be a Half-Orc just for style points. It's part of the concept.<br/>\n<br/>\n There are 4 builds in the Search Engine with Cleric / Barbarian. Two go CoT, one goes Fighter and one goes Monk. The two CoTs get EDR, which I think is kinda pointless because your enemies will be running from you most of the time, or you'll just whack them so fast that they won't have time to do much damage to you. The Monk one involves an alignment change in the law-chaos axl, which ruined it for me since it's not feasible where I play. If it were in the Good / Evil, I'd be more inclined to like it\u00a0The Fighter one I guess would be the closest one, not going for EDR, but NONE manage to keep BAB at 25, which is one of the cornerstones of this guy. They also, strangely, ALL have Lower STR and therefore lower AB than this guy. And except for the Monk one, none have Tumble, so lower AC too. Their BAB may be higher, but whatever points they gain from that, I get back with Divine Power, which I will pretty much ALWAYS be buffed with after a certain while (moreso because of STR domain). Plus, neither of those has the coolness that comes with being a Harper.<br/>\n<br/>\n Ladies and Gents, I present you: The Terrifying Priest of Kord<br/>\n<br/>\n Cleric(19), Barbarian(16), Harper Scout(5), Half-Orc<br/>\n<br/>\n Alignment: Any non-lawful non-evil<br/>\n<br/>\n Playability: 1-40 PvM<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 18 (28)<br/>\n DEX: 8<br/>\n CON: 8<br/>\n WIS: 16 (19)<br/>\n INT: 14<br/>\n CHA: 6<br/>\n<br/>\n Half-Orc: (Darkvision)<br/>\n 01: Barbarian(1): Weapon Focus: Warhammer<br/>\n 02: Cleric(1): Domain Strength, Domain War<br/>\n 03: Cleric(2): Expertise<br/>\n 04: Cleric(3): WIS+1, (WIS=17)<br/>\n 05: Cleric(4)<br/>\n 06: Cleric(5): Extend Spell<br/>\n 07: Cleric(6)<br/>\n 08: Cleric(7): WIS+1, (WIS=18)<br/>\n 09: Cleric(8): Knockdown<br/>\n 10: Cleric(9)<br/>\n 11: Cleric(10)<br/>\n 12: Cleric(11): WIS+1, Blind Fight, (WIS=19)<br/>\n 13: Cleric(12)<br/>\n 14: Cleric(13)<br/>\n 15: Cleric(14): Alertness<br/>\n 16: Cleric(15): STR+1, (STR=19)<br/>\n 17: Cleric(16)<br/>\n 18: Cleric(17): Iron Will<br/>\n 19: Barbarian(2): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br/>\n 20: Barbarian(3): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n 21: Barbarian(4): Armor Skin<br/>\n 22: Harper Scout(1): Epic Skill Focus: Intimidate<br/>\n 23: Barbarian(5)<br/>\n 24: Barbarian(6): STR+1, Epic Weapon Focus: Warhammer, (STR=21)<br/>\n 25: Barbarian(7)<br/>\n 26: Barbarian(8)<br/>\n 27: Barbarian(9): Epic Prowess<br/>\n 28: Barbarian(10): STR+1, (STR=22)<br/>\n 29: Barbarian(11)<br/>\n 30: Barbarian(12): Great Strength I, (STR=23)<br/>\n 31: Barbarian(13)<br/>\n 32: Barbarian(14): STR+1, (STR=24)<br/>\n 33: Barbarian(15): Terrifying Rage<br/>\n 34: Harper Scout(2)<br/>\n 35: Harper Scout(3)<br/>\n 36: Harper Scout(4): STR+1, Great Strength II, (STR=26)<br/>\n 37: Harper Scout(5): Epic Skill Focus: Taunt<br/>\n 38: Cleric(18)<br/>\n 39: Cleric(19): Great Strength III, (STR=27)<br/>\n 40: Barbarian(16): STR+1, (STR=28)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 334<br/>\n Skillpoints: 220<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 22/27/15<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses: Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +6<br/>\n BAB: 25<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 38 (melee), 25 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 19/30<br/>\n Spell Casting: Cleric(9)<br/>\n Alignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\n Concentration 29(28), Discipline 43(52), Intimidate 43(51), Lore 6(13), Persuade 8(6), Search 4(6), Taunt 43(51), Tumble 40(39)<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Discipline(4), Intimidate(4), Lore(4), Search(2), Taunt(4), Save(4),<br/>\n 02: Lore(1), Persuade(5), Save(2),<br/>\n 03: Lore(1), Persuade(1), Search(1), Save(2),<br/>\n 04: Persuade(1), Save(5),<br/>\n 05: Persuade(1), Search(1), Save(6),<br/>\n 06: Save(10),<br/>\n 07: Save(14),<br/>\n 08: Save(18),<br/>\n 09: Save(22),<br/>\n 10: Save(26),<br/>\n 11: Save(30),<br/>\n 12: Save(34),<br/>\n 13: Save(38),<br/>\n 14: Save(42),<br/>\n 15: Save(46),<br/>\n 16: Save(50),<br/>\n 17: Save(54),<br/>\n 18: Save(58),<br/>\n 19: Discipline(18), Intimidate(14), Taunt(18), Save(14),<br/>\n 20: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(17),<br/>\n 21: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(20),<br/>\n 22: Discipline(1), Tumble(25),<br/>\n 23: Discipline(1), Intimidate(3), Taunt(2),<br/>\n 24: Discipline(1), Intimidate(4), Taunt(1),<br/>\n 25: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(3),<br/>\n 26: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(6),<br/>\n 27: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(9),<br/>\n 28: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(12),<br/>\n 29: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(15),<br/>\n 30: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(18),<br/>\n 31: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(21),<br/>\n 32: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(24),<br/>\n 33: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(27),<br/>\n 34: Discipline(1), Tumble(12), Save(20),<br/>\n 35: Discipline(1), Tumble(1), Save(24),<br/>\n 36: Discipline(1), Tumble(1), Save(28),<br/>\n 37: Discipline(1), Tumble(1), Save(32),<br/>\n 38: Concentration(28), Save(8),<br/>\n 39: Concentration(1), Save(11),<br/>\n 40: Discipline(3), Intimidate(7), Taunt(7),<br/>\n<br/>\n When I showed this guy to Valerfor,\u00a0he\u00a0suggested a tweak that I thought was an about even trade:<br/>\n<br/>\n You can alter the spread to Cleric 18 Barbarian 17 Harper Scout 5.<br/>\n<br/>\n You gain: 1 DR point from Barb 17, 4 HP and 2 Skill Points.<br/>\n You lose: 1 CL (and everything this implies with it: loss of one level 9 spell per day, slightly lower durations for all buffs, you\u00a0become 5% more\u00a0dispellable (you go from 20 to 25% dispellable by Greater Dispelling)).<br/>\n<br/>\n For me it's a matter of personal preference. I feel\u00a0that in my playstyle\u00a0I will need the extra durations and lower chance of dispellability more than 1 DR and the rest of the stuff, so I chose to maintain the spread as is. But I was also toying with Cleric 20 Barb 15 HS 5,\u00a0and ended up deciding on this one because\u00a0Barb 16 gives an extra use of Greater Rage, the possibility to get Terrifying Rage 6 levels earlier and the possibility to take Barbarian at level 40 to max out Discipline, Taunt and Intimidate, which was a worthwhile trade for just one CL. Just so you don't say I did this because I'm a Cleric fanatic lol!<br/>\n<br/>\n What do you think, guys?<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It feels a bit counter-productive at first glance, but this way he has options. He will not use his Rages and Taunt at the same time. He will also not have enough rages per day to be constantly scaring opponents. The Taunt option can help him fight in different ways so he can save up uses of Terrifying Rage for tougher battles without having to rest every 5 minutes. It also helps with monsters that are immune to fear, such as Undeads and Dragons.<br/>\n<br/>\n Of course, I am basing myself on my playing experience, so I would say that your point is quite valid for most if not all Single Player modules that have no rest restrictions for time or place. In those, I would probably max out Concentration instead and put the remaining points in Spellcraft for saves vs spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n On WoG, there are only a few areas per quest where the rest option is available and you can rest only once every 8 hours. In some quests, especially high level, you can go a LONG TIME without having a Rest area, so you need to be very stingy with your combat tools to make it from one place to the next. As an example, the Hall of the Fire Giant King (early 30s CR). You can rest outside, then you have a big map area where there are at least 2 (possibly 3 if you can find a secret door) boss battles, then you go underneath, there are 2 boss battles, one of which is a really TOUGH Drow battle cleric named Eclavdra (and LOADS of minions), then you go down again, you have to kill a Dragon and there is one more boss battle which has 3 named enemies (not so hard but if you face them\u00a0all together they can be tough) and again LOADS of tough minions, such as Drow Scouts (with Crippling Strike and Epic Dodge), Drow Warriors (high AB and high damage WMs), Drow Wizards (spellswords with Greater Ruin and Mummy Dust) and Drow Priestesses (high level battle clerics). The Drow Wizards cast Time Stop and Mord's on you. Only AFTER all these battles will you reach the next restable area (if you survive :) ). 5 Rages per day (4 at the time you should do that quest) are not nearly enough to last you through even one floor if you don't have other options.<br/>\n<br/>\n But, if anyone is going to use this build on a Single Player module, drop the entire Taunt skill and ESF: Taunt for Concentration (putting the remaining points in Spellcraft) and ESF: Discipline (or Concentration if you can find KD-immunity gear).<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks WhiZard!</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
