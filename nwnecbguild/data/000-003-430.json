      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">NEAT!! Implementing some of the changes re: Nemusator's RDD/AA (22 AA/8 Bard/10 RDD split) as per my recommendation? Beautiful split either way (really like the split, else I wouldn't have recommended it and don't expect me to be arguing/disagreeing with myself about it either! LOL   ). Also, going Dev.crit vs. his EER and high Con route. Yet another Drake archer then--oh, goody!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nAn AB 53 (51+2 Song) is really decent on an archer, and should be able to find a magic bow along the way (if can find one with the mighty property for the Drake STR to come in, there's some nice damage there to be had--lots of those over on the Pulse, old builds, only their creators went more STR than they did DEX, and nice to see the combo as such revisited). Would like to see a couple more points in DEX though, as discussed over on Nemusator's build here: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/norfilmar-rydo-smtin-bard6-rdd10-aa24-t2292285.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">norfilmar-rydo-smtin-bard6-rdd10-aa24-t2292285.html</a> . A shame about no called shot (an archer's best friend, it really is; hit on the legs slows enemies and is cumulative). An important feat, and might consider some stealth. Otherwise, nifty!!! (If it has drake wings, I admit that I tend to like.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThing is though, in adding all that gear as you did (+5 all items, +12 all STATS), in such a  place be mindful that everyone/everything else gets the exact same, and will be adjusted accordingly, including perma-haste (if there's bio-cap stats, there's perma-haste among a bunch of other things which everyone/everything else will also have). A Dev.Crit (DC) 39 isn't particularly great, not against melee (really good fort saves, especially in dev.crit game, which is their specialty) not to mention dev.crit immune things like undeads, etc.), but OK v i.e. mages (that tend to have low forts); however, if everything out there has +12 all stats,  ... er., .... (you know where I'm going with this, right?). Remember also that AC increases exponentially to AB, which in a high magic world (giving +12 all stats, DR, etc.) makes it quite hard for an archer, not to mention boost to all-saves gear that otherwise low fort things wouldn't otherwise get, eh? Meantime, with no uncanny dodge to protect your DEX-based AC, no discipline and low HPs, ... Just saying. <br/>\n<br/>\nTake Dex to 30 (at least), focus on hitting first, pull from STR (yes, DC will come down but as against melee, etc. doesn't matter either way, as won't be effective v them, not to mention the crit range on bow isn't that great either, keeping in mind also in a dev crit envions you're not the only one with dev.crit ...). Conversely, most rogues and mages tend not to have a good fort, but DEX'ers have a nice AC by contrast (with rogues enjoying stealth), and mages buffed up the wazzoo. (One well placed arrow from a distance, heh. But if everyone has +12 to all stats, er .. ). Let's keep it low-mid magic, eh?  <br/>\n<br/>\nQuite a number of these on the Pulse/Search engine, only they don't focus so much on DEX as they do STR. Happy to see more DEX (AB), though you'll want to take a look at them for feat-arrangement (among other things, PBS can't wait). When you're an archer, DEX is definitely the way to go (so go a bit more of it, as AB = hit, and important for all but especially archers). Always thought the RDD/AA dev.crit angle to be a neat one, and looks like a lot of fun PvM/E. With a nice bow having mighty property, heh, thar be some nice damage which really helps an archer out. Yep, I like these guys. Always did, and still do. <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: pointing out differences, remove typo, and point out some feat-selection and arrangement stuff.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

However, picking up a melee weapon focus along with Disc. is a very good idea, along with more HPs as well (archers from the distance can get away with less HPs; one without called shot will need to melee quite a lot and, if going to do some melee needs some melee AB along with more HPs and some discipline (and then there's the issue re: uncanny--no, you do not want to be knocked, disc. is good!!!) Otherwise, more DEX for AB/AC and called shot (and keep enemy at bay), with a side-arm weapon just in case (along with some discipline). Depends on which way he wants to go, there being some options here (nice thing about dem drakes, and with those wings they always look good doing it.  ).<br/>\n<br/>\nMeantime, there's never any such thing as too much AB. And when I see +12 all stats, etc., I tend to think \"high magic\" PWs where not only are all the monsters enjoying uber high ACs, they also have immunities and resistances up the ying yang (DR/soak, damage immunities, etc.) in which case, only thing an archer's got, and even then it's not enough ... <br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise, yeah, a practical archer with the mighty bow--RDD STR really helps (and with a melee presence that would be cool, especially if want to solo, which sounds good).<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

This where most AA builds miss the boat, to begrudgingly yielding a few AB to gain more damage potential in a build where AB has become overkill anyway.  And except for the loss of some reflex vs. spells, AC should never become an issue with a properly-played archer *Is this Deja Vu all over again? Where have I read this before?*\n<blockquote><div><strong>Maximillian Kane wrote:</strong>If your intent is to devcrit, why not take Rapid Reload and Heavy Crossbow? The threat range is better so more Devcrits...</div></blockquote>Only a possibility if you feel you can waste a pre-epic feat on a focus you won't use (per AA prereqs).  Rapid Shot will compensate for some of the added threat range, but it is still worth considering.  Thing is, if the build is already starved enough to omit Called Shots, why not use that \"wasted\" slot that would go to bow focus for that feat.  It's Catch-22.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, do ranged DevCrits trigger outside the 30 ft radius?  Just curious.  Anybody test this?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">And yet I see you brought your AB up ... much  better <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it comes to an archer, folks, AB is EVERYTHING. Hardly over-rated, at all. Whole point is to hit and NOT GET HIT. AC doesn't much matter (that is the main thing for casters, among other things; meantime, as Dex build, with tumble and RDD AC, AC is already nice, although not protected by Uncanny so not the reason for raising DEX here; rather, for reflex and AB. which I say again is important). Indeed, when it comes to AB--things that <strong>need</strong> to hit things to actually do damage such as melee and archers alike, it bears repeating: when you hit, you damage and don't get damaged in turn, provided you have damage to deliver when you do hit that is. The ab as it was was OK low to mid-magic PvM/E as said; however, when I see +12 all stats, that's not low-mid magic by far. In a high magic world by contrast, where AC increases exponentially to AB and where things also have DR and damage/elemental/etc. immunities up the wazoo, hitting isn't enough. In such places, the classic high AA AB isn't enough. I mean, archers are not like a high STR/high AB warrior with crit.crazy factor, a caster that slings spells of all types, or a rogue that sets traps of all types either. I well realise that this is a PvM/E build, and for low-mid magic, the ab as is is fine, and now it's even better. Classic. But you'll still want called shot in there, though, otherwise, gotta worry about HPs (which are still a bit low when it comes to melee), lack of discipline (which is important also throughout your career, as takes some time to blossom) and a side arm (WF) so as to be able to melee in turn and especially without uncanny). <br/>\n<br/>\nTo put things in perspective, a crit.crazy WM does more damage on account of the crits than archer has HPs ... many other things do as well, and where dev.crit is permitted things (not just melee PCs but monsters) tend to have good fort saves so as to resist a dev.crit, meantime, they themselves can dev.crit, too. Perspective, folks. And this in turn is why it is that archers do not tend to do well in high magic worlds. Simply do not punch enough damage, despite the classic high AA AB, though the mighty bow with a nice RDD strength to operate same does help, assuming can get a nice mighty bow which in high magic shouldn't be a problem, with UMD being nice so as to help out in that department, too (very nice). But then, all those other things like DR, elemental immunities, etc. come into play; so, back to low-to-mid magic, then, as most worlds things do tend to be balanced, yes?  And in a low-to-mid magic world, this AB is super! Really is. And RDD is sweet as well. That said discipline here (epsecially without called shot) is important, and will be an issue as lots of things KD, and they do so quite a lot, and that's not just melee monster types either as there's also the Balg.Horn. You will want to train up some displine, accordingly. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of feat arrangements, you'll want to take PBS right away, and want to take some Weapon Finesse as you don't have called shot (meaning, monsters and swarms especially will get to you, especially without called shot, and you'll need to swap out to a side arm/finesse weapon instead, with RDD str helping out there in terms of the damage as well, but for which you'll want some more HPs and discipline). <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this is where it gets so difficult, on account of the feats required to meet dev.crit requirments. Instead of RS, I'd be inclined to grab Called Shot instead. Yes, RS is super, however, CS is incredibly important to an archer, in the beginning of your career, in the middle, in the end and all throughout regardless of magic level either. And this is especially true of one that intends on focussing mainly and primarily as an archer as that feat (and that feat alone) means that your enemies will move really really slow as each time you hit (and you will, not with this classic AA AB worried about that!) it's accumulative, so that they won't get to you so as to KD, damage, etc. you in turn. And with this safety zone, you then damage and/or force the fort save v insta death from a safe shooting distance all you want, being able to move around at your Bard Haste speed (Bard gives YOU haste, thus an extra hit per round at full AB), and which is the whole point of a dev.crit archer, yes? <br/>\n<br/>\nWithout it, you will want to have a side-arm ready, more HPs and definitely train discipline. Still, and either way, nice to have a side arm ready in any event, and not to be taken lightly, especially not if you like to do any soloing that is. RDD str helps not just in terms of the dev.crit requirements, but also when it comes to some melee and that's nothing to sneeze at either, and especially not if you like to solo as said. A beautiful thing, yes?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
