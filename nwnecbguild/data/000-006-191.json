Only the Robust Reanimator is designed as a true support character, taking constitution and Epic DR at the expense of wisdom and spell focus.<br/>\n<br/>\n Support characters are nothing new, and neither is Cleric PM. However, all of the above builds aim for high AC, and that is what makes this build unique.<br/>\n<br/>\n It is a Cleric Wizard Palemaster support character designed to operate in a robe, with next to no AC at all.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n On the surface this sounds like lunacy, particularly when you consider that without discipline, it becomes prime Knockdown bait. However, it does provide advantages that may not be obvious at first.<br/>\n<br/>\n For starters, it frees up quite a few feats and skills, allowing for some interesting additions to the support cleric line-up, such as Automatic Silent Spell and trapping ability [+13 to skills from Trickery Domain works wonders here].<br/>\n<br/>\n It allows for arcane spellcasting without penalty, which for this character is equivalent to a level 11 wizard [level 6 spells].<br/>\n<br/>\n Most interestingly, it can turn the character into a target and bait the opposition into combat, which in many circumstances is exactly what the party wants. Drawing the opposition\u2019s attention draws it away from other party members, allowing them to operate freely and attack key enemy targets without hindrance. Critical Hit Immunity, Epic DR III, High HP, 50% concealment from Improved Invisiblity or Displacement, healing spells, very high concentration and the ability to cast several lesser spell mantles, make this character a tough nut to crack.<br/>\n<br/>\n If it does come under threat from melee, it can, given a small time window, cast 5 different types of damage shields [albeit small ones], that last for at least 12 rounds. These, combined with a plethora of healing spells and items, should be sufficient to kill, if not at least deter, melee characters from attacking it.<br/>\n<br/>\n It also can [in a vanilla nwn environment] simply cast <strong>Greater Sanctuary</strong>, rendering it <strong>impossible to target</strong> by archery, melee and target spells such as Flame Arrow. A bug exists that it won\u2019t work if the character has Improved Invisibility, so advise removing this with Invis Purge first or not casting it at all before using Greater Sanctuary. While active, this spell should not break when casting heal spells on allies, and can only be broken via a hostile action from the caster, or an opponent mage firing a Mordenkainen's Disjunction at the ground.<br/>\n<br/>\n In short: It is a character that requires coordination and organisation on the part of its opponents to deal with effectively. At the same time, it is very good at disrupting an organised opponent.<br/>\n<br/>\n I first encountered this type of character on the Antiworld Capture the Flag Server; a team pvp server with several modifications to spells and classes [for e.g. Greater Sanctuary and Damage Shields were nerfed, Palemaster gave less AC, etc.] and some imposed rules about ability use [mainly to prevent spam of things like Death Magic or Knockdown]. It has since shut down, resurrected on the odd occasion for a few days.<br/>\n<br/>\n There were a few cleric PM \u2018healer\u2019 characters on that server [a lot taking the AC bard pm route], but this one was my favourite variant. It was one of the most annoying little bastards you could encounter on that battlefield, and universally hated or loved depending on what team it was playing on.<br/>\n<br/>\n Whilst this character was designed for a particular brand of team pvp, it is still very useful for a PvM party. It has a myriad of options for supporting its party, particularly against spellcasting combatants.<br/>\n<br/>\n If it is absolutely required it can, due to its clerical nature, don heavy armour and shield, summon forth allies, pick up a mace or darts and buff to the brink to achieve reasonable AB/AC/Damage. But that is not in this character\u2019s nature.<br/>\n<br/>\n The well learned medical doctor does not condone violence. As the adage goes: First Do No Harm.<br/>\n<br/>\n At least, not directly. <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/6.gif\"/>\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Advantages</strong><br/>\n -Level 9 Cleric Spells, with a specific focus on buffing and Healing party members.<br/>\n -Level 6 Wizard Spells, thanks to the extra PM levels, with a focus on buffing party members and providing anti-mage countermeasures. Given it only has 6 wizard levels, it\u2019s best to learn as many scrolls as it can manage.<br/>\n -Super high concentration, with the only threat to disruptions coming from Knockdown [assuming no immunity items are available], Counterspelling, modified monsters with super high Strength, and High DC Empowered/Maximised Chain Lightning.<br/>\n -Lots of metamagic options: Silent Spell allows for just about any spell to be cast a level above if required. Automatic Silent Spell III allows for every spell to be cast under the cover of the cleric spell Silence, which is a massive advantage to have if battling spellcasting opponents.<br/>\n -Craft Wand and Scribe Scroll, for a large backup supply of both divine and arcane spells if required.<br/>\n -Proficient in Opening Locks and Detecting, Recovering and Setting Up Deadly Traps with Trickery Domain Active [handy little guide there Hip!]. For Epic Traps, there\u2019s the Find Traps Spell.<br/>\n -Extremely hardy. 10 Palemaster Levels + Epic DR III + Epic Fire Resistance make for a tough little character.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Disadvantages:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n -Low AC. Given its low strength and arcane casting ability, it is advised to wear Wizards Robes.<br/>\n -No Discipline. This combined with its low AC is its most glaring weakness. If focused and isolated by a determined pack of melee opponents, they can bring this character down relatively quickly. The challenge for this character, then, is to not allow that to happen by hiding behind their allies, using non-healing spells only when necessary and engaging when they feel that it is safe to do so. Strength-Based Monks were its arch nemesis.<br/>\n -Very low strength, which is a problem for carrying lots of items or wearing armour. It may be worth sacrificing the 4 points in Dex for Strength [to carry more stuff].<br/>\n -Buffs are vulnerable to Mordenkainen\u2019s Disjunction [excluding Weapon Buffs and Magic Vestment].<br/>\n -Fairly low Reflex Save. High DC Evocation Spells, such as Chain Lightning, can present a problem for the character.<br/>\n -Easy to play, tricky to master. Has a lot of options up its sleeve, but only so many spellslots. Preparation is key!<br/>\n<br/>\n Without further ado:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;line-height:normal\"><strong><span style=\"color:#4C5D77\">Cleric(24), Wizard(6), Pale Master(10), Gnome</span></strong></span><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Alignment: </strong>Any non-good for Pale Master [True Neutral Recommended].<br/>\n<strong>\u00a0<br/>\nAbilities</strong><br/>\n \u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n STR: 6<br/>\n DEX: 12<br/>\n CON: 16 (22)<br/>\n WIS: 16 (20)<br/>\n INT: 16<br/>\n CHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Basic Stats:</strong><strong>\u00a0</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 574<br/>\n Skillpoints: 215<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 28/27/21<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9, Mind Effects: +2<br/>\n BAB: 25, 3 attacks per round.<br/>\n<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 24 (melee), 27 (ranged).<br/>\n Mundane Melee: +24/+19/+14.<br/>\n Mundane Ranged: +27/+22/+17.<br/>\n Maxed Abilities and Cleric Buffs: +26 to above.<br/>\n<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 22/32<br/>\n Spell Casting: Cleric(9),Wizard(6)<br/>\n \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cleric Domains: </strong><br/>\n First, Trickery for Invisibility Sphere, Improved Invisibility and the Domain Power [+13 to rogue skills at 24th level cleric].<br/>\n<br/>\n Depending on what is most appropriate: Travel or Healing for the 2nd domain. Travel provides early Entangle, Web, Freedom as a level 3 spell, and Haste as a level 5 spell. This would probably suit best for Single Player or PW\u2019s, as Heal Kits should be enough to cover for minor out-of-combat healing jobs, and Hasted Summons and Allies are always nice.<br/>\n<br/>\n Healing empowers all Cure Spells, and grants Cure Serious Wounds at level 2 and Heal at level 5. I personally chose Healing whilst I was playing on Antiworld as everyone automatically got given Haste, and summons were next to worthless.<br/>\n<br/>\n War or Plant also makes good candidates for the 2nd domain.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Specialised Spell School:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n Necromancy. This is to gain the extra spell slot, whilst sacrificing as little spells as possible. Necromancy prohibits Divination, which includes spells such as True Strike [not relevant], Identify [can be compensated for with Lore if necessary] and True Seeing [which is covered by Cleric].<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Familiar: </strong><br/>\n<br/>\n Faerie Dragon, for the Free Improved Invisibility spell and Confuse Bolt.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Feats:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n

20(21).</span><br/>\n<br/>\n Concentration and Spellcraft are imperative to the build. Tumble is taken cross class to prevent attacks of opportunity mainly, but it does provide a small boost to AC in the event the character decides to pack on AC.<br/>\n<br/>\n The remaining 80 or so skill points can be spent on several things depending on what is most appropriate to the module. For this version, I decided to include minimal stealth and trapping skills after reading Hip\u2019s guide. Again, if discipline seems like a worthy prospect due to an abundance of skill boosting items but no KD immune gear, keep in mind that you\u2019ll need to take Epic Skill Focus Discipline at level 39 [need 20 ranks for ESF], which means juggling around some other feats.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>SPELLS</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n Here are a list of spells to keep in mind. I\u2019ve written a little categorisation guide of useful spells out, to hopefully help people wrap their head around what is useful. Thanks to the duel spellbooks there are a lot on offer, so it is very useful to have an appropriate spellbook set out for the situation. Preparation and prior knowledge help in this regard.<br/>\n<br/>\n Extend Spell allows for double length buffs [at 1 Level Higher], Empower allows for 50% versions of ability buffing [e.g. Bull\u2019s Strength] and Cure Spells [at 2 Levels higher], and Silent Spell allows for just any spell to be slotted 1 level higher [for e.g. Silent Mass Heal at level 9]. With the healing domain, all normal cure spells are automatically empowered.<br/>\n<br/>\n Remember that wands can be crafted of the level 1-4 spells, and scrolls can be scribed for all of them. Scrolls and Wands are cast at a fixed level [and not always their base level, it is worth investigating this!].<br/>\n<br/>\n Cleric Spells are caster level 24, Wizard Spells are caster level 6.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Attack and Damage Buffs.</strong> I recommend giving most of these to all your party members.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cleric:</strong> Bless [1], Magic Weapon [1], Aid [2], Ability Buffs e.g. Bull\u2019s Strength [2], Prayer [3], Darkfire [3], Greater Magic Weapon [4].<br/>\n<strong>Wizard:</strong> Keen Edge [3].\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>AC, HP and Saves Buffs: </strong>Again, I recommend giving most of these to your party members.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cleric:</strong> Resistance [0], Shield of Faith [1], Ability Buffs e.g. Endurance [2], Magic Vestment [3], Undeath\u2019s Eternal Foe [9].<br/>\n<strong>Wizard:</strong> Mage Armour [1], Shadow Conjuration Mage Armour [4].\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Auxiliary Buffs.</strong> Context defines usefulness here. For e.g. if you\u2019re not fighting any elemental damage, don\u2019t bother with element resist spells. Key from this list are Mind Protection [PFA/Clarity], Death Ward, Freedom, UV/TS and Improved Invisibility.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cleric:</strong><br/>\n Level 1: Endure Elements, Entropic Shield, Protection from Alignment.<br/>\n Level 2: Invisibility, Resist Elements, Silence, Ultravision.<br/>\n Level 3: Clarity, Invisibility Sphere, Negative Energy Protection, Protection from Elements.

All these spells are subject to spell resistance and so are not recommended against monks. Breach spells may help before applying these.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>With Saves [Cleric Only, primarily at early levels]:</strong> Entangle [1] and Web [2] if Travel Domain is taken, and then Hold Person [2], Sound Burst [2] and Hammer of the Gods [4].<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Without Saves, Cleric:</strong> Silence if cast on an ally [2], Darkness [2], Invisibility Sphere [3, special].<br/>\n<strong>Without Saves, Wizard:</strong> Balagorn\u2019s Iron Horn [2], Bigby\u2019s Interposing Hand [5], Bigby\u2019s Forceful Hand [6].<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Summons [if necessary, Cleric Only]:</strong><br/>\n Summon Creature [1-9], Animate Dead [3], Create Greater Undead [8].

I wouldn't even waste my time trying to Mord the silence effect because it won't be a problem for any high Wiz that owns enough metamagic and knows how to cast spells. First, strip the lame mantles provided by the low caster level of scrolls (or those lesser versions) using Flame Arrow and then finish off with one of the above.<br/>\n<br/>\n Of course, it's still a cleric so can self-buff a decent AB with divine damage, but that assumes it would get within melee range (which it won't) and survive 3 damage shields to use the weapon. Piercing Epic Warding will also be a challenge, assuming it gets that close. That's a whole lot of \"if's\" IMO. Maybe against a noob mage it might work. Clc 24 is not all that much a serious offensive casting threat without high penetration (more levels, pen feats) and focus of choice (+ much higher WIS), either. For your wizard spells, the problem is that only durations are impacted by PM so that means all spells are cast as a level 6 wizard regardless of the spell level (and that includes spells like NEB that would max out at 7-14 wither and -1 STR drain).<br/>\n<br/>\n Looks like basically a punching bag with skeletal hand to me so if that's the main purpose, I suppose there would be a use for it as a party tank. It WILL be getting hit in melee, though. A lot. Better hope no Divine Might types decide to pound away with a greataxe or other high-damage STR weapon and bypass all your intrinsic DR. A divine AA will easily shred any DR buffs and get to your 9 point reduction post haste. Those 600 HP will drop quickly and you'll be healing yourself instead of your comrades.<br/>\n<br/>\n Have you checked Mith's Wiz12/DwD18/PM10? Interesting reading for prospective arcane tankers. Uses damage shields instead of melee to exact damage while healing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>edit (added after the reworked topic):<br/>\n<br/>\n Since first examining this concept, I've thrown together a quick facsimile and did some PvM testing.\u00a0 For PvM, it does rather well.\u00a0 But I changed the build to:<br/>\n (also tested the dwarven version because the trainer is not biased about leveling... hehehe )<br/>\n<br/>\n Clc 15/Wiz 15/ PM10, Any non-good (probably TN) Gnome (Dwarf a bit more STR/saves but XP pen likely to meet autometa prereqs)<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 6 --&gt; 8 if dwarf<br/>\n DEX: 8<br/>\n CON: 18 (24)<br/>\n WIS: 16 (18)<br/>\n INT: 16 (20)<br/>\n CHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n Feats: Silent/Extend/Empower, CC/ICC, Blind Fight, Expertise, Craft Wand, Toughness, EDR3, Autosilent 3, Grt INT x2<br/>\n<br/>\n HP max: 578<br/>\n Saves F/W/R (v spells): 29/29/14 (38/38/23 +1 w/emp fox)<br/>\n BAB: 22 (3 APR)<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 21 (melee), 22 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 20/30<br/>\n<br/>\n Concentration 43(52), Spellcraft 43(48, 50 w/emp Fox), Tumble 20(19), funpoints ---&gt; 102<br/>\n<br/>\n Your premise relies on casters trying to dispel the silence effect by their spellbook version which is impossible since all dispels and breaches contain a verbal component.\u00a0 That works fine for PvM because AFAIK there is no creature AI that tries to switch to wand/scroll dispelling and their default metamagic are limited to either extended, empowered or maximized versions.\u00a0 Actually, it works like a charm because they are still \"dumb\" as compared to PvP opponents.\u00a0 There are ways to build a creature AI that can identify the Silence buff and make on-the-fly changes to counter it, but I haven't experienced one that advanced... not yet anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n Apparently, by reading your strategy notes, you haven't tested this method against a viable PvP team.\u00a0 The strats are easily countered by any players that have experience with Silence clerics, a very old strategy, BTW, dating back into PnP team competition.\u00a0 No caster factions would be foolish enough to enter combat vs. silencers without silent metamagic at their disposal.\u00a0 It would be pretty silly not to, no?\u00a0 Your main shield damage is too pedestrian to cause much trouble for the melee PvP faction once their mage(s) breach them with their silent versions or using scrolls and have pre-buffed their comrades with elemental protection.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, with all this said, I believe the 15/15/10 split is far superior in PvM for several reasons.\u00a0 First, as already stated, the Silence effect prevents dispelling and breaching (except when it is a monster special ability which has no verbal component), so caster levels are no longer necessary to prevent dispel check failure and secondly, the Level 9 wiz Mords, Time Stops, Shapechange and BBoD are game changers... much more so than Implosion or SoV.\u00a0 The spell penetration is still not optimized but at least it is balanced for arcane and divine casting and arcane durations gain the 10 PM levels. Your buffed Tenser and Iron Golem will be far superior melee/damage sinks for all but high-magic weapon/gear enhancements. In addition, it is a huge bonus to be able to scribe all arcane spells, especially for the bards and UMD users of the party.<br/>\n<br/>\n So think about what I've illuminated.\u00a0 Your's is not a bad idea, just not near as effective in team PvP as what you've described.\u00a0 Perhaps you should try HG or similar advanced environments to engage some spellcaster PvP with experienced players?\u00a0 Funky has designed outstanding creature AIs for that environment (there are multiple HG servers to chose from) and balanced for high-challenges.\u00a0 And yes, there are all kinds of PvP going on there, mainly by appointment in regulated areas. They tend to abandon RP in those designated areas and concentrate on combat engagements.<br/>\n<br/>\n BTW, I had previously glossed over the stats of Aura vs. Alignment and never realized there were some damage elements involved (figured it was just an AoE version of PvA), which proves that regardless of one's experience level, there are always tidbits to glean from member contributions.\u00a0 I tend to use the other Level 8 spells more (especially Mass Heal in the crypts), but it does open up options.</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

Should force be to think a bit and not resort to boring cheap tactics.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now then: Onto the reply!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#000000\">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span><br/>\n<br/>\n First off: I think you seem to misunderstand what the point of the character is. It\u2019s not meant to be some glorified damage shield tank, or a well honed Silence abusing countermage. It\u2019s meant to be a <strong>healer</strong>, that keeps its party alive, with as many heals as possible, and has some additional defense measures to stop it from dying.\u00a0In comparison to similar characters [like the Robust Reanimator], it also lacks AC which yes, means that if it is unguarded or vulnerable or that it is going to get hit a lot. The damage shields and Silence/Spell Mantles are secondary.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n PvP is a funny thing. It is very dependent on the items that are available, what tactics are allowed from the beginning, and any particular server side modifications that happen to be in place. I\u2019m not about to claim to be an expert at it, but I feel that I\u2019ve witnessed and participated in enough of it to at least have a moderately informed opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n In most PvP environments, mages by default are the silliest as they have a lot of unbalanced spells and abilities. The first PW I played on had a factional pvp arrangement, relatively high magic items [standard was +7 but could be boosted to +12 using rare loot items], but no magic or spell immunity items nor spell modifications. Kings of PvP in that realm were mainly mages, including half caster cleric/sorcerer types with harm, IGMS and dev crit, and epic dodge mages whose sole tactic was to stand still, time stop and IGMS spam-cannon everything.<br/>\n<br/>\n Fast forward to another PW that I've played on that encouraged pvp, and there was an Evocation Immunity helmet and a Necromancy Immunity cloak. Combine that with an elemental resistance ring and the only threat a mage could impose on a well geared opponent was Petrfication or Damage Shields.<br/>\n<br/>\n Antiworld was a very interesting PvP environment in that a lot of modifications were done to level the playing field in a PvP context, and make every type of class worth its salt. A little bit of this involved increasing the abilities of Assassins and Blackguard, but most of it involved nerfing PM's, clerics and mages. It also had some imposed rules.<br/>\n<br/>\n Off the top of my head:\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n -Nature\u2019s Balance was an Caster-Area Mordenkainen\u2019s Disjunction, making druids a somewhat viable PvP spellcaster,<br/>\n<br/>\n -Cleric/Paladin buffs were reduced [GMW and Div Favour to +3 instead of +5],<br/>\n<br/>\n -Dev Crit was Banned,<br/>\n<br/>\n -PM got an AC increase of 1 every 4 levels, not 2,<br/>\n<br/>\n -Epic Warding was reduced to 30/+15 DR [and at another time just 50% damage immunity to physical] instead of 50/+20,<br/>\n<br/>\n -Time Stop didn\u2019t work,<br/>\n<br/>\n -Greater Sanctuary had a will save,<br/>\n<br/>\n -Acid Sheath only dealt a max of 1d6 + 1 caster level in damage, and if applied Elemental Shield, both their damages were halved,<br/>\n<br/>\n -Bigby\u2019s Forceful Hand had a Reflex save,<br/>\n<br/>\n -Igms did significantly less damage [only max of 10 missiles not 20], making the main mage weapons Maxed Ice Storm and Flame Arrow,<br/>\n<br/>\n -Harm did significantly less damage,<br/>\n<br/>\n -Heal/greater Restore/Mass Heal only healed 100hp on yourself, and 200hp if it was cast on somebody else.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n In addition: Heal Kits could not be spammed in combat, hold or death spells and feats could only be used ONCE EVERY 18 SECONDS on an opponent to prevent someone spamming them all day, and ranged combatants were FORCED TO STAND STILL FOR THE DURATION OF A ROUND to prevent archers from kiting everyone or mages from taking flame arrow pot shots and running away.<br/>\n<br/>\n Even in this modified environment and with the imposed rules, the kings of the battlefield were still: AC based sorcerers, with dippings in paladin, blackguard and/or monk. Sorc/Pal Spellswords did very well too. People were also organised into 'Good' and 'Evil' teams, so there were occasionally smiters. But everyone hated those. :P<br/>\n<br/>\n Wizards were definitely around, but lacking the versatility to cast spells on the fly and the spell slot ammunition available to sorcerers, they mainly focused on High DC spellcasting to make best use of their feats.<br/>\n<br/>\n Unfocused multiclassed wizards, like that Wizard DD PM you suggested, would not have had the firepower to deal with anybody. The normal mage cheesecake weapons of Bigby\u2019s Forceful Hand, IGMS spam, Damage Shields and GS/BBoD would\u2019ve helped it, and it certainly wouldn\u2019t be dying in a hurry, but it wouldn\u2019t have been able to kill anyone either. \u00a0High level opposition would simply laugh in its face, then leave it in the dust to go start capturing the flag repeatedly and getting xp for their team.<br/>\n<br/>\n People did make troll characters such as PM DD\u2019s that were nigh indestructible and designed purely just to capture the flag, and I suppose it would\u2019ve at least been good for that. But in the event that it got targeted by a bunch of enemies, again: IGMS did less damage, GS had a will save attached so just about everyone would\u2019ve seen through it without spell focus, Damage shields were based a lot more on caster level [and 12 is basically no caster levels], and Epic Warding was not the ridiculous spell it normally was. Occasionally someone would make a constitution based PM mage on that server, and either people would leave it alone to make lots of noise in the corner, or log a Rak/Divine Damage character and blast it to death.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway! I am going to assume that you\u2019ve never played on the niche team pvp land that was Antiworld, and that the PvP context you\u2019re talking about is more in line with the land of the Epic Dodge Sorcerers or PM Wizards that timestop and spam cannon everything with Epic Warding up, or use GS and get a +27 AB invincible sword to bore everyone to death. Good old balanced nwn.<br/>\n<br/>\n So how does this skeletal bag hold up in a 1v1 scenario? Not very well, as it is not designed as a 1v1 character, as evidenced by the introduction. But given it gets caught in a 1v1 scenario, how does it fair?<br/>\n<br/>\n Against a Wizard who\u2019s had the foresight to prepare an entire spellbook of metamagic\u2019d silent offensive spells? Not very well. It\u2019ll run out of mantles in less than a minute, then succumb to a Forceful Hand like any other low strength character that lacks a KD immunity item and be IGMS\u2019d to death. Either that, or the mage will use timestop at the beginning and completely skip the mantle dance.<br/>\n<br/>\n Against a Divine Archer that does lots of damage, running around kiting to avoid being hit? Not very well. Though if the divine archer was unprepared, the character could theoretically shoot an afore mentioned Forceful Hand at it.<br/>\n<br/>\n Against a pack of melee opponents who charge up to it and start KD spamming it? Probably the worst of all. It\u2019s not designed to deal with being bullrushed, and in its designed setting the most effective way to deal with was to log a pack of high damage monks, smother it, then bugger off before any of them died.<br/>\n<br/>\n But we\u2019re not in its designed setting anyway, so you\u2019re forgetting one silly spell that could ameliorate the majority of its woes: GREATER SANCTUARY! Which it can cast about 14 of with wisdom gear: more than a typical mage would have Mordenkainens Disjunction.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#000000\">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n So with that in mind, let\u2019s go back to the wizard, put everyone in a PARTY context, and give it enough an ample supply of Greater Sanctuaries. I\u2019m going to assume the Wizard is also a PM, so that it doesn\u2019t have the chance of getting critted into oblivion by a Two-Handed WM even with Epic Warding up. If not, well, it\u2019s pretty obvious what teammate I\u2019m gonna pick. :P<br/>\n<br/>\n First off, if you\u2019re gonna allow timestop into any engagement from the beginning then sure, go ahead. IMO that the sign you\u2019ve given up trying to fight fairly, and I\u2019m just gonna shake your hand and not bother trying to fight you again. There is basically no counter to timestop other than timestop [though I suppose a well timed forceful hand at someone using timestop could be a counter]. It\u2019s a silly spell, and from the beginning it should be agreed not to be used.<br/>\n<br/>\n If you\u2019re not gonna use that stupid game breaking spell: Presumably the Wizard now has a spellbook with an ample supply of Silenced Bigby\u2019s and IGMS. Good for it. It\u2019s sacrificed Empowered and Maximised Damage spells, and lacks the firepower to engage for a long period of time. Already the healer has at least gotten under its skin.<br/>\n<br/>\n So the fight begins and the healer chucks a mantle on, waits to be hit with the obligatory Mords, then Greater Sancs straight after. The Wizard won\u2019t be able to TARGET IT WITH ANYTHING that isn\u2019t an Area Spell, and be forced to shoot another Mordenkainen\u2019s at the ground to dispel Greater Sanctuary. This, is a level 9 spell, can be dodged from a distance, and cannot be silenced. If it was forced engage in a spellcaster war with the healer long enough for another party member with a silence aura to get within range, it will not be able to fire off that Mordenkainen. Which will leave it the choice of Greater Sanctuary\u2019ing itself and run away to be chased by everyone [and be separated from its own party], or to stand there for a brief second with Damage Shields/Warding up before they too were breached and, it too, became a skeletal punching bag.<br/>\n<br/>\n Divine archers are set up 30m away and begin running hellfire on it from afar? Greater Sanctuary, no more hellfire. Healer is free to run around being an annoying medic, as HEALING SPELLS DO NOT BREAK GREATER SANCTUARY. Apply same tactic to charging melee characters.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#000000\">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span><br/>\n<br/>\n If you agree that Greater Sanctuary should be banned from the off after what you\u2019ve read, then fair enough. But it\u2019s still going to have significantly reduced the Wizard\u2019s offensive capability due to it having to rewrite its spell book, and can still Breach/Forceful Hand an archer.<br/>\n<br/>\n It has performed its job, which from the beginning as stated is: To be a healer character, with some anti-mage measures, that requires coordination on the part of the opposing team to bring down, whilst having the capacity to disrupt coordination.<br/>\n<br/>\n If it is absolutely necessary, then it can cast a few offensive spells, or slap on some damage shields. And if you were to make this a Single Player Character with some offensive capability then yes, going 15 wizard over cleric would make it a stronger character.<br/>\n<br/>\n But that\u2019s not what it is designed to do. The title is: First Do No Harm.<br/>\n<br/>\n It\u2019s a doctor. That\u2019s what its designed to do.\u00a0<img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/11.gif\"/></div>"

No DM. No RP.\u00a0 No comradery.\u00a0 No common goals. No adventure.\u00a0 Just endless mindless H&amp;S. Geeesh.\u00a0 Now I'm digressing for sure...<br/>\n<br/>\n I get your drift about the intent of this build.\u00a0 The party healer primary focus blew right over my grey head.\u00a0 I thought it was supposed to be a damage sink to allow the other members some level of autonomy.\u00a0 Guess I'll need to add a category like \"tPvP\" for team PvP... though, TBH... this is the only build posted here that addresses that particular nuance.\u00a0 But NP.\u00a0 Done.</div>"

It is a nuance in nwn to play a SUPPORT class like Cleric as a SUPPORT character, when all of nwns classes [particularly the SUPPORT ones to make them playable in single player] are designed to blast everything to bits.<br/>\n<br/>\n Another favourite of mine was a high level constitution based Bard, similar style of play with less heals and lots more debuffs/curse/taunt/etc. Though it didn't really add much more to the table than a 26th level Bard did outside of [again] Antiworld, where Bard Song was nerfed, and levelled all the way to level 40 Bard. That one's probably a little too niche to post here.</span><br/>\n<br/>\n In the context of Antiworld, there was a Capture the flag game happening around you, and if you killed someone who wasn't carrying the flag and 5 levels outside your range, you'd be polymorphed into a penguin.

I'm taking exception to that. Having been out of D&amp;D for a fair old while (since before it became AD&amp;D, in fact), it was SP that got me back into the game: I'd never played a PC game before a friend gave me Baldur's Gate about 5 years ago, and I've been on a re-learning curve ever since. Baldur's, to Icewind, to Baldur's II, to Icewind II (which was odd but fun), to NwN, and from here...<br/>\n<br/>\n But regardless, there were only two reasons I didn't get into party-playing to start with. One was technical - actually, it wasn't - it was an elitist mentality from those in the know (possibly inadvertently) that intimidated a fan of the game with assumptions of knowledge, so that he ran shy of connecting with others. The second was about gaining experience with (as opposed to in) the way the game works, so I don't end up like the last kid picked in a sports team.<br/>\n<br/>\n I would ALWAYS prefer collaborative effort - I miss those days and nights of friends laughing and arguing around a table, and the shake of dice of many sides - and hopefully some of us over here will be getting to a VR version of that soon.

The marrow still remains warm.\u00a0 If a PC decides to ignore the D&amp;D theme, then the onus is on their head, not the head of the designer that fashioned the environment.<br/>\n<br/>\n Generally, PvP servers encourage autonomous power-building for 1v1 encounters.\u00a0 The flag capture and other team-oriented models are the exceptions rather than the rule.\u00a0 On some servers, team encounters are arranged by-appointment-only and are usually monitored by a DM who may or may not add some flavor to those episodes.\u00a0 tfr's fav server apparently encourages esprit de corps with its PvP model, a rarity.\u00a0 Now, if there were a minimum party size imposed on ALL PvP servers...<br/>\n<br/>\n @tfr:\u00a0 GoW is an offensive action and will not neutralize Evard tentacles since v1.69 (just clouds nowadays).\u00a0 Your cleric has been exposed and can expect a Bigby almost immediately now that targeting has been resumed.\u00a0 Checkmate! <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/15.gif\"/></div></div>"
