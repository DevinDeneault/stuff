      "content": "<div>Reason why this has never happened is because different players have different styles, different PWs/needs/settings/ETC. I myself for example am known for PvP builds, love to solo PvM as well, but there is a very real difference when it comes to PvE which is a different environs. To put it another way: what does a great job depending on play style and understanding of class types--aka melee/STR vs. sneak/DEX vs. arcane/X--a power build for sure, as in level 40 power won't necessarily do you well when playing against the environment if want to solo PvE. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a dfference when it comes to PvP 40 vs. actual playable power 1-40 PvM, though many of my own builds I do try to keep playability in mind, same \"school\" if you will as Mith (him and I loved our PvP, in particular \"playable power\" but sometimes I shoot for level 40 \"excellence\" and don't really care much about playability in turn, knowing it's a PvP/power build in turn (and clearly mark them as such---yes, builds should be marked playable range). That said, I have a \"do not go zone\" when it comes to XP burdens as that's not playable--no pain no gain yes, but XP burdens on top of that? Like I said, don't go there myself. Just don't, even if it means more power. On the other hand, if for PvP 40 ONLY I will note if for example that's what you want, then go some other race as if only interested in level 40 then an XP burden just don't matter. Others cringe at the thought, then, they are looking/building for 1-40 PvM/E with zero intention or desire to PvP, preferring playabilty over everything else and will not go in turn for power. And that is of course fine, as it's for PvM/E not PvP meaning, if it doesn't ever mature until level 40 and yet never going PvP so as to have no real life beyond 40, means never getting there so what is the point, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, there is a very real difference in terms of magic settings as well--as in, are we playing/talking about low magic, mid-magic or high magic settings? It really does matter. For the most part, builds can be and should be tweaked by players who alone know best the worlds on which they are playing and what \"gifts\" if any they will be getting (we build default here, as can't possibly know and cannot be expected to know the rules on every single PW out there, but if a player tells us clearly what is going on then we as the ECB builders can and will help them adjust as such: our pleasure). But to pick a hall of fame, for what? Best Ab? Best AC? Best whatever? Oh, we love challenges here don't get me wrong. But generally speaking, when gut everything to achieve \"best\" whatever, chances are it's not very playable. Doesn't mean it's not worthy--I mean, did I mention that we LOVE, LOVE, LOVE challenges here? 'Never such a thing as a \"Hall of Shame\" in turn, all ideas/concepts/builds are welcome, and we will help and do help the junior builders get there. In the end, if you actually enjoy playing something whatever that may be--not just a paper character, in theory but actual build you enjoy playing, then we'll help you tweak it to make it better so that not only do you enjoy playing it more as in more efficient but, guess what? Congrats. Others will enjoy playing your build as well, meaning, it gets to go on and adventure in far flung PWs all over the place which you yourself may never have dreamed of when you first conceptualized and started playing your character. But if you don't enjoy playing it, opposite is also true in that probably the case that others won't either. Unless they're in a different setting, different magic, etc. So like all things, it depends...no such thing as a Hall of Shame in turn (unless you count some of the me big uber what have you with an INT 2 pretending to be uber whatever in responding to some of the builds, typically some PvP wanna be who as it turns out never actually PvP'd but can spot those types as soon as they post -- was rare, haven't seen it in eons, but heh that's what an INT 2 will do, yes?

      "content": "<div>Hey, Tyr.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can't speak for others about this, but for me, when I envision a Hall of Fame in building, I don't envision this \"Guiness Book of Records\" thing that you talked about. For me, it's about building finesse and just raw power of the builds. Now, if we use a \"default setting\" when building, then why not use the same setting for comparing builds and voting? What you say is true, you can't really avoid biases such as playstyle, personal preference and stuff, but do we really have to? You are more inclined for melee PvP builds, so you'll naturally tend to pick some of such builds as your favourites. I'm more of a self-buffer type of player, with a bit of an attraction (but not a predilection) for casting, so my favourite builds will probably reflect that. But even if you aren't a fan of a certain type of build, you can and should recognize the finesse it took for certain builds to be crafted. I'll name some of my faves here, which include some of my own builds.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelee types:<br/>\n<br/>\n- The Charnel Lord by Grizz<br/>\n- Dwarven Wall of Wonders by StryderBlade<br/>\n- The Citadel by Grizz<br/>\n- Tear of the Dragon by Kail Pendragon and Conlaoch<br/>\n- The HOOD by me<br/>\n- Ugly Mug Hero by me<br/>\n<br/>\nCaster Types:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Exhalted Sorceress (forgot who made it)<br/>\n- Order of Jormungandr by Kail Pendragon<br/>\n- Champion of the Wilderness by me<br/>\n- Demolition Man by me<br/>\n- Speedy Caster by Whizard<br/>\n- The Dracolich of Autumn Twilight by Grizz<br/>\n<br/>\nSelf-buffer types:<br/>\n<br/>\n- The Magical Master by me<br/>\n- Blood &amp; Faith by Mith<br/>\n- The Hierophant by Mith<br/>\n- The Shadow Priest by me<br/>\n<br/>\nand some others I forgot the name to. Bard PM RDD (16/14/10, 14/16/10 or 20/10/10), Bard 26 Fighter 4 RDD 10, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nSneaker types (my least favourites):<br/>\n<br/>\nTiny Reaper by Grimnir<br/>\nThe Bane Crusher by me (a bit unplayable early on but can be tweaked if necessary)<br/>\nDeath says Yip (beautiful build, forgot who posted it and don't have time to look it up)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also other styles of builds and one specifically of my own that I've never published. It's sort of my take on Artemis Entreri from Bob Salvatore's books. I adapted it from my ED-SCV halfling into a drow fencer with a higher dex score and it was pretty cool. It was a Fighter 14 WM 7 Rogue 19 dex build, which can be played both as a sneaker or a defensive meleer. I can post both versions here, but not now cuz I am running out of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, it all boils down to personal preference, which is why some of my builds are in there too. I'm not saying that they're at the same level as the other builds, nor am I saying they aren't, but when you talk about favorites, then you can't be neutral, and out of all my builds, which is mostly what I play, these are my favourite ones. When I see a build from someone else such as the ones I have mentioned above, that I wouldn't tweak one bit to fit my playstyle, then I play that one too. Gotta go! <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

      "content": "<div>In my perspective on the history of this game, \"Hall of Fame\" builds are simply those that have proved the test of time, implemented first-hand by many players on diverse environments.\u00a0 Domination on a few servers or within a small sample of CC modules/campaigns does not justify elevating any build further than just \"appearing awesome\".\u00a0 And there are LOADS of those here!<br/>\n<br/>\n To expand further, from 2002 to approximately 2010 when the legacy ECB Guild was shut down along with the associated Bioware forums which housed that guild, the number of players were astounding for most of that 8 year period.\u00a0 The attendance of PWs was never higher (actually, they were all packed 24-7) and neither was the interest in new innovations. \u00a0 Would you believe that a popular server like WoG would be so jambed you wouldn't be able to join until someone left?\u00a0 Believe it. That was the norm in those days.\u00a0 So much latency due to overcrowded servers. A different world.\u00a0 The closing of the original forums/guilds didn't kill NWN but it diluted the subscribership severely.\u00a0 Judging from my own experience of losing gaming pals, I'd estimate only 3 out of 10 regular gamers were left still playing a mere year after the loss of Bioware support. I was one of those \"traitors\" and have returned to some extent since then but with nowhere near the commitment to play.\u00a0 Most divorces were final, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n Today is a pale remnant of that era.\u00a0 Comparatively, it's become impossible for such an all-encompassing fervor of that magnitude to reappear.\u00a0 Just too many innovative graphic engines in on-line gaming and too much competition for attendance.\u00a0 So what we are left with here is a combinations of a few ardent veterans along with newer players (complements of the digital market) in a relatively small NWN community that still hold a respectful level of enjoyment in the game, an appreciation that has extended its popularity as far as it has.<br/>\n<br/>\n Therefore, (after enduring the tedious deliberation of backstory) it would only be builds that we no longer have direct access to that fall into that category, the thoroughly-proved concepts with well-established success histories.\u00a0 As optimized as any build appears \"on paper\", until that concept has been severely tested in diverse situations and environments, its stature can only be approximated and its success anticipated.<br/>\n<br/>\n Let's not muddle this good idea up with some hair-brained, cosmetic Vote system.\u00a0 It's a waste of time and, TBH, totally impractical given the nature of the community's current size.\u00a0\u00a0 Hall of Fame in any frame of reference is based on volume of participation and duration of content.\u00a0 There's no value in trying to force the term into another context like \"ultimate optimization\" of a concept.<br/>\n<br/>\n Those Hall of Fame candidates should be obvious to all of us who have seen them perform universally and only those need be considered for conversion here for easy access (and, ideally to induce some further discussion in regards to new environments they may have found their way into since their zenith).</div>"

As with many things, glitter trumps substance far too often. I appreciate the backstory, and am only sorry that I came upon the game so late in the day. Maybe one day...<br/>\n<br/>\n That being said, I'd still like to throw my two-penneth-worth behind a couple of builds that are always a delight to play (feel free to ignore me): Order of the Wyrm - Empyre65 - Monk 25/Sorcerer 1/RDD 14; and Halfling Champion - Mick Dagger - Rogue 20/Fighter 6/CoT 14.<br/>\n<br/>\n As Tyr might say...Build ON</div>",

      "content": "<div>Hip, speaks some truths here...<br/>\n<br/>\n The Golden Era of NwN 1 followed a sudden cut off of the Original forums and then 2/10 players remained, maybe less than that. After that the NwN Vault closed and that was the final wound. So many pages of discussions about the modules and the PW's were gone. Now only 2/100 players remain, maybe less than that. The loss of the Legacy ECB is just the icing on the cake. Maybe it is for the best, people will move on to something else instead or maybe a small (and smart) company like Beamdog did in the case of Baldur's Gate will come and revive this game from its ashes. I hope for the later.<br/>\n<br/>\n On to the \"Hall of Fame\" builds, every one has its favorites, depending on its style and the server/modules that he/she plays. But to the trained eye, a really good build is always a really good build even if it isn't on that list. It doesn't take much for example to understand that Tyr's <strong>Dragon Slayer</strong> <strong>(Bard 8/ RDD 10/ COT 22)\u00a0 </strong>with it's hefty (46+2) AB, its brutal 45 (51) DC Devastating Critical and excellent saves across the board (and over 500 HP's as well) is a hot thing and a candidate for that list as well, or that Mick's <strong>Epic Scholar\u00a0 </strong>is the best (hands-down) April's Fool build ever to appear on these boards ;)<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

This is a straight-up mauler. High AC and immunities allow him to outlast his opponents, and his heavy hitting Halberd insure that he takes his opponents out. Dev Crit will allow him to wade easily through the mobs, and his beard will insure you look good doing it. Not that he really needs them, but the built-in Undead Army, Epic Warding, Epic Mage Armor and Greater Ruin allow him to take on even the toughest opponents a module has to offer. UMD will allow him to self-buff via scrolls or wands if needed.\nAlso, the Charnel Lord enjoys the luxury of several activated combat feats (Power Attack, Improved Disarm, Improved Knockdown). One could make a true AC monster by dropping either the IKD line or the Disarm and acquiring Expertise/Improved Expertise. With this in hand, one can gain a 70 AC without even using items (40 base+20EMA+10Improved Expertise).\nCheers!\n</details></div>"

One could go sword and shield and use expertise but this is best in a party where a teammate can do the damage, as one will lose all that AB and damage output. Other buffs like improved invisibility etc for 50% concealment were very helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo I think Mithdradates's original version was better? Maybe. The AB is simply really good already, and dropping 1AB for epic weapon specialisation is probably worth it.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother option might be to take a fighter 12 / WM 25 / Rogue 3 split to include uncanny dodge and 2d6 sneak attack at the cost of the epic toughness feat.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd love to make it a halfling for extra cheese by being able to wield a scimitar in two hands without losing any AB, adding 1AC and to +1 all saves, and having the maximal critical hit range in the game with keen weapon :) but then there are size penalties with knockdown to consider...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway this is a fantastic build. 15 years on and still a splendid build<br/>\n<br/>\n10/10 from me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Edit:</strong>\u00a0to be placed in the Hall of Fame Build thread when the moderators are able to do so</div>"

To that end, you could read many of the great guides we have in the Game Guides section.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally would categorize the builds by their functions, but there are always issues because many builds could fit multiple categories. I.E.: We could have, for example, an ARCANE SPELLSWORDS category, and another one called DIVINE SPELLSWORDS, but then there's my Magical Master, which fits both descriptions. We could have another category such as DEX-BASED EPIC-DODGERS, but then my Shadow Priest and Priest with a Secret Life would fit both that and Divine Spellswords as well. It's not doable by class, or class combo, because there are just too many builds and possible combinations. Perhaps if builds fit multiple categories, then they could be listed in both, provided they're good enough. Here's a rough list of the categories I would start with:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- Pure Arcane Casters (not pure as in 40 levels of the same class, but as in casting is what they use to kill things):<br/>\n2- Pure Divine Casters:<br/>\n3- Dragon Shapers:<br/>\n4- STR-based Arcane Spellswords:<br/>\n5- STR-based Divine Spellswords:<br/>\n6- DEX-based Arcane Spellswords:<br/>\n7- DEX-based Divine Spellswords:<br/>\n8- DEX-based Divine Spellbows:<br/>\n9- WIS-based Divine Spellbows:<br/>\n10- DEX-based Arcane Spellbows:<br/>\n11- Dual-caster Spellswords:<br/>\n12- Dual-caster Spellbows:<br/>\n13- STR-based Juggernauts:<br/>\n14- DEX-based Epic-Dodgers:<br/>\n15- DR Tanks:<br/>\n16- STR-based melee Bards<br/>\n17- DEX-based melee Bards<br/>\n18- General Shifters:<br/>\n19- Shifters focused on a specific shape:<br/>\n20- CHA-based Smiters.<br/>\n<br/>\netc.., etc.. etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are just too many categories!!! It would be A LOT of work!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's also the issue that, despite how good a build may be, knowing how to play it is paramount to extract the most value from it. I still remember talking to conlaoch, WAY BACK, when he told me in game that he had tried multiple Cleric builds, but was not able to get the juice from them that they could provide. I spent hours discussing strategies with him, explaining how he should manage his spellbook on a level-by-level basis, and then compiled that information and reformatted it to write my Cleric guide. He was basically memorizing lots of different buffs (including some that are sub-optimal at best), instead of multiple copies of the most important ones, like Divine Power, Divine favor, etc..., so he was constantly running out before the next rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis would have to be a long-term project that would need people to work on it for months on end to first come up with a good category system, and then look at ALL existing builds and define where they fit and what score they'd have in that category. I fear it may be biting off mother than we can chew to try to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!</div>",

      "content": "<div>Maybe the categorization could happen last or just not be done at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuilders could just pick their favorite builds, or the ones they consider the best. Perhaps at least 10 but no more than 30, or something like that? Then, once everyone has picked their favorite builds, they could be compiled into a single list and each builder would go through the list, giving each build a score from 1 to 10, maybe allowing for up to one-two decimal points, for example 9.5 or 9.53, etc. The average rating of all the builders could be the final rating for that individual build. If we wanted to be really fancy, we could implement some way for people to share their comments or evaluations of individual builds with others during the rating process.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess there should also be some qualification of what each rating would represent. For example, what does it take for a build to get a 10? A 9? An 8? etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, there should be an option to not rate a particular build if one is not familiar enough with the playstyle/classes involved. In that case, the final rating will merely be an average rating of all the people who did rate the build. We don't really want people guessing whether a build is good or not. They should have enough experience and knowledge to feel confident enough to rate the build in question.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps, there could be a minimum rating needed for a build to make the final cut. For example, maybe an average rating of 7 or higher might be considered necessary for a build to be included.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce all the qualifying builds are identified, they could be categorized however is deemed most appropriate, or even presented without categories, since the classes speak for themselves for the most part.<br/>\n<br/>\nRatings will always be subjective to some degree but that's the nature of these types of lists. Maybe there could be separate lists for PvM and PvP, or at least separate lists for 1-40 playable builds vs. level 40 builds. It might seem like a lot of work but we could just do one list at a time instead of trying to do them all at once. For example, first compile the best 1-40 PvM builds and then once that project is complete, compile the best PvP builds. Only people knowledgeable or confident enough need participate, so there would be no pressure on anyone. However, only the people who do participate would have their opinion counted in the final product.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, there could be a process put in place for how to add new builds to the list, as surely there will be more builds that people will want to include once the final list is published.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: All of that would be a lot of work but what about just an easily searchable list similar to:\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/index.html</a> but including all the builds on this site? That would make life easier when trying to find builds that have been done before. Maybe I'm just not very good at searching within this site.</div>"

      "content": "<div>It's great to see such enthusiasm for the game and our builds <em><em class=\"mention\">@unifiedworld</em></em> , and I take no joy in pouring cold water over your suggestion. But I'm going to.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly, in the ten years this Guild has been running, there are only some 361 builds combined in our completed builds forums (Level 40, 30, 20 and Free). This is not down to incompetence or laziness by our builders. Rather, it is the opposite: diligence in researching what has gone before to avoid duplication (though there may be some overlap from when the Legacy Archive was not available); and also not being prepared to post either untested or sub-standard builds with their names on them. They all serve their own purposes and may be relied upon to perform as advertised, or they would not be there. And if one or two slip through the net, the moderators will move them to the Unfinalized Builds forum.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, in what Library will you find a section titled \"Our Best Books\"? Or a restaurant having \"Our Best Dish\" on its menu? It is up to the customer to choose. Certainly, one can say \"this is the most borrowed book\" or \"our most popular dish\", but that is far from the same thing. And, indeed, individual librarians and chefs will have their own preferences, but that is what they are. If you want a recommendation, ask, nothing wrong with that at all. Otherwise, try different types of build, made for different purposes, they'll only add to your ability as a player as you have to develop different play-styles.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I'm afraid it's a non-runner as far as I'm concerned. Let alone the work involved in establishing such a thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, but as I said, it's good to see enthusiasm and fresh thoughts!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

      "content": "<div>I think that basically ANY build in any of the various categories i.e. level 20 builds/30/40 etc are at the top of the game and would do well in most modules. If they are not, it certainly would be brought up in the discussions of that build. It isn't like some one would post a garbage build, and it would be included in the level 40 builds !<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that I WOULD point out to you, is that you need to consider your environments carefully. There are MANY level 40 builds that are considered \"best\" by many, or among the best, that could turn out less than ideal.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider for example Webshaman \"Nightshade\" build, or a variant thereof. If you're aim is to take this through the official campaigns, I'd argue that it ISN\"T ideal, because it matures later than those modules go. Not that going pure monk in the OC can't be done, but taking a level of assassin earlier than level 31 (for UMD dump/etc) would reap many benefits. One would probably be better suited looking at the level 20 or level 30 build\u00a0 sections. Some of the \"Best\" builds out there mature rather late, and though they are quite powerful, they do sacrifice some playability along the way.</div>"

That creates all sorts of headaches, so it's better just to let people post their favorite builds. If 10 is too few, then whatever number is appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I was more knowledgeable in the game, I would post my own but I really don't know enough and haven't played enough (obviously, most of my experience is limited to the official campaigns) but I would love to hear from others as to which builds are their personal favorite.</div>"
