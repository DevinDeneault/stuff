      "content": "<div>Hello and welcome, Shinyasuo!<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing any of the three weapons you mention won't cripple the build, so don't worry.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason for taking scimitar is for critical hits. With a crit range of 15-20 (with the Improved Critical feat), you have a 30% chance of double damage with each hit. The three weapons you're looking at have a crit range of 19-20 (again with Imp Crit), which is a 10% chance. Just to complicate matters, though, if you <em>do</em> land a crit with a warhammer, you get triple damage rather than double. Also, with a morningstar, you land both bludgeoning and piercing damage (the other two are both \"just\" bludgeoning, while scimitar is \"just\" slashing). Morningstar is also a simple weapon, so you wouldn't need to take the Weapon Proficiency: Martial feat, giving you the option to take something else in its place, which is always nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe handy thing with bludgeoning damage is that it is less frequently resisted by enemies, and is particularly effective (generally) against those immune to crits, such as undead and constructs. Oh, and the three weapons you cite give you d8 damage (if I remember correctly), while the scimitar gives d6.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose what I'm saying is that it's swings and roundabouts: use any weapon that makes you feel good! For myself, I'd go for the morningstar for the two types of damage and the free feat it offers.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Btw, if you do go for morningstar, I'd take Blind Fight at level 1 and replace it at level 18 with Lightning Reflexes, which will help with what Mith recognises as a weak Reflex save. But that's just me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></em> Shall we assume you're the small one in your avatar pic? <span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83d\ude09</span></div>",
