I am playing this build on WoG, where the Ranger receives extra skill points. Average Joe has worked well solo and has been very forgiving of my newbie mistakes. I can't find a similar build in the archives; I suspect it is because Average Joe lacks the power that epic class levels provide.\u00a0 Experienced WoG players would have the knowledge and skills to play something better.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a Cleric heavy armour build that brings options to the table. It is designed to operate under invisibility (extended) with a high search and spot. As such the Trickery Domain is vital to this build, with your choice of the other domain. I chose Death because the Shadow is an excellent distraction at low levels. It's also nice to play an emo Dark Knight of Nerull :-P <br/>\n<br/>\nThe intention is to use spell slots for Sanctuary, Divine Favor, Invisibility, Improved Invisibility and healing. Other spells will be added according to the situation. High concentration allows for the defensive casting of spells in combat. It also has (hopefully) enough buffer to successfully cast if I forget to engage defensive casting in the heat of the battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nRanger provides Discipline, skill points, martial weapon proficiency, extra hit points and +1 BaB before 20 and that fourth attack. The Ranger Pet will be a convenient speed bump as part of an escape plan. Ranger can also provide Ultravision, Protection from Elements, Neutralise Poison and some minor Favored Enemy bonuses.<br/>\n<br/>\nRogue and Ranger skill points are utilised for spot, search, listen and set traps. Rogue also provides disable trap, open locks, tumble and UMD. Sneak Attack and Crippling Strike round out the build. The Rogue skills can be further boosted by the Trickery Domain. A lesser amulet / amulet of the Master is also on my shopping list. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn a party Average Joe could provide the key rogue skills, restorative spells, raise dead/resurrection and weak healing. \u00a0Knockdown, sneak attack and crippling strike would also be valuable in a fight. High discipline and STR would also allow Average Joe to be a Clayton's tank (the tank you have when you don't have a tank). <br/>\n<br/>\nAdvantages<br/>\n- +6 vs spells, UMD allows casting of 9th level spells (eventually) <br/>\n- high Discipline and +6 Tumble AC<br/>\n- Invisibility / Crippling Strike / Sneak attack combo<br/>\n- can set most deadly traps in heavy armour (take 20)<br/>\n- very forgiving for a new player exploring the dangerous WoG.<br/>\n- Slippery Mind (eventually)<br/>\n- 8th level Cleric spells (eventually)<br/>\n<br/>\nDisadvantages<br/>\n- easily dispellable<br/>\n- average AB for a multiclass<br/>\n- Reflex save could be better<br/>\n- lacks the punch of epic class levels<br/>\n- missing that defining epic level feat (i.e. devastating critical, epic damage reduction etc)<br/>\n<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Cleric(15), Rogue(13), Ranger(12), Human\nSTR: 15 (26)\nCON: 14\nINT: 14\n\u00a0\n01: Rogue(1): Blind Fight, Point Blank Shot\n03: Ranger(1): Weapon Focus: Longsword, Favored Enemy: Undeads, {Dual Wield}\n05: Rogue(2): {Evasion}\n07: Cleric(3)\n09: Ranger(3): Improved Knockdown\n11: Ranger(4)\n13: Cleric(5)\n15: Rogue(5): Toughness\n17: Ranger(6)\n19: Cleric(7)\n21: Cleric(8): Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword\n23: Rogue(8)\n25: Ranger(8)\n27: Rogue(10): Great Strength I, Crippling Strike, (STR=21)\n29: Cleric(10)\n31: Rogue(11)\n33: Cleric(12): Great Strength III, (STR=24)\n35: Rogue(12)\n37: Cleric(14)\n39: Rogue(13): Great Strength V, Slippery Mind, (STR=26)\n\u00a0\nSkillpoints: 335\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +6, Traps: +2\nAB (max, naked): 37 (melee), 27 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Cleric(8),Ranger(3)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n01: Appraise(4), Disable Trap(4), Heal(4), Listen(4), Lore(4), Open Lock(4), Search(4), Set Trap(4), Spot(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), \n03: Concentration(1), Discipline(4), Listen(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Spot(1), \n05: Appraise(1), Disable Trap(3), Open Lock(3), Set Trap(1), Tumble(2), UMD(2), \n07: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), \n09: Concentration(1), Discipline(3), Listen(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Spot(2), \n11: Concentration(1), Discipline(3), Listen(1), Search(1), Set Trap(2), Spot(1), \n13: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(1), \n15: Appraise(1), Disable Trap(3), Open Lock(2), Search(1), Tumble(2), UMD(3), \n17: Concentration(1), Discipline(3), Listen(1), Search(2), Set Trap(1), Spot(2), \n19: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(1), \n21: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(2), \n23: Disable Trap(3), Open Lock(2), Search(2), Tumble(2), UMD(2), \n25: Concentration(1), Discipline(5), Listen(2), Search(1), Spot(1), \n27: Disable Trap(1), Open Lock(2), Search(1), Tumble(2), UMD(3), \n29: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(2), \n31: Disable Trap(3), Open Lock(2), Tumble(2), UMD(4), \n33: Spellcraft(5), \n35: Disable Trap(2), Open Lock(2), Search(2), Spot(1), Tumble(3), UMD(3), \n37: \n39: Disable Trap(3), Listen(1), Open Lock(3), Search(1), Tumble(3), UMD(2), \n</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Very frustrating when one has 5 hours to rest and it's a long walk back to Borderkeep. So I'm going to look at a different Cleric domain.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
