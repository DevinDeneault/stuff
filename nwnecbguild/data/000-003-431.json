      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">I would like to play a Pm build that eventually gets a Demi Lich and I have been looking at different builds. To get the 30 PM levels it seems very difficult to obtain any type of decent AB so I decided to take as many Wiz levels as i could and try to make a char that can buff its summons and has a few good spell DCs. I appreciate it will only have a caster level of 9 but I think it will do ok against melee types.<br/>\nI have taken SP/GSP and ESP to get a little more which could help against non boss types, and the SF/GSF and ESF feats are to up my DCs for Conj and Necro spells which will give me a few decent offensive spells. <br/>\nI will obvioulsy rely on summons from my early teens and I have chosen to take all the Epic Spells rather than Energy reduction feats so I have more summons in an emergency and for killing off with GR.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 8<br/>\nDEX: 16<br/>\nCON: 12<br/>\nWIS:

<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy worry is that I am not gong to have enough punch espcially in the middle of its life and that I am perhaps putting too much into INT for the DC and leaving me with less DEX and reduced AC. That also makes m wonder if I do inc dex whether I should go Finesse and Focus and make some attempt at hitting things? Should I take Craft Wand to have more spells at my disposal and to help buff my summons?<br/>\nI took LoH rather than toughness and feel it is much of a muchness for which would help more. I now think maybe Hellball is not as useful as taking ESF Conj? <br/>\n<br/>\nMy primary goal is to obtain the Demi Lich, the rest I can live with or without so long as it gets me to my primary goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts? Help? Advice? Anyone tried anything similar? I looked at the old Epi Build search engine and found nothing with 30 PM levels that was similar or helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nthx in advance....<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It would also be difficult to choose two feats to drop for Exp and Imp Exp. I feel the SP line is necessary because of only having 9 caster levels, but after mid levels the SP wont really be helpful except against lower level mobs. I can't see too many bosses being troubled by my spells that are opposed by SR. It is also why I went SF in two schools to get my DCs a bit higher for spells such as Horrid Wilting, Wail of the Banshee, etc. Scrolls are easy to obtain so getting spells wont be a problem and things such as Mords (the breach effect) and Time Stop which I will use a lot are not opposed so caster level isn't so much of an issue. I also considered changing one SF line to evocation but feel if I am tactical with my spell choice I can get by even with only 9(15) effective caster levels. I could however, drop LoH and my rogue level to take Wizard 10 and get another feat to add SF and GSF Evocation. I would lose my trap skills and UMD, but in all honesty I am a useless rogue player and always forget or do something that wastes the time I spend setting traps.The UMD would not be such a great loss either because most gear I would use I can use without it. The loss of some Tumble wouldn't be good though. Not convinced by my own argument there though!!!!<br/>\nAm I right in that line of thought?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
