      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Was musing about arcane casters (which, except for Bard, I rarely play) and thinking about how the right combo of HP, damage shields and DR, could make a damned fine melee arcanist. \u00a0JUST to make it interesting for me, I wrapped my ideas around incorporating the most worthless (IMO) Prestige Class in the game - Purple Dragon Knight - for kicks, giggles and as a way to add AB without the cheesiness of only using a few levels of a Prestige Class.<br/>\n<br/>\n The toon has to get hit enough to let the shields damage the attacker, yet have enough HP to survive and will probably need other ways to damage the bad guy besides the shields (either a big sword or a high damage spell), so that speaks Dwarf to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n I kicked around two quick thoughts - W25/DD10/PDK5 \"Purple Defender of Death!\" with Mestil's Acid Sheath, Dwarven Defender DR, \u00a0Elemental Shield, IGMS &amp; Finger of Death to neutralize baddies &amp; BD25/RDD10/PDK5 \"Purple Dragon of Death!\" with extended Wounding Whispers, EDR 3, Full Bard song &amp; AB in the 40s. \u00a0I built both versions but didn't look to optimize. \u00a0I also have NO IDEA as to whether any of the PDK feats will be useful.<br/>\n<br/>\n Additionally, a BD25/DD10/PDK5 (not RDD) seems like it would work best, except there'd be at least 2 alignment changes, which I do not want.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#4C5D77\">1) PvM</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color:#4C5D77\">2) Level cap - 40</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color:#4C5D77\">3) Race preference - Dwarf - I'm starting to like the buggers!</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color:#4C5D77\">4) Class preference - See above - must use PDK.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color:#4C5D77\">5) Melee preference - sword/board or 2-hander</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color:#4C5D77\">6) Range preference - N/A</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color:#4C5D77\">7) Weapon preference - Morningstar or Spear (unless you can work in another Weapon Proficiency - this guy is feat-starved.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color:#4C5D77\">8) Maximum item enhancement - +5</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color:#4C5D77\">9) Spellcasting - Damage Shields. buffs and (if Wiz/Sorc) Bigby's/Fingers of Death.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color:#4C5D77\">10) Custom factors - none, except want to use PDK</span><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
