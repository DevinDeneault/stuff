      "content": "<div>The Shadow Avenger, is a strength-based Assassin that comes with all the tools available for war, he has discipline, decent saving throws, can sneak with full plate ON, has umd of course and 11 dice of sneak attack to go with IKD. His Death Attack is a moderate-to-good 33 (39) but with the mastering of blades that he has, it won't take long for his enemies to fall either way. He is basically an Assassin on top of an already accomplished Weapon Master, and strength-based too, so his attacks will hurt no-matter-what. His Armour Class is good as you would expect from a warrior with full plate and full tumble and expertise surely helps here too, but if you want more then change the weapon to a battle-axe and take a large shield with you. The idea for this build came a while back when the Grandfather (Mick) was making his build for the themed Baldur's Gate NPC \"Shar-Teel\" so, kudos for originality goes to him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://i1375.photobucket.com/albums/ag474/valerfor/Bayushi_Konitsu_zps6jj5rcqi.jpg\"/><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:120%;line-height:normal\"><strong>SHADOW AVENGER: (FTR 12/ ASS 21/ WM 7)</strong></span><br/>\n<br/>\n RACE: Human<br/>\n ALIGNMENT: LE<br/>\n PLAYABILITY: PvM 1-40<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:100%;line-height:normal\"><strong>STARTING/ ENDING STATS:</strong></span><br/>\n STR \u2013\u00a0 17 (30)<br/>\n DEX \u2013\u00a0 13<br/>\n CON \u2013 14<br/>\n INT \u2013\u00a0\u00a0 14<br/>\n WIS -\u00a0 08<br/>\n CHA \u2013 08<br/>\n<br/>\n Hit Points: 396<br/>\n<br/>\n Skill Points: 257\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Discipline: 43 (53)<br/>\n Spellcraft: 18 (20) cc<br/>\n Tumble: 40 (41)<br/>\n UMD: 30 (29)<br/>\n Intimidate: 4 (3) cc<br/>\n Hide: 42 (53) cc/ full<br/>\n Move Silently: 42 (53) cc/ full<br/>\n<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fort/Ref/Will): 27/ 23/ 21 \u2192 31/ 27/ 25 (saves Vs spells)<br/>\n<br/>\n Naked/ Armoured AC: 21/ 31 (Plate Armour &amp; Large Shield)/ 36 (w/ Expertise)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n BAB: 29 (Four Attacks)<br/>\n<br/>\n AB: +44/ +39/ +34/ +29 (Greataxe)<br/>\n<br/>\n DMG: 1D12 +21 / 17-20 X4 (Greataxe)<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<br/>\n Spellcasting: Assassin Spell-Like Abilities plus UMD<br/>\n \u00a0<br/>\n Death Attack DC: 33 (39) /Sneak Attack: 11d6 &amp; IKD<br/>\n<br/>\n Stealth In Full Plate: (45)/ With Large Shield (43)<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:100%;line-height:normal\"><strong>LEVELING GUIDE:</strong></span><br/>\n 01) Fighter (01): WF: Greataxe, Expertise, Knockdown<br/>\n 02) Fighter (02): Blind Fighting<br/>\n 03) Fighter (03): Dodge<br/>\n 04) Fighter (04): WS: Greataxe<br/>\n 05) Fighter (05):<br/>\n 06) Fighter (06): Spring Attack, Mobility<br/>\n 07) Fighter (07):<br/>\n 08) Fighter (08): Whirlwind Attack<br/>\n 09) Weapon Master (01): Improved Knockdown<br/>\n 10) Weapon Master (02):<br/>\n 11) Weapon Master (03):<br/>\n 12) Weapon Master (04): IC: Greataxe<br/>\n 13) Weapon Master (05):<br/>\n 14) Weapon Master (06):<br/>\n 15) Weapon Master (07): Iron Will<br/>\n 16) Assassin (01):<br/>\n 17) Assassin (02):<br/>\n 18) Assassin (03): Great Fortitude<br/>\n 19) Assassin (04):<br/>\n 20) Fighter (09):<br/>\n 21) Fighter (10): EWF: Greataxe, EWS: Greataxe<br/>\n 22) Assassin (05):<br/>\n 23) Assassin (06):<br/>\n 24) Assassin (07): Armour Skin<br/>\n 25) Assassin (08):<br/>\n 26) Assassin (09):<br/>\n 27) Assassin (10): Epic Fortitude<br/>\n 28) Assassin (11):<br/>\n 29) Assassin (12):<br/>\n 30) Fighter (11): Epic Will<br/>\n 31) Assassin (13):<br/>\n 32) Assassin (14): ESF: Move Silently<br/>\n 33) Assassin (15): Great Strength I<br/>\n 34) Assassin (16):<br/>\n 35) Assassin (17):<br/>\n 36) Assassin (18): ESF: Hide, Great Strength II<br/>\n 37) Assassin (19):<br/>\n 38) Assassin (20):<br/>\n 39) Assassin (21): Great Strength III<br/>\n 40) Fighter (12): Epic Prowess</div>"

      "content": "<div>Funny that you should post this, now, as I'm designing a sneak attacker build. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm not sure that I understand the full benefits of combining sneak attack damage with better crits in the same build. What you can't sneak attack is going to be (most of the time) immune to critical hits (unless you're unable to KD or IKD in 1vs1 battles). Is this doubled-up way of dealing damage worth the weapon master feat investments?<br/>\n<br/>\n Like the choice of weapon and style,<br/>\n<br/>\n -JimDandy</div>"

      "content": "<div>What you cannot crit, you will defeat fast with your ews &amp; str alone, in what you can crit, it's basically an overkill. The target simply <em>melts </em>under the compined sneaks &amp; ews &amp; str-based dmg &amp; umd e.t.c. And i know you like the overkills. And if you want moar power, simply switch the saving boosters with improved disarm pre-epics and 2 more great-str in epic levels. But why do that, the build is devastating enough already, so let it be safe as it can be ;-)</div>"

      "content": "<div>Well, Valerfor, you've just crapped on my strawberries! I just posted a couple of days ago on the general discussion board that I was thinking about building a Strength-based Assassin - driven mostly by the fact that everything worth the slaying (in the OC and related campaigns) has True Seeing, so I was trying to counter that with a bear-like Assassin who didn't need to worry about being noticed too much. It was to have been my second attempt at a build (if you remember Mazzy's tough birth), but you've gone and provided the ideal answer!<br/>\n<br/>\n Actually - kudos - a great build.<br/>\n<br/>\n And anyway, I was moving into a Barbarian/Ranger mix-up, with something like Rogue or Druid thrown in, so no harm, no foul!</div>",

      "content": "<div>This build has much in common with \"Code name Stingray\" that also is a strength based assassin with AB +44 and has a DA DC close to this one, even if you use completely different classes. In that thread we also had a discussion and an analysis of Assassin vs Rogue in this kind of builds. <br/>\n This one is a better stalker with 2 attacks in the first flurry, even if stalking is not your number 1 priority with these builds. The melee presence is definitely there. The hitpoints are a little low for tanking, but Improved invisibility helps with 50% concealment ( temporary SCV ). The saves are good. This is a strong flanker and IKD helps land DA bonus damage when you go toe to toe with hostile creatures. Tumble gives AC, but also helps you move around in combat without being hit. <br/>\n This character focuses in Greataxe and the AC without shield is 29. That is OK, but not more. I know you can grab a shield and a one-hander, but then your AB is +40. So perhaps a focus in a one hander would be better here. After all you don't actually need the extra damage that the two-hander gives and the stealth skills are still quite OK with a shield, as long as you don't use a tower.<br/>\n<br/>\n You mention my Shar-Teel build as a source of inspiration. Thank you Val :)  <br/>\n I use assassin as minor class in that strength build to get full Tumble, Improved invisibility and UMD.</div>",
