      "content": "<div>Hail Darktooth,<br/>\nUnder standard rules, prestige classes are not considered by the routine which calculates XP penalties. It's like the class doesn't exist. This has 2 implications:<br/>\n1 - a human with a prestige class cannot have a XP penalty.<br/>\n2 - any character with 2 prestige classes cannot have a XP penalty.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this sufficiently answers your question!</div>"
