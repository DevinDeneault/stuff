No listed Slashing immunity, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo unless Arkhalia has customized the Barghest Whelp, and not following NWN/D20 Barghest Whelp, then with a +25 Modified buffed AB, I should be hitting, damaging, killing these things.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso as a 10th to 14th level encounter, no reason to give them immunity to my weapon, Kama, DR, etc, and just use the NWN D20 no DR, etc, version.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am probably going to have to go up 1 level to 13 level, get a +4 Kama, Use Divine Favor, Divine Power, Bulls Str, Magic Weapon, Cats Grace, Bless, Prayer, Aid, No Darkfire(Darkfire only works on non magical weapons), etc, and hope that works.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that doesnt work, maybe somebody in the game can tell me what will work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if not then skip it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 9k xp until lev 13, just only need to kill about 100 Umberhulks at about 80 xp each to get to 13th lev, get Divine Power</div>"

You need to check the actual logs to look at the DI/DR.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn vanilla NWN both Battletide and Divine Favour ignore DI/DR, but at your level this will mean only 2 damage per hit. Try using a different damage type (mace/sling for bludgeoning, shortsword/longbow for piercing), use elemental damage (although outsiders usually have elemental DI/DR), and try Searing Light or other damage spells. If using a different damage type works then I recommend carrying multiple types of weapons so you don't have a problem with DI/DR again.</div>"
