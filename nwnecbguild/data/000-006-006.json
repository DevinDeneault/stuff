      "content": "<div>by Mithdradates<br/>\n<br/>\nSince I don't think Mith is patrolling these boards, I wanted to make sure this classic build ported over.  It sounds like there are quite a few \"newer\" players who are finding their way back to NWN, and in case they missed it the first time, here it is again.  I'm surprised Avado didn't post this....   <br/>\n<br/>\nAll text below is the original from Mith.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Playable from level 1 to 40... PVM or PVP</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nWith my recent Knight of Bahamut build, this build was inevitable. I wanted to make use of the RDD strength bonus to create a build that got a warrior level AB with only 3 attacks, so that divine power could add another attack at the higher AB bonus. The build turns out very powerful, but virtually every incarnation of these classes ends up being very powerful. There are a few builds with this class distribution, but none of them get an AB this high and remain relatively undispellable. It's no good to spend 5 minutes buffing only have them all stripped by a scroll of greater dispel or MD. The build will do best in no to mid magic settings, and should remain competitive in higher magic settings (maybe up to +12 or around there).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis build is a testament to the disgusting synergy of power between the Cleric and the RDD, and the general lack of balance between classes. The cleric gets way too many powerful buffing spells (IMHO divine favor should not have been added and harm should have had a fortitude save), and the RDD (IMHO should not have been added in the expansions) gets 14 attribute boosts in 10 levels as well as 4 points of AC. On top of this, add in the Bard's skill list and it is difficult not to get an obscenely powerful character with this class combo.<br/>\n<br/>\nI chose War domain for Cat's Grace and Aura of Vitality over the almost standard Trickery. Generally it's easier to find a scroll of improved invisibility than a scroll of aura of vitality.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdvantages<br/>\n<br/>\n-Good AB. Desipite only having a 25 BAB, he has a 42 AB with a Scimitar. With buffs he can easily get a 66 without magic items, 68 with +4 Strength boost from items.<br/>\n-3 Maximum AB attacks. With Haste and Divine Power, this build gets 3 attacks at the maximum AB bonus.<br/>\n-Good Damage. He does 13+1D6 points of damage unbuffed. With buffs he does 40+2D6 points of damage on a regular hit.<br/>\n-Good AC. Without any magic items he can get a 59 AC (71 AC if he abuses the stacking of UEF). Note that War domain was chosen for Aura of Vitality and Cat's Grace, if good Attribute boosting equipment is available he could use Trickery domain instead and pick up improved invisibility.<br/>\n-Level 9 cleric spells with a caster level of 26. He has a ton of buffs, healing magic, plus harm and word of faith. He only has to worry about Mordenkainen's Disjunction removing his buffs.<br/>\n-Ability to use mage scrolls and equipment from other classes. He has a high UMD to use equipment from other classes and as a Bard he can use mage scrolls without UMD checks.<br/>\n-Immunity to Fire and Sleep and Paralysis.<br/>\n-Improved Knockdown. Always useful against casters and hard hitting opponents.<br/>\n<br/>\nDisadvantages<br/>\n<br/>\n-Mediocre Hitpoints. With Aid, Endurance and Aura of Vitality he'll end up with over 600 hitpoints.<br/>\n-Low Reflex Saving throw and mediocre Will and Fortitude Saves. Vs. Spells the Will and Fortitude saves are okay, he can also cast an extended clarity to help with will saves and protection from negative energy, death ward and/or undeath's eternal foe will help with the fortitude save. The Reflex Save is a weak point, though freedom of movement will help a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Blood and Faith</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nRace Human<br/>\n<br/>\nAlignment Any non lawful<br/>\n<br/>\nBase Attributes<br/>\nSTR 16<br/>\nDEX 8<br/>\nCON 12<br/>\nINT 14<br/>\nWIS 16<br/>\nCHA 8<br/>\n<br/>\nAttribute Bonuses<br/>\nLevels 4, 8 and 12 Increase Wisdom<br/>\nLevels 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36 and 40 Increase Strength<br/>\n<br/>\nFinal Level Distribution<br/>\nBard 4<br/>\nCleric 26<br/>\nRed Dragon Disciple 10<br/>\n<br/>\nClerical Domains<br/>\nWar and Travel<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel Distribution and Feats<br/>\nLevel 1: (Cleric 1): Toughness, Weapon Proficiency (Martial)<br/>\nLevel 2: (Cleric 2)<br/>\nLevel 3: (Cleric 3): Weapon Focus (Scimitar)<br/>\nLevel 4: (Cleric 4)<br/>\nLevel 5: (Cleric 5)<br/>\nLevel 6: (Cleric 6): Knockdown<br/>\nLevel 7: (Cleric 7)<br/>\nLevel 8: (Cleric 8 )<br/>\nLevel 9: (Cleric 9): Extend Spell<br/>\nLevel 10: (Cleric 10)<br/>\nLevel 11: (Cleric 11)<br/>\nLevel 12: (Cleric 12): Improved Knockdown<br/>\nLevel 13: (Cleric 13)<br/>\nLevel 14: (Cleric 14)<br/>\nLevel 15: (Cleric 15): Improved Critical (Scimitar)<br/>\nLevel 16: (Cleric 16)<br/>\nLevel 17: (Cleric 17)<br/>\nLevel 18: (Cleric 18 ): Blind-Fight<br/>\nLevel 19: (Cleric 19)<br/>\nLevel 20: (Cleric 20)<br/>\nLevel 21: (Cleric 21): Epic Weapon Focus (Scimitar)<br/>\nLevel 22: (Bard 1)<br/>\nLevel 23: (Red Dragon Disciple 1)<br/>\nLevel 24: (Red Dragon Disciple 2): Epic Prowess<br/>\nLevel 25: (Red Dragon Disciple 3)<br/>\nLevel 26: (Red Dragon Disciple 4)<br/>\nLevel 27: (Bard 2): Great Strength I<br/>\nLevel 28: (Red Dragon Disciple 5)<br/>\nLevel 29: (Red Dragon Disciple 6)<br/>\nLevel 30: (Red Dragon Disciple 7): Great Strength II<br/>\nLevel 31: (Red Dragon Disciple 8 )<br/>\nLevel 32: (Bard 3)<br/>\nLevel 33: (Red Dragon Disciple 9): Great Strength III<br/>\nLevel 34: (Red Dragon Disciple 10)<br/>\nLevel 35: (Cleric 22)<br/>\nLevel 36: (Cleric 23): Armor Skin, Great Strength IV<br/>\nLevel 37: (Cleric 24)<br/>\nLevel 38: (Cleric 25)<br/>\nLevel 39: (Cleric 26): Great Wisdom I, Great Strength V<br/>\nLevel 40: (Bard 4)<br/>\n<br/>\nFinal Attributes<br/>\nSTR 36<br/>\nDEX 8<br/>\nCON 14<br/>\nINT 16<br/>\nWIS 20<br/>\nCHA 10<br/>\n<br/>\nAB and Damage<br/>\n(no buffs, mundane Scimitar)<br/>\n42/37/32 13+1D6 (15-20 x2)<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>Note:  As of patch 1.69, you no longer can obtain 3 attacks at full BAB, only 2.

In fact, the whole spell is now no longer useful for AC boosting. as it gives DEFLECTION AC, and less than Shield of Faith. The immunities are still nice, but the AC bonus is now obsolete.

My first instinct would be to say Cleric 25 Bard 5 RDD 10 dropping your Wisdom to 19, but part of me wonders if nothing better can be accomplished, like maybe Cleric 24 Bard 6 RDD 10, which would still grant you undispellability, but with more bard, more skill points as well.. Honestly, I don't know, I'd say at first glance that Cleric 24 Bard 6 RDD 10 would be the second-best alternative.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

      "content": "<div>having played this build on a bunch of high- and low-magic PWs, my first thought was the same as max's - drop cleric 25 and wis to 19.  But thinking about it, even in +5 environment, you can easily cap to the +20 max, so you might consider dropping 1 str and keeping 20 wis, but that depends on whether and extra 1st and 5th lvl spell (diff between 19 and 20) or 3rd and 7th (diff between 31 and 32) is worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a +5 weapon (either permanent or GMW) and extended bless and aid, you're at +7 for super-long term buff.  Ext Divine Power, prayer, and Battletide will last 50 rounds, getting you up to +18 for long/medium term buff.  Then Ext Divine favor brings you up to +20 for short-term (2 turns).  Depending on dispelling amounts, an AB of 67 (assume +12 cap to str) might be just as effective as 68 and you might find the extra spells worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI probably wouldn't and would end up with the first thought, but something to think about.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBard 6 over 5 doesn't give you much, a couple more skillpoints from one level; I'd much rather have the extra 2 rounds for the Caster Level/Round buffs than 2 more skill points.</div>"

Cleric 26 gives you a feat and makes you immune to Greater Dispelling (actually, it's 25 levels in EE, and 24 in regular NWN). Cleric 27 would only grant you 1 extra Caster level to add when trying to penetrate Spell Resistance, and nothing else. And if you did do that, you'd need to delay Bard 3 to Level 37, making it so you would have less skill dumps throughout your leveling process. I don't see pretty much any situation where you'd actually prefer casting against spell-resistant enemies instead of bashing their skulls with your insane AB and damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for your second comment, I will try to be more specific. Webbie has mentioned the buffs, which is true, they scale with Cleric levels, but also there is the fact that in your early levels, you don't really use physical combat that much. You mostly use summon creature, then Animate Dead buffed with GMW, Bless, Aid and Darkfire, and only then, from level 12 onward, you slowly transition into buffing yourself and fighting in melee. Sure you can do it before, but it's sub-optimal to say the least. At Cleric 9, all your buffs are at +3, and at Cleric 10 you get a Skeleton Chieftain with 1 cast of a level 3 spell. If you have Expertise, you can tank while it wrecks the enemies from behind, as your AC should be quite high in a Full Plate. If you'd like, I wrote a guide on Clerics where I explain in depth how I normally level them. It's in the Game Guides section.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally, Blind Fight has nothing to do with detection. It just helps you hit concealed enemies (mostly from Improved Invisibility, Ghostly Visage and the likes). It would indeed be nice to have detection skills, but on a build with 26 Cleric levels, 10 RDD levels and only 4 Bard levels, you only have so many skill points. Something has to give, and in this case, UMD's usefulness far outclasses the other skills, since one casting of True Seeing already allows you to detect all hidden and invisible creatures in vanilla NWN (not on WoG).<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this contributes to the conversation. Cheers!</div>",

      "content": "<div>Thanks a lot to both Mr. Web and Mr. Kane.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me re-write your insights as a recap:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe build goes Bard 4 instead of Bard 2 or 3 just because those same bunch of levels in Cleric would do mostly nothing besides improving spell penetration on a build that doesn't focus on that, and besides, it helps to increase the regularity of those skill dumps.<br/>\n<br/>\nRobbing a Cleric level pre-epic is a terrible idea, not only decreases AB but the class doesn't need help from Tumble or Disciple <em>AT ALL</em>. On the re-lecture of Kane's Cleric guide it is clear that the class can relay on buffs, summons and a <em>myriad</em> of tricks for leveling, all dependent on securing access to one's spells, no delays, no excuses.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally and apparently UMD trumps all, detection skills be damned.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a side note, when talking about Blind-Fight I was referring at the synergy with Listen (that of negating flat-footed status from a listened invisible attacker) and since we also have <em>some</em> Wisdom it seemed natural to just go with that. Also, I grossly undervalued UMD as shown, so I'll play more with skill and/or bother you some other time with the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again, you've been truly helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!</div>"

Hope you're doing well!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a bit like comparing apples and oranges. I do think the Shadow Priest is better than the Priest of Shadows for solo play, but that's only because Yar Stardawg himself said that his goal with the build was to make a \"last man standing\" kind of PC to raise / heal back up fallen allies, whereas the Shadow Priest was made to steamroll everything it encounters with attacks while still having amazing AC and Epic Dodge. Both these builds focus more on balancing offense and defence, whereas Blood &amp; Faith is a wonderful offensive monster, the best of them all at it. So, instead of just ending there, I will also add my <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/viewtopic.php?p=25077#p25077\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Priest with a Secret Life</a> to the mix and compare them according to several criteria:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- Offensive prowess:\u00a0<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01st place: Myth's Blood &amp; Faith<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02nd place: Priest with a Secret Life<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a03rd place: Shadow Priest<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a04th place: Priest of Shadows<br/>\n<br/>\n2- Survivability:<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01st place: Shadow Priest<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02nd place: Priest of Shadows (very close second)<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a03rd place: Priest with a Secret Life<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a04th place: Myth's Blood &amp; Faith<br/>\n<br/>\n3- Versatility:<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01st place: Priest with a Secret Life<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02nd place: Myth's Blood &amp; Faith<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a03rd place: Priest of Shadows<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a04th place: Shadow Priest<br/>\n<br/>\n4- Beginner-friendliness:<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01st place: Myth's Blood &amp; Faith<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02nd place: Priest of Shadows (because he's meant for party play)<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a03rd place:\u00a0Shadow Priest<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a04th place: Priest with a Secret Life<br/>\n<br/>\nExplaining the above (today I've got some free time LOL), Myth's Blood &amp; Faith is a STR-based build with all Cleric buffs, so its offensive potential is through the roof, then we have Priest with a Secret Life because of Sneak Attack and Trap Skills, then the Shadow Priest because of its higher DEX and combat focus compared to the Priest of Shadows, which comes in last.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding survivability, the Shadow Priest and the Priest of Shadows are almost tied in first place, with the minor difference that the Shadow Priest focuses on DEX, while the other splits between WIS and DEX, so the Shadow Priest will kill things faster with attacks, making him slightly more likely to survive than the Priest of Shadows, because dead enemies don't fight back.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen in versatility, both builds that have UMD take the forefront, but the Priest with a Secret Life has trap skills, which Myth's Blood &amp; Faith doesn't, so he wins in a tie-breaker. The Priest of Shadows has more versatility than the Shadow Priest because of the aforementioned split focus between WIS and DEX, allowing him to make better use of spells than his counterpart in some situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally, in terms of beginner-friendliness, the easiest thing to do is to pick up a full plate, a shield and a big hammer, then buff up and go crack some skulls, so Myth's Blood&amp; Faith does have a huge advantage here. Not much thinking to do with how you play. Me smash you works just fine. Then the Priest of Shadows goes second because anything is easier in a party than soloing. Then we have the Shadow Priest, who can abuse Darkness / HiPS shenanigans, stealth, hit and run strategies, etc. These aren't exactly advanced strategies, but they also aren't beginner ones. And then last we have the Priest with a Secret Life, who has no HiPS to lean back on, so needs to abuse Darkness (but with no stealth skills), can use traps, which is a more advanced tactical playstyle to use properly, and also has UMD, which means the sky is the limit in terms of what tools he can use to kill stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this answers your question.<br/>\nCheers!</div>",
