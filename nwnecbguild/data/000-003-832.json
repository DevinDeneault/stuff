Even a 5% chance of that happening (ie an opponent rolling a 1) it seems pretty strong. IF its true.<br/>\n<br/>\nRE double devastating critical there's a thread entitled 'Grom's Challenge' and I've drawn inspiration from a player called Papa Lenin on WoG, who was challenged by a certain other player that a pure fighter couldn't get to level 40 on World of Greyhawk. He succeeded by going double dev crit. (I understand Valerfor succeeded with a pure fighter without going dev crit but I'm not quite at the heights of that type of skill.) He gets an extra 3AB and 6 damage with the longbows from his feats, but I'm hoping that extended Divine Power / Divine Favor / Bless / Aid / Prayer / Battletide / Owl's Wisdom etc will more than compensate plus the ability to cast GMW on bows and darkfire on arrows (this was coded in WoG)<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>OK, there we go, the dust fell down, and here we got a lone survivor\u00a0<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></details></div>"

      "content": "<div>With capped AB bonus and wisdom, you can stretch a naked AB of +30 all the way to +56. Clerics, overpowered as they are, can achieve a lot of that from self buffs, but are better at buffing melee weapons than ranged ones. If I recall correctly, WoG let several of the melee only spells work on ranged weapons as well.<br/>\nUnless the environment is really harsh you should be able to do ranged damage against mobs, at least. It is always good to have a ranged weapon available, and zen is nice to have for a strength based cleric, if you can afford the feat. <br/>\nIf ranged dev crit is worth it with this low AB is questionable at best. Of course one can say that it depends on what you are up against and how you want to play. But with a cleric, powerful as they are, I would see it more as a gimmick than a serious combat style.</div>",

But in a build made for level 40 I agree with taking wisdom late for better end game power.</div>",

      "content": "<div>Thanks Mick Stag and Valerfor for the comments!<br/>\n<br/>\nThat feedback is very valuable!\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes time and effort to play through and create a character so it's always worth trying one's best to optimise as much as possible before playing through them.<br/>\n<br/>\nValerfor you are spot on - I forgot to include extend spell when making the build so I have included this now and unfortunately delayed knockdown till later in the build. I'll sort out the spellcraft skill points a bit later, I think I have gone too heavy on the detection skill points. Bastard swords have a certain style for sure and I have certainly picked up some quite nice Bastard Swords in WoG and Aielund. I wish the exotic ranged weaponry was better<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd thanks for the comments on the pictures! Honestly I only start looking for pictures for builds now when I start to feel a little happier about them<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the BAB I have kept it at 25 to make use of the divine power extra attack at full BAB which Maximillian Kane was a very strong advocate for. I have tested it in one of the character creation modules - PGCC - and the extra attack is still at full BAB (so it hasn't been patched out, and functions similar to an extra attack from Haste). I recall if the attack schedule included two extra attacks from divine power and haste, then the progression would look like 39 / 34 / 29 / 39 / 34. I know some cleric players I have read don't really bother with it, but from the power gamer perspective maybe it is stronger?\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the lack of level 7 to 9 spells early on I have been thinking about that when writing the builds and I am glad you have pointed that out it certainly reduces enjoyability a little knowing those spells could be accessed if the wisdom was higher at that stage of the game<br/>\n<br/>\nI can drop strength by 2, drop the cleric levels a little and delay devastating critical a little to accommodate the player being able to access level appropriate spells as soon they are potentially available\u00a0whilst retaining 'undispellability'.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it leads to a more enjoyable experience. Both builds will get armor skin.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Pestilent Heirarch is potentially even stronger, being able to include weapon specialisation and epic weapon specialisation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as I know Cleric / Fighter / Assassin is a fairly unique combination, and havent found anything to compare the build with.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleric / CoT / Rogue has been done before, here's a few I can find.\u00a0<br/>\n<blockquote><div>Battle Priest of Torm\u00a0cleric 24 / champion of Torm 14 / rogue 2\u00a0(human?)\u00a0by Kurgan13\u00a0<br/>\n- AB 35 Str 25 dev crit at level 36<br/>\n<br/>\nSpellslinging Battlepriest\u00a0cleric 26 / rogue 4 / champion of Torm 10\u00a0(human)\u00a0by Cinnabar Din<br/>\n- AB 30 -
