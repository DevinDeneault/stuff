For starters, I will need Hips since their is no shade race within the game. That's one level of shadowdancer at the minimum. This character is just for roleplay so it doesn't need to be min/maxed for pvp. I will be using him in single player only. I only care that he can repeatedly sneak attack from stealth and can hold his own in melee with a two bladed sword.<br/>\nI look forward to hearing your suggestions!<br/>\nThank you<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

This affects the level limit and how the build is designed. Original campaign you are probably getting to level 15-16. Hordes of the Underdark, level 28 max. Aielund about level 36-38 max. I will want to get you the 'good stuff' as soon as possible rather than waiting to later.\u00a0<br/>\n- Confirm racial preference (I presume Human is ok?)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there are any other features, like is he/she very persuasive, is he a good trader, does he/she have good lore, does he/she set and disable traps, open locks etc etc that would also assist me further but I can work without it too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso does your character have a name too? I am curious and would add a richness to any discussion<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

He was a human assassin that became a worshiper of shar and was offered the transformation into being a shade so that he could hunt down the church's enemies more efficiently.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was planning on playing him through multiple modules. I was going to begin in the original campaign, then through undrentide and hordes. I realize I will steam through undrentide given my character level at that point but I wanted to rack up some extra xp before hordes. I'm playing on console now so I dont have access to downloadable modules anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for skills he was rather intelligent so had plenty of points to spend. I'm willing to sacrifice in this area if need be though.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks\u00a0DarthRavadge<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what I came up with<br/>\nTwo-bladed sword wielding rogue with max stealth, max UMD/Tumble, max disable trap, and points in search, open lock, set trap etc etc<br/>\nWith 6 attacks per round (7 with haste), up to 9d6 sneak attack / hit, +6-12 damage / hit from strength (depending whether you can reach the Str cap) and +6 damage / hit from weapon specialization/epic weapon specialization, this guy will be a physical damage dealing beast.<br/>\nSneak attacks can be maximised through stealth, HiPS, improved knockdown or UMD to create summons to generate more flanking attacks<br/>\nOnce you get Crippling Strike your sneak attacks will destroy your opponent's strength score, stopping the from fighting effectively against you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis guy can also disable or even retrieve traps, then set them (up to deadly traps) against your opponents.<br/>\nI also maxed out persuasion, it is always nice to get maximal NPC rewards during the Bioware campaigns<br/>\n<br/>\nHis weakness are his saves, particularly the will save. This is probably going to be most likely way this character is going to die.\u00a0<br/>\nThere are many strategies to deal with this.\u00a0<br/>\nI would use items such as clarity potions, or protection against evil scrolls to protect his mind against such issues.<br/>\nAnother strategy is to 'dodge' targeted spells with hide in plain sight, but this will not be effective against area of effect spells.\u00a0<br/>\nAny items with mind immunity will be highly valuable. I believe there is an item called a Golden Circlet in the original campaign which may be of interest.<br/>\nItems can also be equipped to boost his will save, for example, amulets of will.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could have gone more along the Shade theme and put more points in shadowdancer (shadowdancer 4 gets shadow evade, which fits RP wise) but I opted to boost his will save and take more fighter levels for bonus feats, it is more powerful this way I believe.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe can wield his two-bladed sword effectively from level 2, before then he will be most effective with two short swords<br/>\nI also envisaged him wearing medium to light armor to assist with his stealth abilities (heavy armor incurs large penalties to stealth)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Improved Disarm feat is very nice for a two-bladed sword wielder, if you want this, then drop armor skin and ESF: Discipline and rearrange the ESF: Hide / ESF: Move Silently to bonus epic level (level 20+) rogue feats<br/>\n<br/>\nAB boosts are always valuable in dual wielding builds. Potions of Bull's Strength, Bless and Aid will be handy to keep in your inventory. Improved disarm can also situationally boost AB up to +8, if it is fit into the build, read the details on disarm in the NWN wiki if you want to learn more how this works<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me know what you think - if you need any other adjustments / tweaks let me know<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all it looks like a build where the numbers look fabulous if you can manage one weakness well.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Rogue(17), Fighter(10), Shadowdancer(1), Human\nSTR: 16 (22)\nCON: 14\nINT: 14\n\n01: Rogue(1): Ambidexterity, Two-Weapon Fighting\n03: Fighter(2): Dodge, Weapon Focus: Two-Bladed Sword\n05: Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}\n07: Rogue(4)\n09: Fighter(4): Knockdown, Weapon Specialization: Two-Bladed Sword\n11: Rogue(6)\n13: Fighter(5)\n15: Rogue(9): Improved Knockdown\n17: Rogue(11)\n19: Fighter(7)\n21: Fighter(8): Epic Weapon Focus: Two-Bladed Sword, Epic Weapon Specialization: Two-Bladed Sword\n23: Rogue(14)\n25: Rogue(15)\n27: Fighter(10): Armor Skin, Epic Prowess\n\nHitpoints: 266\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 15/11/19\nBAB: 20\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 21/30\nAlignment Changes: 0\nDisable Trap 31(35), Discipline 30(46), Hide 31(44), Move Silently 31(44), Open Lock 16(19), Persuade 31(30), Search 12(14), Set Trap 10(15), Spellcraft 3(5), Spot 19(18), Tumble 31(34), UMD 31(30)\n\n02: Discipline(5), Save(10),\u00a0\n04: Disable Trap(2), Hide(3), Move Silently(3), Open Lock(2), Persuade(3), Tumble(3), UMD(3),\u00a0\n06: Discipline(3), Save(2),\u00a0\n08: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Persuade(1), Tumble(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n10: Disable Trap(3), Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Open Lock(2), Persuade(2), Search(2), Tumble(2), UMD(3),\u00a0\n12: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Persuade(1), Set Trap(1), Spot(5), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n14: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Persuade(2), Tumble(2), UMD(2),\u00a0\n16: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(1), Persuade(1), Search(1), Spot(2), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n18: Discipline(5), Save(3),\u00a0\n20: Disable Trap(1), Hide(3), Move Silently(3), Persuade(3), Tumble(4), UMD(4),\u00a0\n22: Disable Trap(4), Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Persuade(2), Tumble(2), UMD(2),\u00a0\n24: Discipline(3), Save(2),\u00a0\n26: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Persuade(1), Search(3), Spot(2), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n28: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Persuade(2), Spot(1), Tumble(2), UMD(2),\u00a0\n</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That's \u00a0interesting. Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nOut of curiosity how viable is a wizard/cleric for going through the bioware campaigns? I was looking through my old character sheets last night and found a mystic theurge that was I always had a ton of fun with. My only concern would be making SR checks at higher levels. Wizard would be the primary focus to keep the caster level as high as possible with cleric just added in for buffing/healing. Any idea how to split those levels so Sr could still be overcome with GSP?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Cordor was nothing but characters with names like Phil mccracken, lol. The underdark didn't have that but the few people I did encounter there wouldn't even speak with me so that's when I decided to try another area. <br/>\nI'll give it another shot. I may have judged it too quickly.<br/>\nIt's definitely strange getting used to the additional mechanics like food and water. Not something I'm used to in nwn. I love all the additional character options though.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
