      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Was working on a dwarven warrior build to play in a party. \u00a0I was wanting a strength build with heavy armor (just because) and was debating between a F-WM-CoT build or a F-Bd-CoT build ... trying to optimize AB, AC and saves. \u00a0And then I recalled the attribute boosts from RDD. \u00a0The +8 STR was very enticing; and then I started looking at the boosts from the Bard's Song and Curse Song ... and could see a path forward. \u00a016 levels of bard seemed optimimum for the song; and 10 levels of RDD left 14 levels of fighter.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, it was off to the spreadsheet ... and then I was left with some hard choices (which really were not all that difficult for me, however, some may consider them strange or even unthinkable) ... I opted to ignor the bard spells ... yes, ignore them all together. \u00a016 levels devoted to bard, and can't cast a single spell. \u00a0:(<br/>\n<br/>\n For me, it wasn't that tough of a choice. \u00a0I wanted heavy armor (and shield) .. and bards being arcane casters suffer heavy penalties for attempting spells with heavy armor. \u00a0There is a solution, the Still Spell feat ... but it is another feat. \u00a0And then to \"do it right\" you'd likely need Combat Casting (another feat) \u00a0and of course skill points in Concentration would become nearly mandatory. \u00a0If all of that were not reason enough, bards only get six levels of spells (and at L16 only five levels are usable without 22 points in Charisma). \u00a0And then as a level 16 spell caster, most buffs (applied while not wearing armor) are going to be dispelled when up against the first casters ... and I really hate it when that happens. \u00a0On the other hand, the bard song is undispellable and can't be interupted .. (and affects everyone in the party) a pretty good deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n I tried to work in Lingering Song ... just really couldn't work it in early enough to be useful ... I suppose one could swap it out for Toughness at L39 ...\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n I didn't list a weapon, as I'd REALLY liked to have gotten Exotic and used a Dwarven Waraxe ... but to be honest with the Dev Crit line of feats, something like a scimitar would probably be better.<br/>\n<br/>\n There are several builds here with this class combination; but only one (that I noticed) sacrificed the spell casting as this one does; \u00a0Demos' \"Dreadnought Fighter\" (F24_Bd6_RDD10). <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/515496/Dreadnought-Fighter-24-Bard-6-Red-Dragon-Disciple-10#.WQX6Wvl96Cg\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/51 ... QX6Wvl96Cg</a><br/>\n<br/>\n The Dragon Singer makes better use of the bard song by taking it up to the \"sweet spot\" of L16. \u00a0This will allow 8 castings each of the song and curse song per rest cycle, providing +2 AB, +5 AC from the song and an effective +2 AC and +5 AB from the curse song for an effective total of +7 AB and +7 AC to the base stats listed below. \u00a0The Taunt skill can further boost effective AB by up to +6 by lowering the opponent's AC.<br/>\n<br/>\n Dragon Singer Fighter(14), Bard(16), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Dwarf<br/>\n PvM<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 16 (36)<br/>\n
