      "content": "<div><strong>Dark Warden (BG4, Ranger26, Fighter10)<br/>\nBy Tyr Templar</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Concept:</strong> The Dark Warden is a skilled trapper and hunter, with a love of the great outdoors, the fresh mountain air, the sound of water rushing down the stream, and a preference for hunting animals of the two-legged variety: man-kind. <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Pros and Cons:</strong><br/>\nWarden has a very good (high) AB (Naked 44+2 Bane: 46 / Buffed: AB 52, +3 Smite) and nothing short of exciting damage output [STR-based, Fighter WS/EWS along with Ranger buffs and BoE, BG Bull\u2019s (which stacks with Bull\u2019s potions) and Divine Might, with a bit of sneak damage, too\u2014lethal!]. Double-weapon focus as well\u2014namely, Scimitar (single wield/board, in full dress battle gear) and the Double-Axe (dual wield/large double-bladed weapon with a /x3 crit factor), with Divine Shield for propping up defense when dual-wielding such that, albeit offensive-based (the dead don't strike back, eh?), defense has not been overlooked (i.e. DS with Cat\u2019s fully covers off the difference between heavy and light armor, just add CHA and/or DEX for more, which CHA will further and in addition raise not only saves (Dark Blessing) but also damage (DM), with DS also providing a nice boost of course when/if in full plate/battle dress gear, too). <br/>\n<br/>\nSkills are decent, having everything a good\u2026er\u2026evil warden really needs, including deadly traps for added flavor and versatility (not to mention deadly). While Warden has a nice (good) fort, rest are decent, and has Dark Blessing (which Blessing and/or clarity potions you'll want to use and shore up that will save). <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Other Combos:</strong><br/>\nAs if all of that wasn\u2019t enough, turns out that not only is Warden the first to make use of the BG/Ranger/Fighter combo according to the Pulse/search engine, but also appears to be the first to bring Ranger dual-wield and BG Divine Might / Divine Shield together as well, meaning the double-bladed Warden is doubly unique (or is that triply so, as did I mention a double weapon specialization, too?     ). Without any further ado, please meet:<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><br/>\nDark Warden (BG4, Ranger26, Fighter10)</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>I Attributes</strong>:<br/>\nSTR: 16 (30)<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 12<br/>\nWIS: 14<br/>\nINT: 8<br/>\nCHA: 16<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman, Evil (theme: CE)<br/>\n<strong><br/>\nII Level Guide: </strong><br/>\n01: Ranger(1): weapon proficiency exotic, power attack, favored enemy I, {Dual Wield}<br/>\n02: Fighter(1): cleave<br/>\n03: Fighter(2): weapon focus: scimitar, weapon focus: double axe<br/>\n04: Fighter(3): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n05: Ranger(2)<br/>\n06: Ranger(3): knockdown<br/>\n07: Ranger(4)<br/>\n08: Ranger(5): STR+1, favored enemy II, (STR=18)<br/>\n09: Ranger(6): blind fight<br/>\n10: Blackguard(1)<br/>\n11: Blackguard(2): {Smite Good}<br/>\n12: Fighter(4): STR+1, weapon specialization: scimitar, weapon specialization: double axe, (STR=19)<br/>\n13: Ranger(7)<br/>\n14: Ranger(8)<br/>\n15: Blackguard(3): divine shield<br/>\n16: Ranger(9): STR+1, {Improved Two-Weapon Fighting}, (STR=20)<br/>\n17: Ranger(10): favored enemy III<br/>\n18: Blackguard(4): divine might<br/>\n19: Ranger(11)<br/>\n20: Fighter(5): STR+1, (STR=21)<br/>\n21: Fighter(6): epic weapon focus: scimitar, epic weapon focus: double axe<br/>\n22: Fighter(7)<br/>\n23: Ranger(12)<br/>\n24: Fighter(8): STR+1, epic weapon specialization: scimitar, epic weapon specialization: double axe, (STR=22)<br/>\n25: Ranger(13)<br/>\n26: Ranger(14)<br/>\n27: Ranger(15): great strength I, favored enemy IV, (STR=23)<br/>\n28: Ranger(16): STR+1, (STR=24)<br/>\n29: Ranger(17)<br/>\n30: Ranger(18): epic prowess<br/>\n31: Ranger(19)<br/>\n32: Ranger(20): STR+1, favored enemy V, (STR=25)<br/>\n33: Ranger(21): great strength II, (STR=26)<br/>\n34: Ranger(22)<br/>\n35: Ranger(23): bane of enemies<br/>\n36: Fighter(9): STR+1, great strength III, (STR=28)<br/>\n37: Fighter(10): armor skin<br/>\n38: Ranger(24)<br/>\n39: Ranger(25): great strength IV, favored enemy VI, (STR=29)<br/>\n40: Ranger(26): STR+1, favored enemy VII, (STR=30)<br/>\n<br/>\n*Weapon Note: Scimitar taken for its crit. Factor (also enabling board (and plate, too) thus, AC), with double-axe (large, double-bladed) chosen as it not only looks right (BG\u2019s wield big axes, one blade being nice, but double blade always better) but also because it works with Blade Thirst (requires slashing weapon) and has a /x3 crit. factor (nice for taking down the \u201cbig boss\u201d, etc., and with 6 apr (7 apr hasted), with all the damage of course chews through enemies like there's no tomorrow, too). Another double-bladed weapon to consider is the Two-Bladed Sword, also large, double-bladed slashing weapon with a better crit. range (17-20/x2; Keen: 15-20) than has the double-axe, but only a /x2 multiplier in which case might consider swapping out the scimmy for bastard sword instead. Otherwise, apart from Blade Thirst requirements (slashing weapon), weapons are a matter of personal choice, most true.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n<strong><br/>\nIII. Basics:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\na.
