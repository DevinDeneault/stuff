The only thing I don't like about this guy is that he strengthens the Evil side. High AB, high damage, UMD, Taunt/Expertise combo, a true MONSTER!<br/>\n<br/>\n Now seriously I do have a tweak to suggest for those who play in worlds where you can count on some items to cap charisma. I would drop Improved Critical all day long for Divine Shield. You get 10% chance of dealing double damage IF YOU AREN'T FIGHTING UNDEADS OR PMs. With Divine Shield, it gives you options to raise your AC and even tank a little, although it's not your forte. <br/>\n<br/>\n Inversely, you could drop Divine Might if you have no way to boost CHA for Improved KD. <br/>\n<br/>\n Overal, really good build! :D<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

This one is a VERY GOOD BG build. U can't go wrong with it! And yes, you can go DevCrit. You would need to drop Divine Might for Great Cleave and two Great Strengths for Overwhelming and Devastating Critical, but it's doable. You can also drop KD, but I would advise against that and even more against dropping Expertise due to the Taunt / Expertise combo.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

And yes you could incorporate Dev. Crit. into this one as well if you do as Max said, what feat you drop pre-epic is your choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n What is forgotten perhaps, is that all three of us we have made other BG builds as well, My Antipaladin and MAx's Valen are two other choices you have but.. Would you like a real brute? I am not talking finesse here, i am talking something similar like we did in the pure builds with Theophilus and the Puissant Paladin now. I am talking about strength that can uproot trees and crash the necks of bullocks here. If yes, is the answer then try this one (also by Mick)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Champion Of Gruumsh</strong> -&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2351878/Champion-of-Gruumsh-Barbarian-10-Rogue-2-Blackguard-28#.VMlfGS5S38M\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/23 ... MlfGS5S38M</a><br/>\n<br/>\n And this is how you modify it for getting also Dev. Crit. still with max strength.<br/>\n<br/>\n a) Replace \"toughness\" with \"great cleave\"<br/>\n b) Replace the two \"improved sneak attack\" feats with \"overwhelming\" and \"devastating critical\"<br/>\n c) Change weapon to greatsword/ scimitar and shield<br/>\n<br/>\n Have fun!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I think it's worth considering, but it would depend on how effective the toon would be without it where you play and how much more effective he would be with it. Honestly, here Mick goes for 40 STR, which is good for Devcrit DC. I would think it'd be nice to have, to say the least. A lot of servers have banned Devcrit and besides that a lot of players think it can be a little boring or \"overpowered\" so they don't take it, but if you are in neither situation, go for it! I would say it's a personal choice.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I know it's a SHIT summon, but what it does for you is allow you to flank and get some Sneak Attacks in. Flanking, you gain a +2 situational AB, which is desirable, maybe you should consider Stoneskinning your summon so it lasts longer. You can craft a Stoneskin wand, you know?
