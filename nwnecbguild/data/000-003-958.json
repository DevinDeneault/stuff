      "content": "<div>So that would mean taking Extend Spell instead of Still - still meaning having to bin Blind Fighting or Knockdown - assuming taking Lingering Song, Finesse, WF, Extend Spell and Curse Song. That would leave one feat - unless you went human (in which case you'd need martial or exotic prof, or restricting your weapon choice quite fiercely) or popped in some Fighter (with its xp issues in an elf build and loss of Bard 16). So it's a question of whether the dex and proficiency benefits from going elf outweigh the loss of of KD or Blind Fighting (and the skills points)?<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless, and this is perfectly possible, I've got it wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

      "content": "<div>A level 16 song is a fine thing. But it requires a modified perform rank of 30. A level 16 build can \"only\" take 19 ranks. You get a +2-3 bonus from charisma 14-15-16. The skill focus feat adds +3 and the artist feat adds +2. So no matter what, you depend on items with skill bonus perform to get a level 16 song.<br/>\nA level 15 song only needs a perform rank of 24, and a level 14 song perform 21.<br/>\nBoth bard 14 and bard 15 have access to level 5 spells and can extend or still level 4 spells. Bard 16 has access to level 6 spells, but gets no slots for them unless you have a very high charisma or get items with level 6 bonus slots.<br/>\nWhat I say is that you may want to multiclass with 1 or 2 levels of another class. <br/>\nFighter is a good alternative for a strength build. <br/>\nFor a dexterity build I would look at 2 levels of shadowdancer, assassin or barbarian for uncanny dodge.</div>",
