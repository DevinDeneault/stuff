Dual Kama Improved Two Weapon Fighting and BAB 26+ for 10 APR with flurry and haste.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAssassin for Death Attack, UMD, undispellable Improved Invisibility and Great Dexterities as bonus feats to achieve a maximum capped Dexterity of 50 if desired.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlackguard to achieve the BAB 26+ add some sneak attack damage, and a Vrock to tank for you. Undispellable stackable bull's strength and whole bunch of proficiencies you don't need but are handy, and one epic bonus feat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis guy has Base AB 45 hitting Mithdradates's mystical target of 'AB 45 = good warrior'.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe's also got Taunt for -6 AC to opponents for an effective AB of 51.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nEvasion and Deflect Arrows with a base reflex save of 36.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nUncanny dodge to protect the Dex AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd funnily enough, it is a MAD build (Multiple Attribute Dependent).<br/>\n<br/>\nNaked AC with Dex and Wis capped +5 robes AC +5 deflection +5 natural +5 dodge is 64<br/>\n<br/>\nWith both Charisma and Dexterity capped no other items, reflex save is 48 :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I've called him the Elven Deathguard but other names might be the Elven 'Deathpecker' (if Valerfor is reading) or Elven 'Death Mantis' (If Grizzled_Dwarflord is reading)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's probably good on Blackstone Keep with the bonus acid damage with the Assassin Class.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll have to say this is one for <em class=\"mention\">@Cornflower</em>\u00a0to read :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is a situation where Assassin is better than Rogue? And Elf is better than Human or Dwarf (for a non-AA build)?\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSurely the moment has come?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway what do you guys think? Think I should drop Int a little and pump Cons up? Haven't many proper assassins, not sure what that would do to the death attack...<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm a bit concerned how this guy deals with sneak immune dwarven defenders, pale masters or constructs with high damage resistance...<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Monk(6), Blackguard(13), Assassin(21), Elf\nSTR: 10\nCON: 10\nINT: 14\n\n01: Monk(1): Weapon Focus (Kama), {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}\n03: Monk(3): Weapon Finesse\n05: Monk(5)\n07: Assassin(1)\n09: Assassin(3): Two Weapon Fighting\n11: Blackguard(2): {Smite Good}\n13: Blackguard(4)\n15: Blackguard(6): Improved Two Weapon Fighting\n17: Assassin(4)\n19: Blackguard(9)\n21: Assassin(5): Epic Weapon Focus (Kama)\n23: Assassin(7)\n25: Assassin(9)\n27: Assassin(10): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=28)\n29: Assassin(12)\n31: Assassin(14): Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=31)\n33: Assassin(15): Great Dexterity V, (DEX=33)\n35: Assassin(17)\n37: Assassin(19)\n39: Assassin(21): Great Dexterity VIII, (DEX=37)\n\nSkillpoints: 232\nSaving Throw bonuses: Mind Effects: +4, Traps: +2, Poison: +10\nAB (max, naked): 45 (melee), 42 (ranged)\nSpell Casting:\u00a0\n\n\n01: Concentration(4), Hide(4), Move Silently(4), Save(12),\u00a0\n03: Concentration(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(13),\u00a0\n05: Concentration(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(19),\u00a0\n07: Disable Trap(1), Listen(1), Open Lock(1), Search(8), Set Trap(1), Tumble(5), UMD(10), Save(3),\u00a0\n09: Save(15),\u00a0\n11: Concentration(1), Taunt(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n13: Concentration(1), Taunt(1), Save(8),\u00a0\n15: Concentration(1), Taunt(1), Save(12),\u00a0\n17: Tumble(10), UMD(10),\u00a0\n19: Concentration(1), Taunt(1), Save(2),\u00a0\n21: Listen(6), UMD(4),\u00a0\n23: Listen(5), UMD(1),\u00a0\n25: UMD(1), Save(9),\u00a0\n27: Tumble(5), UMD(2),\u00a0\n29: Listen(5), UMD(1),\u00a0\n31: Save(8),\u00a0\n33: Listen(1), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n35: Listen(5), Save(1),\u00a0\n37: Listen(1), Tumble(5), Save(2),\u00a0\n39: Listen(1), Save(12),\u00a0</details></div>"

      "content": "<div>Death attack DC depends on the number of assassin levels and the intelligence modifier. With 21 assassin levels the DC is a bit low if you want to paralyze creatures with fortitude as high save. Taking away intelligence will also lower the DC and give less skill points.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are talking about Death attack damage, then it depends solely on assassin levels, in the same way as the Sneak attack of the rogue.<br/>\nAgainst true seers that you cannot stalk, you can still land Death attack damage either by using Knockdown and hit them while they are down, or by rushing them (around corners and/or by using high speed) so you land attacks before they have time to react (trigger the on perception script).<br/>\n<br/>\nAgainst crit and sneak immunes, you want to use weapons with a high damage bonus, capping strength and buffing your weapons with flame weapon etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nRogue is often better than assassin and for several reasons so. But assassin is better than rogue when you want Great dexterity as a bonus feat, when you want to avoid an xp penalty and if you want to paralyze your opponents. The Improved invisibility from the assassin class feat is far better than the vanilla spell you can use with UMD.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf elf is better than human or dwarf? In a dexterity build it usually is. In a scout build where you can benefit from the keen senses, it is definitely better. \u00a0<br/>\nHalfling is often an even better race for dex builds, but not if you want to dual wield Kamas.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep the ideas flowing!\u00a0<span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83d\ude42</span></div>",

      "content": "<div>Really appreciate your awesome comments Mick!<br/>\n<br/>\nI am very fortunate with your knowledge of both dex builds and rogues/assassins.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've written two more drafts to try to mitigate the damage concerns against sneak immunes. They use the fighter class to access WS/EWS.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso pumped assassin sky high to access as many great dexterities as I can!<br/>\n<br/>\nOne has AB 46 (BAB 28) but unfortunately goes fighter 13 / Assassin 7 pre-epic (losing a bit of its character early on) and also has a 20% exp penalty from level 22 onwards and one has to cross class hide and move silently to access assassin. With Flurry and Dual Kama the Base AB is 42.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other has a base AB of 44 (BAB 26) and only has a 20% exp penalty at a single level, level 20. I like this one better, I'm pretty proud of dodging the exp penalty for 39 out of 40 levels for sure. With Flurry and Dual Kama the Base AB is 40. I wish that was higher.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I'm curious what you guys think!
