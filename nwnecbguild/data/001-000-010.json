      "content": "<div>Hey Hi all. I was thinking of getting NWN on XBox One. But I was wondering if would be able to play the PW's, and the DLC Mods, and the Vault/User created Mods like Aielund, etc, on the XBox One version of NWN.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anyone done that, this?? Or even if not, does anyone know if that is possible to do on the XBox One version of NWN??<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso has anybody played NWN on either XBox One or P4??? And if so, what was it like???<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<br/>\n<br/>\nMike</div>"

      "content": "<div>That's a good question, it might be worth asking on the Beamdog forums. I know I've seen people playing on the Switch on hakless PWs, but never seen it mentioned elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaven't you been playing WoG on Android? If so it might be similar, but don't take my word for it. Definitely try and connect with Beamdog support.</div>"
