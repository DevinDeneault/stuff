      "content": "<div>Just started playing again after a long time away and found out how much I missed this game.  I've started on Amia and it seems its a fairly magical world but with a top level restriction of 30.  I tend to play my clerics like fighters more then healbots which I find boring.  I have read a few builds in here but just  can't get into the whole monk/cleric I prefer to play more fighter/cleric with a hammer or even a bastard sword something with a shield for the ac.  I know its not the optimal build it would seem but its what I like.  I have been leaning towards Tempus for the Deity so at least the strength domain for the divine powers the other domain I'm flexible on.  I would appreciate any help from those willing as I find myself rather rusty on game mechanics as it is.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Yes, that definitely changes it - pull the 4th level of fighter into pre-epic.  Doesn't matter where as long as you take Weapon Spec with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmpyre's suggestions for Cleave (replaces the saving throw feats in my build) on lvl 1 is a good one if it's slow leveling - that extra attack early on after killing a monster is really effective  early game. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnless a lot of early mobs have HIS or use darkness/blind, I'd take Knockdown before Blind Fight every time.  I'd also take improved crit before toughness as well - the extra crit on a warhammer is worth a lot more to me at lvl 11 than 11 HP.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also generally find that other feats like expertise, improved crit, etc are more effective earlier than Extend Spell (bc it's really only extending your rd/lvl  buff a few rounds) and that Cleric level 9 really starts to make Extend Spell effective enough to be worth the feat.</div>"
