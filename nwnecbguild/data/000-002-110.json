I hope others find it as illuminating as I did.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: per Stagmeister 15/09/20 to contextualize the discussion.</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHail all! This is a very interesting discussion!<br/>\n<br/>\nThose who have extensive experience playing speed casters - could you shed some light on the stacking of Expeditious Retreat? The Wiki says that the spell stacks with itself. As such - can a double casting of it be similar to Mass Haste + Exp retreat? Would that maybe solve Hips dilemma of sacrificing illusion focus even? :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if Expeditious Retreat stacks, will Haste cancel its effect if applied to increase number of casts per round?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance!</div>"

I'm still not cometely clear, and the Wiki doesn't specify - would having the Monk Speed feat + casting ExpRet 2x times + casting Haste have the same effect as Monk Speed + ExpRet+Mass Haste?

Well, it seems its back to the library for the spell nerds :( <br/>\n<br/>\nI've always considered the Monk class to be OP - with a major in all 3 saves, extreme spell resistance and immunity to shitloads of other stuff, Monk AC from Wis, usually sky-high Dex and, cosequently, ED - they basically have NO weaknesses.

It's a really interesting question, and something worth testing, because, while the ExpRet description in the Wiki says that \"the spell has no effect if the character is already hasted\", the Haste spell description does not have the corresponding note for ExpRet.

The test scene was the arena in the Pretty Good Character creator and optimizer Module (the test arena, where you can summon any enemy to fight). I ran from one end of the arena to the other. <br/>\n<br/>\nNo speed increase of any kind - 10sec<br/>\nWith only haste - 6.3 sec<br/>\n2x ER - 4.19 sec<br/>\nER+Mass Haste - 4.19 sec<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to the interesting part:<br/>\n2x ER + Haste - 4.9 sec (in short, consistently slower than 2x ER or ER + Mass Haste but still faster than only Haste).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to the VERY interesting part:<br/>\n2x ER + Mass Haste - 3.7 sec!<br/>\n3xER + Haste - 3.7 sec!<br/>\n<br/>\nFurther castings of ER do not improve the speed - seemingly this is the cap.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you first cast Haste and then 2x ER - nothing happens, your speed remains at Haste level.<br/>\nSame for Mass Haste if you cast it before ER.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnalysing the times relative to each other, we can observe the following:<br/>\n1) the Monk speed bonus is added only ONCE after the first speed increase, not multiple times:<br/>\n- normal time - 10 sec (speed = 1.1)<br/>\n - 2xER or ER+Mass Haste time - 4.19 (speed = 10*1.1/4.19 = 2.625 = (1,1*1.5+0.1)*1.5 - the second addition doesn't happen).<br/>\nBelow you will see that this is the correct formula, because the results will be consistent in other examples. It is also evident, that Mass Haste is a multiplicative bonus (contrary to Haste, as we will see below).<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Haste turns into an additive bonus if applied simultaneously with ER:<br/>\n2xER+Haste time is 4.9sec - speed 10*1.1/4.9 = 2.25 = (1.1*1.5+0.1)+0.5.<br/>\nI also ran another test to try and prove that this is so - and here's the eye opener: if you cast Haste after first casting ER you actually run SLOWER than when you cast Haste alone! Haste is 6.3 sec, whereas ER+Haste is 6.6 sec. Doing the math:<br/>\n - Haste speed = 10*1.1/6.3 = 1.75 = 1.1*1.5+0.1 (here, Haste is multiplicative)<br/>\n - ER + Haste speed = 10*1.1/6.6 = 1.67 = (1.1*1.5+0.1)/1.5+0.5 (it seems, that if Haste is applied as a secondary effect - its additive, not multiplicative)<br/>\nMaybe its a bug, but I really see no other explanation for the numbers, and I'm certain of the stop-watch timing because I ran each number like a dozen times, and the results were consistent.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) To reach the speed cap in fact requires 3xER + Haste or 2x ER + Mass Haste. The resulting speed is 3.0 (10*1.1/3.7 = 3.0), because of the 3.0 cap. In fact, the 2xER+Mass Haste speed  is greater than 3xER + Haste speed, but they are both over the cap, so this becomes irrelevant:<br/>\n - 2xER + Mass Haste: (1.1*1.5+0.1)*1.5*1.5 = 3.93<br/>\n - 3xER + Haste: (1.1*1.5+0.1)*1.5+0.5=3.125<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to sum up:<br/>\n1) 2xER + Haste is not the same as ER + Mass Haste, seemingly because, while ER is a multiplicative bonus, Haste is an additive bonus when applied as a secondary effect.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) BUT, considering the speed cap, a wizard need not know the Mass Haste spell in order to reach it! It seems, HipMaestro can still specialize in illusion and run at break-neck speeds - which is huge :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one is willing to sacrifice 2 additional lvl 1 spell slots for an extra ER (or lvl 2 slots if you use the extended version) - you can forego the Mass Haste spell and specialize in illusion, giving yourself 1 additional spell slot per spell lvl! In my book - that's really worth it!<br/>\n<br/>\nYour thoughts and comments on this will be much appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>"

Thank you for that!<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestion: even though my test methodology is seriously less accurate than yours, I am still quite certain, that ER+Haste (spell) is a lower speed than only Haste (spell). I am certsin of this both because the timing differs quite substantially and consistently (so measurement error is not the case), and because the difference is visible on-screen (you can actually see the character moving slower).<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I was not able to determine the reason for this effect, because have no idea what scrypt is used to \"remove one instance of ER\". Is it possible to test this in your module? <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<br/>\n<br/>\n\u041e\u0442\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e \u0441 \u043c\u043e\u0435\u0433\u043e SM-G970F \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437 Tapatalk<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>"
