When you take first level in a new class, then you will have to take 2 more levels in the same class afterwards. Therefore it is not possible to have:<br/>\nWizard 29 / Rogue 1 (3-levels-in-class rule must be fulfilled even on level 30)<br/>\nCleric 2 / Rogue 1 (you need to have 3 levels in each class before taking a new class or continuing to progress in different class)<br/>\nThis means one you have taken the required 3 in a row, you can go in any order because you did the FIRST three in order<br/>\n<br/>\nFeats Devastating Critical and Summon Mount are disallowed on Arelith. Some other changes can be found in <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Console_commands\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Console commands</a>.

Their Shadow Evade now lasts 3 rounds per class level (much longer than the standard 5 rounds). A +1 bonus to Hide is given with each SD level taken. <br/>\n<br/>\nArcane Archer -  Ranger levels will count toward the arcane casting requirement(meaning the base 3 lvls of ranger will do it, you don't have to go until you get spells)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh ya! Shifter and RDD are almost impossible as they are only allowed IF you sacrifice an epic lvl character then make a 5% roll and only then can you have a shifter or RDD prestige levels.(this apparently is going to change soon but hasn't yet)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">A few specific server details that may affect builds:<br/>\n<br/>\n- No stacking weapon-buff spells (GMW / Darkfire / etc replace the last-used one) with the exception of Bless Weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Spell Focus: Abjuration gives +2 to dispel checks, to a max of +6 with Epic Spell Focus: Abjuration. So being level 24 only makes you un-dispellable from non-abjuration characters; it should be enough to make you undispellable from creatures.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: From the wiki\n<blockquote><div>    Mordkainen's disjunction is capped at 20. (To remove an effect, the caster makes a dispel check of 1d20, +1 per caster level (to a maximum of +20) against a DC of 11 + the spell effect's caster level.) <br/>\n<br/>\n    \"A lv30 Caster has DC41, a Lv20+ ESF Abjuration caster using Disjunction has +26, so they need a 15+ on their roll to dispel each one.\" Calassus </div></blockquote>\n\n- With the above, all casters can take Spell Focus feats<br/>\n<br/>\n- Arcane Defense: Abjuration gives +2 to dispel resistance<br/>\n<br/>\n- Barbarians have a unique interaction with alcohol; getting drunk will give you huge buffs to strength at the cost of dexterity. According to the Arelith Wiki:<br/>\n<blockquote><div>\n    When sufficiently drunk (below 0% sobriety) the Barbarian gains a boost to his strength. <br/>\n<br/>\n1. At first you get a +8 STR bonus and a moderate DEX penalty (5-6 ish?). Upon a second tick, it goes to a +12 STR bonus and a large DEX penalty (-8-10 ish). How bad the DEX penalty is scales with how drunk you are.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. This DOES count towards the +12 Stat modifier. Meaning while your completely drunk, you won't gain any STR benefits from items, barbarian rage, potions, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther bits of info... -Depending on how drunk you are, you'll also laugh, fall over, or otherwise flatfoot yourself in the middle of combat. It gets worse/more frequent as you get drunker, but it still happens VERY often even when mildly drunk.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Once you get into positive sobriety (ex: 0.06) you get another 6 minutes of being STR-boosted without a dex penalty.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Sitting will stop you from spamming the laugh/drunk emotes your forcing on everyone around you when drunk. \n</div></blockquote><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

What's to Come<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Server Introduction<br/>\nArelith Fixed Level Server has been designed as a new role-playing adventure concept, a dangerous world where all characters have scale. Where even an inexperienced cutthroat can pose a threat. A world with risks that influences group role-play towards dangerous adventures, for either exploration or hidden discoveries, with rare and unique treasures to be found. Where the role-play of a guild, a settlement's diplomacy and a characters reputation would develop power rather than an epic characters build.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal is trying to achieve a world which removes system segregation from all the players. This allows every single player to be able to explore together, role-play together, to take part in events, and to engage players in story lines and have comparable ability to everyone else from the very beginning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe server's fixed level has been set towards the end of the heroic tier (level 1-10) as level 9, This means that characters cannot progress further than level 9 using the NwN leveling system, however FL has its own unique progression system which has recently been introduced since August 12, see below for more details on system changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe level limit is designed to keep all players reasonably balanced within the same scale, so that they can all each individually pose a threat. The dangers of the environment can then also be catered towards that set scale offering you a more intense and challenging experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis guide has been developed for you to gain a detailed insight to what the server is about and what features it currently offers. This will be a live guide and will be updated accordingly with the server. All players should find this guide useful as a reference for character creation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Beta Stages<br/>\nArelith's Fixed Level Server is still currently in beta stages. It may experience drastic changes at any time with little to no notice. However, the focus throughout will be on creating a dynamic, RP intensive environment to adventure in.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe under no illusion as it is far from the finished product, which is why we need your help to test the server and give us constructive feed back in the forums. This is your chance to be a part of Arelith history as feedback is essential for any future progression.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n3. System Changes and Updates<br/>\nAugust 12 - Character Progression System implemented.<br/>\nAugust 12 - Paths and Gifts implemented.<br/>\nAugust 12 - System Database updated.<br/>\nAugust 12 - New Dungeon area implemented.<br/>\nAugust 12 - Skill values modified.<br/>\nAugust 12 - Trap and Chest Script implemented.<br/>\nAugust 12 - Minor Spawn changes and additions.<br/>\nSep 12 - Epic Feats implemented.<br/>\nSep 12 - Crafting Points implemented.<br/>\nSep 12 - Spell damage increased.<br/>\nSep 12 - Item creation costs modified.<br/>\nSep 12 - Warlock progression implemented.<br/>\nSep 12 - New items added to database.<br/>\nSep 12 - Fixed known training system bugs.<br/>\nSep 12 - System updated. (New fixtures and Poisons added.)<br/>\nSep 12 - Training System Updated.<br/>\nOct 12 - Server Shops Updated.<br/>\nOct 12 - Training System Updated.<br/>\nOct 12 - Crafting Points Updated.<br/>\nNov 12 - PRC Restrictions Applied.<br/>\nNov 12 - Bard progression implemented.<br/>\nNov 12 - Training System Updated.<br/>\nNov 12 - AA progression implemented.<br/>\nNov 12 - FL Death System implemented.<br/>\nNov 12 - Campaign Setting Updated.<br/>\nNov 12 - New Crafting System implemented.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Campaign Setting<br/>\nThe campaign setting is set back on Arelith in past, when the land was cruel and savage, a hundred or so years before the original server. Fort Cordor has recently been established by the Cordor Family and is calling out for soldiers and adventurers to aid in the establishment of Arelith.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe civilized elves of Arelith are have been established in the sanctuary of Minmir valley, many years before the arrival of the chaotic human expansion, they are distant and elusive. Minir serves as an outpost off the western shore of Faerun. The outpost serves as a staging ground for travellers to and from Evermeet.<br/>\n<br/>\nArelith [FL] supports its own unique Underdark 'Udith Che' which is currently in the state of civil war as the noble houses battle for control. Almost all the nobles are drow, but not all. The city once used to be wholly Llothite but the temple of Ghaunaduar has established itself through conflict which has caused anarchy. But not all battles are won with the sword.<br/>\n<br/>\nArelith [FL] also caters the island of Siabyad a dangerous lawless desert island, players can travel to from the bitter coast by boat. Live in Sibayad and you'll learn to love or hate the desert, a very dangerous land to be sure, the dry heat will kill you if you don't have water but so will the creatures living there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n5. FL Death System<br/>\nAll characters start with mandatory MoD. You get 10 PvP lives which means you can die as many times as you want PvE, but every PvP death you will loose a life. Death is serious on FL and characters will think twice before getting cut down by opponents blades, a very real danger that everyone dies eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Character Build System<br/>\nAll characters in the server start at level 9, and characters no longer need to take a minimum of 3 levels in each class as it offers more character customization due to the level 9 limit.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou no longer need to PRC tokens to take prestige classes, and the requirements of the prestige classes have been changed to allow full capabilities due to the level 9 limit.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are to be reminded that this is a role-playing server, and you may need to justify a characters RP reasons and backgrounds as to why you believe they should be their chosen prestige build. If any players are caught abusing the prestige class system without an adequate role-playing reason you may be subject to DM authority.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere has been a slight adjustment to the standard PRC requirements to allow a flexible character build system due to the level 9 limit, the new requirements are listed below;<br/>\n<br/>\nArcane Archer: Elf/Half-Elf, BAB 3, Weapon Focus: Bow.<br/>\nAssassin: Hide 8, Move Silently 8, Evil.<br/>\nBlackguard: BAB 3, Evil.<br/>\nChampion of Torm: BAB 3, Non-Evil.<br/>\nRed Dragon Disciple: Sorcerer/Bard, Lore 8.<br/>\nDwarven Defender: Dwarf, BAB 3, Lawful.<br/>\nHarper Scout: Lore 4, Discipline 4, Non-Evil.<br/>\nPale Master: Spellcaster Level 3, Non-Good.<br/>\nShadowdancer: Hide 8, Move Silently 8, Tumble 5.<br/>\nShifter: Druid Level 3 Spells.<br/>\nWeapon Master: BAB 3, Dodge, Expertise, Weapon Focus.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Character Progression System<br/>\nAll characters can now pay for 'training' with gold from the 'training npc' which will give you a selection of feats to pick from. Once you have selected the feat you wish, your system level will increase, after that every feat you buy it will cost more. This system also takes into account your ECL from any selected gifts.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce your system level (SL) reaches 31 (epic standard) you will then be able to purchase epic feats, with the cost continuing to scale with your level. There is no limit to how many available feats you can buy and learn. Once you have purchased a feat from the 'training npc' you will also be granted an additional 1 crafting points. You can calculate your SL by reducing any ECL from Gifts taken at character creation from your total ECL, which is displayed when you speak to the NPC trainer.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeats that have been designed to stack can generally only be taken up to a maximum of four times. All feats still require their standard prerequisites except for the following adjustments;<br/>\n<br/>\nImproved Critical: AB 5.<br/>\nImproved Knockdown: AB 5.<br/>\nImproved Two-Weapon Fighting: AB 5.<br/>\nStunning Fist: AB 5.<br/>\nEvasion: All classes.<br/>\nUncanny Dodge I-VI: All classes.<br/>\nUncanny Reflex: Uncanny Dodge VI.<br/>\nImproved Evasion 18 Dexterity.<br/>\nArcane Defense Spellcraft Rank.<br/>\nRogue Feats: Rogue Level/SL 10.<br/>\nGain Skill Points: Any-Class.<br/>\nSpell Focus: Any-Class.<br/>\nWarlock Progression Feat: Warlock Level.<br/>\nBard Song Progression Feat: Bard Level.<br/>\nFavored Enemy: Ranger Level/Harper Scout Level.<br/>\nCreature Weapon Focus: Druid/Shifter Levels.<br/>\nWeapon Specialization: Fighter Level.<br/>\nBarbarian Rage IV-VII: Barbarian Level/SL 11/14/15/19.<br/>\nBarbarian DR I- IV: Barbarian Level/SL 10/13/16/19.<br/>\nWild Shape II-IV: Druid Level 5.<br/>\nElemental Shape I-III: Wild Shape IV, Druid Level/SL 15/16/18.<br/>\nDiamond Body: Monk Level/SL 10.<br/>\nDiamond Soul: Monk Level/SL 11.<br/>\nQuivering Palm: Monk Level/SL 14.<br/>\nPerfect Self: Monk Level/SL 19.<br/>\nQuicken Spell: Spell Circle 3.<br/>\nEpic Feats: SL 31.<br/>\nEpic Skill Focus: Skill Focus, SL 31.<br/>\nThundering Rage: 21 Strength, SL 31.<br/>\nOverwhelming Critical: 18 Strength, SL 31.<br/>\nPerfect Health: 20 Constitution, SL 31.<br/>\nGreater Smiting: 20 Charisma, SL 31.<br/>\nImproved Stunning Fist: 17 Strength, 17 Wisdom, SL 31.<br/>\nTerrifying Rage: Epic Skill Focus (Intimidate), SL 31.<br/>\nAutomatic Metamagic: Epic Skill Focus (Spellcraft), SL 31.<br/>\nSelf Concealment: 22 Dexterity, Epic Skill Focus (Hide), SL 31.<br/>\nLasting Inspiration: Epic Skill Focus (Perform), SL 31.<br/>\nEpic Fiendish Servant: Blackguard Level/SL 31.<br/>\nEpic Dodge: 23 Dexterity, Improved Evasion, Dodge, SL 31.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers are advised that this progression system has just been released and may still be missing feats, if you match the prerequisites and you cannot find the feat you desire, or the feat that you purchased does not work correctly, then you are to post feedback on the forum so this matter can be adjusted for all players.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Unconfirmed Feats or still in progress);<br/>\n<br/>\nBlinding Speed: ?<br/>\nPlanar Turning: ?<br/>\nImproved Combat Casting: ?<br/>\nImproved Whirlwind Attack: ?<br/>\nImproved Ki Strike 4: ?<br/>\nImproved Sneak Attack: ?<br/>\nMighty Rage: ?<br/>\nEpic Shadow Lord: ?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n8. Character Treasure and Loot System<br/>\nIn the Fixed Level Server we have implemented a new generous loot matrix with no level restrictions. Which means your level 9 character could wield the sword of a thousand truths if he desired, or just a simple damask blade.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea is that the system will implement rare unique items and equipment which wouldn't normally be available on the original server. This system brings a lot of potential to character development and progression.<br/>\n<br/>\nAllowing rare and unique discoveries to be made bringing another level of lore to the world. Trinkets to keep in your back pocket for emergencies, scrolls and tomes of magic which would normally be unavailable due to level restrictions and rare equipment with bonus feats and magical powers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trap and chest system has recently been adjusted and has had a new script added that randomly targets 25% of chests to be unlocked and a further 25% of chests will no longer require traps. Characters that do not have pick lock or disarm trap skills can now access an approximate 25% of chests without traps and locks. Equipment plays an important part of the progression system, it would be unfair to allow all 'scout' builds acquire all the rare and profitable equipment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n9. Character Skill System<br/>\nIn the Fixed Level Server the use of skills points have been adjusted and increased, to promote the use of full build 'scout' classes such as rogues, assassins, and bards as they will now have a larger role to play beside 'warriors' and 'mages'.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersuade: Offers more gold which could increase the character development process.<br/>\nAppraise: Offers more gold which could increase the character development process.<br/>\nPick Pocket: Allows you to gain loot without having to fight, aids in character development.<br/>\nLock Pick: Chest DC's have been increased so that heavy rogue builds are essential for tough chests.<br/>\nSet Trap: Traps are stronger and useful due to the level limitations of the server.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n10. FL Crafting System<br/>\nCrafting skills<br/>\nOn FL, the crafting system has 5 skills.<br/>\n- Cooking - used for potions, kits and food. Potions will get a rework to make them actually worth crafting.<br/>\n- Forging - used for metal arms and armor (plus the odd fixture).<br/>\n- Tailoring - used for leather/cloth/hide armor, slings, belts/boots/cloaks etc<br/>\n- Handicrafting - used for anything made of wood or stone. Gems, longbows, staves etc.<br/>\n- Alchemy - used for rings and amulets, plus essence crafting.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour crafting skill is used both for making items of the types listed, and for improving them. An expert smith will find it easier (and cheaper) to improve swords, and will be able to improve them to be more powerful than a novice smith. An expert alchemist will be able to improve rings and amulets, and make essences to put on other weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaterials<br/>\nEach piece of equipment now has a material property. The material determines three things.<br/>\n- Some (not all) materials offer a base bonus to items (e.g. iron armor has SR 10).<br/>\n- The material determines how easy it is to improve an item's physical properties.<br/>\n- The material determines how easy it is to improve an item's magical properties.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for example, bronze is the basic metal for forging. A bronze sword has no base properties, and isn't particularly good for adding physical or magical properties. A silver sword has a base bonus vs shapechangers, is quite bad for adding mundane properties (it's a soft metal), but good for adding magical properties. Steel has no base properties, is very good for adding mundane properties (you can sharpen it well), but poor for adding magical properties (iron and steel are not friendly to magic). Mithril (spelt Mithral by the 1.69 patch writers, grr) makes the best equipment. Mithril items are lighter than normal, and take both mundane and magical improvements very well.<br/>\n<br/>\nItems with no Material property (i.e. everything in the current loot matrix) is treated as bronze/cotton, i.e. bad at taking both physical and magical improvements.<br/>\n<br/>\nImportant: How well a weapon/armor/accessory takes Magical enchantments also determines the chance of success when using an essence on them. The essence application will fail randomly on lower-grade items.<br/>\n<br/>\nProperties<br/>\nThe following properties are classed as 'mundane'. The difficulty of adding these to an item will be determined by how well the material takes mundane improvements.<br/>\n- AC bonus<br/>\n- Arcane spell failure<br/>\n- Attack bonus<br/>\n- Base item weight reduction<br/>\n- Enhancement bonus<br/>\n- Extra melee damage type<br/>\n- Extra ranged damage type<br/>\n- Keen<br/>\n- Massive Criticals<br/>\n- Mighty<br/>\n- Damage bonus (slashing/piercing/bludgeoning; other types are Magical)<br/>\n- Damage reduction (ditto)<br/>\n- Damage resistance (ditto)<br/>\n- Damage immunity (ditto)<br/>\n- AC vs damage type (ditto).<br/>\n<br/>\nNot all of these properties are available at present. All other properties (e.g. skill bonuses, damage bonus vs race/alignment, ability score bonuses) are classed as Magical properties.<br/>\n<br/>\nDifferent items take different properties. For example, only rings and amulets can add Ability Score bonuses.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpell focuses in Enchantment make it easier and cheaper to add Magical properties to items (i.e. they will not work on the list of mundane properties above but will work on all other properties).<br/>\n<br/>\nImproving items<br/>\nYou can improve items at any craft station, or at an enchantment basin (but enchantment basins will likely be removed in time). The Improve Item dialog is just like the old enchantment basin dialog, with one important difference - how costly it is to improve an item, how good an improvement you can make, and the chance of success all vary based on your craft skill (for the item type - so Tailoring for leather armor, Forging for metal armor etc etc), and the material and item property type (mundane vs magical).<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that makes sense. It's a departure from what you're used to, but should help specialise characters a lot more - in particular there is no such thing as a pure enchanter now, but enchantment-focused PCs will be more effective at adding magical properties (especially useful for tailors and alchemists who work with accessory items).<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing Essences<br/>\nEssences now have a chance of failure upon being applied to a weapon or a armor dependent on the material you are attempting to apply it to.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuccess Rates:<br/>\nAnything without a material property, Wood, Cotton, Copper, Iron, Steel, Hide, Leather = 33%<br/>\nIronwood, Silver, Ankheg, Wool = 66%<br/>\nDuskwood, Gold, Mithril, Silk, Dragonhide = 100%<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n11. Armor System<br/>\nArelith FL supports a new tactical melee system where warriors can wear heavy armor and gain large damage resistance bonuses for the exchange of AB. All armor in this new system will only grant the maximum base armor bonus of 3, (3 being the largest bonus you can get from light armor with a moderate dex limitation), this includes shields giving a maximum base shield bonus of 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nLight Armor<br/>\nClasses that wear light armor will receive small damage resistance bonuses from their armor, light users specialize in dodging and trying to avoid getting hit by using their dex bonus to improve their AC .. as opposed to heavy armor users that have large damage resistances and don't mind getting hit.<br/>\n<br/>\nMedium Armor<br/>\nClasses that wear medium armor will receive a moderate dex bonus to improve their AC and they will get better damage resistance than light armor, but their damage resistances will never be as good as heavy armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeavy Armor<br/>\nClasses that wear heavy armor receive a small dex bonus to improve their AC or nothing at all, but they receive very large damage resistances and are capable of withstanding damage over long periods of time. Full plated knights will be harder to damage than a rogue with leather armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlank Armor<br/>\nBlank armor without the universal resistances and AC penalty's can still be found within the module, these are items that may be carried by mobs, for the players that use heavy armor and would rather trade AC for damage resistances you can find blank items. Blank armor will never be considered greater than bronze for determining improvements in the crafting system, when improving it does not consider the existing damage resistant property on the item as opposed to a bronze item you have made.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTactical Melee<br/>\nWe want to promote a real time tactical melee system giving melee that extra element in close combat, you will now have the opportunity to react to your opponents fighting style and try to exploit their weaknesses whether that's for offense or defense. In FL you can buy a vast array of feats without any limit so you can specialize in a large number of different weapons for all situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nLight Armor: 10% Slashing Resistant<br/>\nMedium Armor: 25% Slashing Resistant<br/>\nHeavy Armor: 50% Slashing Resistant<br/>\nHelmets: 25% Bludgeoning Resistant<br/>\nSmall Shields: 10% Piercing Resistant<br/>\nLarge Shields: 25% Piercing Resistant<br/>\nTower Shields: 50% Piercing Resistant<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's just a for examples for you; On your travels your turn around a corner and your confronted by archers raining arrows down upon you, you would want to grab your shield and run for cover or charge into battle. The archers are quick on their feet but don't wear heavy armor so you grab your swords and begin a whirlwind of slashes that would leave any opponent in pieces.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou notice your opponent rarely wears a helmet so you grab your hammer or heavy mace for maximum damage, or just punch them in the face with your fists, or you may get your sling and begin hailing bullets.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour opponent uses a two-handed weapon and no shield, so you grab your bow and begin raining arrows at a distance, you pull out your twin daggers or a spear and go in for maximum damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour opponent uses a shield so you know he would be slower on the offense, so you grab your two weapons and go in for a flurry of strikes to put them on your back foot. You may even decide to duel wield two different weapons with different damage types for different situations.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nArmor Universal Property<br/>\nThis is a list of universal property's for items you can expect to see. These are only the BASE properties which means if you use the crafting system you can add additional benefits to these items, including more AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nVestures - Max Base Armor 0, Max Dex Bonus 10, Slashing Resist 0<br/>\nPadded Armors - Max Base Armor 1, Max Dex Bonus 8, Slashing Resist 0<br/>\nLeather Armors - Max Base Armor 2, Max Dex Bonus 6, Slashing Resist 10%<br/>\nStudded Leather Armors - Max Base Armor 3, Max Dex Bonus 4, Slashing Resist 10%<br/>\nChain Mail (Bronze) - Max Base Armor 3, Max Dex Bonus 4, Slashing Resist 5%<br/>\nChain Mail (Iron) - Max Base Armor 3, Max Dex Bonus 4, Slashing Resist 10%<br/>\nChain Mail (Steel) - Max Base Armor 3, Max Dex Bonus 4, Slashing Resist 25%<br/>\nChain Mail (Silver) - Max Base Armor 3, Max Dex Bonus 4, Slashing Resist 10%<br/>\nChain Mail (Mithral) - Max Base Armor 3, Max Dex Bonus 4, Slashing Resist 25%<br/>\nHeavy Armor (Bronze) - Max Base Armor 3, Max Dex Bonus 1, Slashing Resist 10%<br/>\nHeavy Armor (Iron) - Max Base Armor 3, Max Dex Bonus 1, Slashing Resist 25%<br/>\nHeavy Armor (Steel) - Max Base Armor 3, Max Dex Bonus 1, Slashing Resist 50%<br/>\nHeavy Armor (Silver) - Max Base Armor 3, Max Dex Bonus 1, Slashing Resist 10%<br/>\nHeavy Armor(Mithral) - Max Base Armor 3, Max Dex Bonus 1, Slashing Resist 50%<br/>\nHelmets - Bludgeoning Resist 25%<br/>\nBracers - Bludgeoning Resist 10%<br/>\nSmall Shields - Max Base Armor 1, Piercing Resist 10%<br/>\nLarge Shields - Max Base Armor 1, Piercing Resist 25%<br/>\nTower Shields - Max Base Armor 1, Piercing Resist 50%<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditional Special Property<br/>\nIron Weapons - 1D8 vs. Fey, 1 Massive Critical<br/>\nIron Armor - 10 Spell Resistance<br/>\nSteel Weapons - 1D4 Massive Critical<br/>\nSilver Weapons - 1D8 vs. Shapechanger<br/>\nSilver Armor - 0% Arcane Spell Failure<br/>\nMithral Weapons - 1D4 Criticals, 10% Weight<br/>\nMithral Armor - 10% Weight<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n12. 5% Epic Sacrifice<br/>\nFL Players can automatically enter the 5% Epic Sacrifice roll upon character deletion with chance to receive the standard rewards if you meet the following requirements.

Some spells and abilities will apply the old vanilla effect (like <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Barbarian\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Barbarian</a>'s terrifying rage or the Fear spell), while others will incur some penalties on a failed save, here named Fright.Standard Fright Aura: <ul><li>-10 AB</li> <li>-10 Saving Throws</li> <li>-10 Skills</li> <li>-10 AC</li> <li>50% Spell Failure</li> </ul> Lesser Fright Aura: <ul><li>-1 AB per level difference</li> <li>-1 Saving Throws per level difference</li> <li>-1 Skill per level difference</li> <li>-1 AC per level difference</li> <li>5% Spell Failure per level difference</li> </ul> Usually coming from summons, the lesser auras act according to a level difference. The greater the difference, the greater the effect.Lesser Fright Aura penalties never exceed -10/50% (+10 levels and will never be below -2/10%).Fright cannot be self-removed by the same frightened character. Attempting to self-recover using spells like Remove Fear will not dispel the effect, but will leave the lingering increased save bonus against fear effects.

(counting towards the +50 skill cap)</li> </ul> Negative effects <ul><li>They are prevented from equipping any ranged weapons; however, they can use throwing weapons (darts, shurikens, throwing axes).</li> <li>They cannot use potions, nor read scrolls. Neither they can take levels in any class with a spellbook. This includes bard, cleric, druid, paladin, ranger, sorcerer and wizard.<ul><li>They can, however, be affected by other character's magic. So be it positively or negatively.</li> <li>They may use items flagged as \"<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Misc_Changes#Mundane_Items\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">mundane</a>\". Some of these items are the Guaji Roots and the Powderkegs.</li> <li>They may use freely Raise Dead and Resurrection scrolls.

Therefore any Ranger can take levels in the Arcane Archer class without taking any levels in the Wizard, Bard or Sorcerer classes. He must still fulfill all other requirements for the class.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Barbarian</strong></span><br/>\n Arelith Changes <ul><li>A barbarian has two paths possible to choose on character creation: Kensai and Tribesman.</li> <li>When sufficiently drunk (below 0% sobriety) the Barbarian gains a boost to his strength.</li> </ul> Barbarian Rage<br/>\n The Rage has the following changes: <ul><li>Gives the barbarian a -2 penalty to AC.</li> <li>Increases the barbarian's movement rate by 50%.</li> <li>Gives the barbarian a damage shield effect, hurting anyone who strikes the barbarian in melee. Damage is 3x rage level + con bonus.</li> <li>Applies damage to the barbarian's main hand weapon based on barbarian's rage level.</li> <li>Boosts will save by rage level + con bonus.</li> <li>Gives temp HP = 50% of maximum HP, scaled by barb levels / hit dice.</li> <li>Duration is changed to 2d4 + con mod rounds.</li> </ul> Rage level is equal to a character's barbarian level divided by four (rounded up), plus one. For instance, a level nine barbarian will have a rage level of three.Terrifying Rage, Thundering Rage, and Mighty Rage all increase Rage Level by one.Barbarians can Rage unlimited times per day, provided they do not attempt to Rage when the effects are still active. This includes the period after the benefits of Rage have ended and the negative effects (AC penalty) linger. The cooldown period lasts one turn after the rage ends.The damage bonus will only apply to melee weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\n The only exception for this are throwing axes, which will behave exactly as melee weapons.You are drunkThree kinds of beverages decreases your sobriety: ale, wine (different kinds but same effect) and spirits. Drinking these will decrease sobriety and rest meter. How much they decrease depends on the CON stat of the character. This covers all character and not only Barbarians <ul><li>When a character gets drunk their DEX is decreased. More drunk means larger decrease.</li> <li>getting a sobriety of -10,0% - 0,01\u00a0% means a DEX decrease of 2, is sobriety -20,0% - 10,1% the DEX decrease is 4 etc etc.</li> <li>For every tick in negative sobriety the Decrease stacks. for example having a sobriety at -15% for one tick would mean a DEX decrease of 8.</li> <li>Reaching -100\u00a0% sobriety means the character dies of alcohol poisoning.</li> </ul><strong>Only Barbarians get the following benefit:</strong> <ul><li>When reaching a negative sobriety, the barbarian gets a bonus of +2 to their STR. At next tick the bonus rises to +5</li> <li>The bonus is a soft bonus and counts toward the +12 cap</li> </ul> TIP: when a tick takes you from Drunk to Sober the barbarian drunk-benefit remains for the next tick but at a +3 (This happens wither your bonus was +2 or +5). This means a carefully drinking barbarian can keep themselves in a two tick routine where they have +2 and +5 to STR with only minor DEX penalties. Any change to any meter (rest, drink, rest) will remove bonus STR when the barbarian is sober.when drunk <ul><li>Character has chance of stopping current action and laugh - frequency seems to increase as Sobriety decreases. <strong>Laughing and falling will make you flatfooted</strong></li> <li>Very low sobriety means the character also start falling</li> <li>To stop the laughing emote the player can emote sitting and it should stop momentarily.</li> </ul> Tribesman<br/>\n<br/>\n Instead of the normal <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Barbarian_rage\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">barbarian rage ability</a> the tribesman gets the ability to summon a tribal warrior for each rage. Only two can be called upon at the same time. <ul><li>They act as henchmen, so a summoned creature can be conjured as well</li> <li>They share race, sex and armour design of the player character. The armour design is what the player character has equipped when using the rage ability.</li> <li>They share the Barbarian level (not character level) of the player character.</li> <li>They <strong>DON'T</strong> share racial abilities with the Player character and they <strong>DON'T</strong> share any enchantments the player character has on their armour.</li> </ul> The Tribal Warrior has the following Ability scores at level 1: 16 Strength, 15 Dexterity, 14 Constitution and 10 Intelligencce, Charisma and Wisdom. Level 1 feats are: Ambidexterity, All Armour proficiencies, Rage, Fast Movement, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Power Attack, Shield Proficiency, Two-Weapon Fighting, Uncanny Dodge 1, Weapon Focii: Battleaxe, Handaxe, weapon prof: Martial, Simple Weapon Spec: Battleaxe, Handaxe.<strong>Progression of Tribal Warriors</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n The Tribal Warrior receives +1 AC every even numbered level, +1 Str every fourth level, and a feat every third level, which changes in epic levels - in essence, it levels as a \"default\" Barbarian character, including several more peculiar feats. It receives Barbarian Damage Reduction and Uncanny Dodge feats as a default Barbarian.The Tribal Warrior receives Power Attack at level 3, Cleave at 6, Great Cleave at 9, Improved Critical Greataxe (possible oversight) at 12, Weapon Focus Greataxe (possible oversight) at 15, Dodge at 18, Toughness at 21, Epic Focus Greataxe &amp; Epic Toughness I at 24, Epic Toughness II at 27, Epic Toughness III at 28, and Overwhelming Critical Greataxe (possible oversight) at 30. <ul><li>It is unknown what kind of AC bonus it receives (though, it is not Armour AC bonus).</li> <li>The Tribal warrior seems to get all Barbarian feats as it progresses. It also increases the Discipline score.</li> <li>Will equip battleaxe and handaxe, no matter what race - there are no enchantments or other properties applied, it is for all intents and purposes a bronze battleaxe and handaxe.</li> <li>Through testing, a Tribal Warrior hit 510 HP at level 30, and included the full complement of Barbarian DR feats.</li> <li>Throughout testing, at least one in ten tribesmen were male and bodyless save for armour (despite being female), which is probably a bug associated with appearance copying. Also, a fat barbarian will summon thin tribesmen.</li> </ul>\n<span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Bard (Warlock, Optional Path)</strong></span><br/>\n Warlock Class AbilitiesA Warlock is similar to a Bard, with the following changes: <ul><li>Bard Song is disabled (note that Curse Song is useless without Bard Song)</li> <li>Bardic Knowledge is disabled</li> <li>Hit Die changed to d8 (8HP/lvl)</li> <li><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Warlock#Warlock_Resilience\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Warlock Resilience</a> (seen below)</li> <li>Arcane Spell Failure for Armor and Shields is reduced by 20%</li> <li>Warlocks may cast unlimited spells from a <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Warlock#Warlock_Spell_List\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> pre-selected list</a>, based on their pact (regardless of which spells are chosen at level up, only those from the Warlock spell list will be available)</li> <li>A Ranged Touch Attack must be made for any spell cast against a hostile opponent, and successful hits will inflict <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Warlock#Eldritch_Blast\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Eldritch Blast</a> damage (Charm Person, Dominate Person, and Darkness will not inflict damage)</li> </ul> Warlock Eldritch Blast<br/>\n When a spell is cast directly on a hostile opponent, Eldritch Blast damage of (1d6 + 1) / 2 levels is dealt to the target, along with the spell effect. While an AoE spell may affect multiple opponents, Eldritch Blast damage is dealt only to the target of the spell. Spell Resistance checks are made separately for the base spell and Eldritch Blast damage, meaning that one may penetrate while the other is blocked.Using Eldritch Blast will cause the Warlock's eyes to glow.

Finding the same NPCs as the druids, they can take on a favored animal to bind themselves, but they will not receive any of the mechanical bonuses or penalties, nor will they be able to use the -polymorph command. The only change that they will experience is that (nearly) all their summons will take the form of their totem animal.A ranger that later multiclasses as druid will be able to <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Console_command#-polymorph\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">-polymorph</a>, but will never receive any of the other bonuses or penalties.

A character can become a wild mage at character creation, turning the wizard levels into wild mage levels, as long as they have no school specialization. A wizard may become a wild mage by finding the correct semi-secret NPC in the modules, but it will drop the character's level to below 6 (if above).Wild Mage class abilities <ul><li>(Same as wizard)</li> <li>Automatically gains Wild Magic passive.</li> <li>Automatically gains Chaotic Affinity passive.</li> <li>Automatically gains Wild Surge command.</li> <li>At level 9, gains Chaos Shield command.</li> <li>At level 21, gains Fatidical Manipulation command.</li> </ul> Wild Magic: Greater Wild SurgeWhenever a wild mage casts an <strong>arcane</strong> spell, there's a natural 5% that a Greater Wild Surge will trigger. Whenever this happens, both the spell and the surge will take place, and there's a chance that the spell will be replenished.To replenish a spell, a d100 is rolled against a DC defined by the WM's level and the spell's circle. The DC is lowered by 1 for each wild mage Level and an additional 3 for every 6th wild mage Level, so at level 30 the DC reduced by 45 with and 50% chance of replenishing a level 9 spell.Circle 1-4: Automatic successCircle 5 Spell DC: 35Circle 6 Spell DC: 50Circle 7 Spell DC: 65Circle 8 Spell DC: 80Circle 9 Spell DC: 95Epic: N/A <ul><li>If the spell is casted from any other spellbook, the spell will not be replenished.</li> </ul> Chaotic Affinity<br/>\n The Wild Surges from the wild mage will scale with the level, potentially becoming more effective, lasting and dangerous as the wild mage grows in power. Also, whenever the wild mage casts the spell Prismatic Spray, she will roll twice, affecting the target twice. <ul><li>Only the Wild Surges that occur through the wizard spellbook will scale in power.</li> </ul> Wild Surge<em>-Surge</em><br/>\n A wild mage can infuse the next spell with the chaotic energies of her Wild Magic, forcing a wild surge to trigger in the next casting. <ul><li>-Surge can only be used once per rest, with an additional use granted each 6 levels, receiving a total of 6 uses at level 30.</li> </ul> Chaos Shield<em>-Chaos</em><br/>\n At level 9, the wild mage's understanding of her strange magic grows to the point she can create a medium defensive aura around herself. For the duration of 1 round/Wild Mage levels, all enemies that enter the aura have 20% to receive a negative effect, and this chance will increase each time it fails, resetting back to 20% once it triggers. The effects can be negated with spell resistance, spell mantles and the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Cleric#Healer\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Healer Path</a>'s crowd control. These effects are not identical to that of the Surge Table, and some do not scale, depending whether the target is a PC or NPC. <ul><li>-Chaos can only be used once per rest.</li> </ul> Fatidical Manipulation<em>-Fate [number]</em><br/>\n At level 21, a wild mage's power has entered the epic threshold, finally gaining a glimpse of true comprehension of the seemingly entirely chaotic forces of her wild magic, taking it in her hands to shape her powers and limit the possible outcomes in the next surge. Using the table of wild magic as reference guide, you can input -fate and the number to get any effect from the number selected to the next seven. In example; using -fate 60 at level 21 would make the next surge be any between 60 to 67. Each wild mage level after 21 will reduce the range by 1, resulting in a perfect surge at level 28, removing all random factor. <ul><li>-Fate can only be used once per rest.</li> <li>If the selected value goes above 100, it loops back to 1 and so on.</li> <li>Gems, gold and teleport surges may not be fated.</li> <li>Surges that are usually saveless will roll for a save when they are fated.</li> </ul> The Wild Surge table<table class=\"post_content_table\"><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Caster is struck with drunkenness.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Fireball on Caster.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Caster is Held for 3 rounds.

This happens for two reasons: Some surges have a failure chance coded into them, and the rest fail to cast due to the lack of the intended targetting. This means that some surges will only trigger when you are targetting a character, the floor, yourself, etc. There's no way to prevent this at the moment, and could be considered simply wild magic bad luck.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Below is a chart of classes PRC means you must go through a DM to get access.

They help slightly or can behon</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>What are Gifts?</strong><br/>\n The Gift system allows characters to be empowered beyond the usual traits of their sub-race.Upon character creation after one has entered the world of Arelith, you will be presented with a list of optional 'Gifts' to select. Each chosen will effect your new character in a subtle fashion. However, most gifts will cause a modification to your ECL 'Effective Character Level'<br/>\n<br/>\n The more Gifts you have and the more powerful they are, the higher your ECL will be, altering the amount of XP you acquire and thus the amount of time your character takes to level up. The number and power of gifts each character may take will depend on their subrace's base ECL.<br/>\n<br/>\n It is also recommended that you have a reason behind each of your choices. Players are discouraged from taking things for purely mechanical or power gaming reasons.How many Gifts can I have?The number of Gifts a character may take depends on its subrace's base ECL, with fewer allowed to those with higher ECL.A Minor Gift may be taken in place of a Major Gift, if desired.<table class=\"post_content_table\"><tbody><tr><td>+0</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>+1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>+2</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>+3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></tbody></table>Example: <ul><li>A Drow, having a base ECL of +2, may take only one Minor Gift.</li> </ul><ul><li>A Human, having a base ECL of +0, may take as many as two Major Gifts and one Minor Gift.</li> </ul> Can I change my Gifts?<br/>\n<br/>\n Once chosen, gifts may never be lost nor may further gifts be taken later in a characters life.

A character with ECL +1 is treated as having a level 1 higher than normal for the purposes of calculating XP received. This serves to balance out the benefits that a character receives for choosing gifts by causing them to level more slowly.ECL does not influence the maximum level achievable on Arelith. All characters can reach level 30.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Feat Changes.</strong><br/>\n Disabled &amp; Obsolete Feats<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Devastating Critical</strong>: <em>\"In the judgement of the Dev Team it's unbalanced... You may not agree with the decision, but it's not going to change\"</em> <strong>-Mithreas</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Summon Mount, Mounted Combat and Mounted Archery</strong>: These feats are normally disabled. Characters, however, can still ride horses if they use a <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Epic_Sacrifice\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Medium Reward</a> for that purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Skill Focus &amp; Epic Skill Focus in any <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Skill_Changes#Disabled_.26_Obsolete_Skills\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Disabled &amp; Obsolete Skills</a></strong>:<br/>\n<br/>\n For obvious reasons, there is no benefit to taking feats which specifically improve Skills that have no use on Arelith.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Epic Spell: Epic Warding</strong>: This Feat is not <em>technically</em> disabled on Arelith. However, since PCs on Arelith are capped at Lv30, it is impossible to meet the prerequisites of the Feat with a PC.<br/>\n<br/>\n Note that some Epic Feats which can be taken multiple times suffer similar inhibitions with their later \"versions\" (Self Concealment V, for example, is unobtainable within 30 Levels).Modified Feats<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Arcane Defense: Abjuration</strong>: This Feat increases a spellcaster's effective Caster Level by +2 when trying to resist a dispel.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Brew Potion</strong>: On Arelith, all spells (Wiz/Sorc, Ranger, Druid and Cleric spells) from Level 0 up to Level 3 are \"potionable\", even spells that are normally not potionable in the default Neverwinter Nights, like True Strike, Expeditious Retreat, Camouflage, Entropic Shield and so on.<em>Note the Bug with Cleric Domain Spells and Item Creation Feats listed below</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Craft Wand</strong>: On Arelith, all spells (Wiz/Sorc, Ranger, Druid and Cleric spells) from Level 0 up to Level 4 are \"wandable\", even spells that are normally not wandable in the default Neverwinter Nights, like True Strike, Expeditious Retreat, Camouflage, Entropic Shield and so on. Divine Power and Invisibility Purge can not be wanded, and this exception is intentional.<em>Note the Bug with Cleric Domain Spells and Item Creation Feats listed below</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Defensive Casting</strong>: Defensive casting and other combat modes <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Feat_changes#Expertise.2FImproved_Expertise\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Expertise/Improved Expertise</a> are not disabled when your character moves.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Expertise/Improved Expertise</strong>: Expertise/Improved Expertise mode is automatically disabled when a spell is cast. Casters using this feat will need to re-enable it after every casting, and will not benefit from the bonus AC during casting.Expertise/Improved expertise and other combat modes (such as defensive casting) are not cancelled when you move.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Hide in Plain Sight</strong>: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Shadowdancer\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shadowdancers</a> will get this feat at level 5 instead. After leaving stealth mode, HIPS will have 2 rounds of cooldown before it can be used again. Note that other ways of sneaking still work while the cooldown is in effect.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Scribe Scroll</strong>: Certain Spells require an additional component to be scribed, which is consumed along with the Blank Scroll from your inventory. What components are needed for which spells is considered Find Out In Game information. Spells requiring a component are; <ul><li>Firestorm</li> <li>Greater Restoration</li> <li>Harm</li> <li>Storm of Vengeance</li> <li>Time Stop</li> <li>True Seeing</li> <li>Undeath to Death</li> </ul><em>Note the Bug with Cleric Domain Spells and Item Creation Feats and the Undeath to Death &amp; Remove Blindness/Deafness Scribing Bug listed below. Also, Greater Sanctuary is purposefully impossible to scribe.</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Epic Spell: Mummy Dust</strong>: Having this feat will grant access to the strongest variants of undead as per the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Spell_changes#Necromancy_changes\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">undead summoning changes</a>, but the spell by itself only works as any other undead summoning spell (It does not summon the mummy warrior).<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Wizard\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Wizards</a> and <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Sorcerer\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sorcerers</a> receive an additional effect with every Greater Spell Focus, detailed in their pages.<strong>Spell Focus: Abjuration</strong> <ul><li>Each Spell Focus in Abjuration grants a cumulative +2 to Dispelling Rolls, to a total of +6 with Epic Spell Focus: Abjuration. These are applied after the Level Cap imposed by individual spells (so an Epic Abjurer's Greater Dispelling caps at +26, not +20).</li> <li>With Spell Focus: Abjuration, the Shield spell protects against Isaac's Lesser Missile Storm as well as Magic Missile. With Greater Spell Focus, this protection extends also to Isaac's Greater Missile Storm.</li> <li>With Epic Spell Focus: Abjuration, the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Console_command#-ward\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">-ward</a> and <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Console_command#-ward_teleport\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">-ward teleport</a> Commands become available. The character may use one or the other of these, once per rest. -ward creates a large visible symbol on the floor, which lasts for a long time and inflicts brief paralysis on enemies who fail a Will Save upon passing over it. -ward teleport, while it lasts, prevents any PC from teleporting out of the area in question through any means, and prevents them from being -yoinked elsewhere whilst the remain in the area. It also prevents travel to any <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Portals\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portals</a> within the area.</li> </ul><strong>Spell Focus: Conjuration</strong> <ul><li>Each Spell Focus in Conjuration grants a small bonus to the statistics of creatures summoned by the [Lesser/Greater] Planar Binding Spells, and Epic Spell: Dragon Knight.</li> <li>Greater Spell Focus: Conjuration causes a caster to summon a creature one \"level\" higher than normal when using the Summon Creature I-VIII spells, in the same way as the bonus provided by the Cleric's Animal <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Animal_domain%7CAnimal\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Domain</a>. Note that Animal Domain and Greater Spell Focus: Conjuration <em><strong>do not</strong></em> stack in this respect. This feat will also grant <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Warlock#Fiendish_Summons\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fiendish Warlocks</a> an empowered version of their final summon, and allows Summon Creature IX to summon a more powerful Ancient Elemental.</li> <li>Epic Spell Focus: Conjuration enables the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Console_command#-yoink\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">-yoink</a> command. Once per rest, a character may send -yoink as a tell to another PC, which will cause them to enter a dialogue telling them that your PC is attempting to summon them. If they accept, they are transported instantly to your location.</li> </ul><strong>Spell Focus: Divination</strong> <ul><li>Spell Focus: Divination allows a character see whether a character is \"attuned\" to Life, Death, Fire, Water, Earth, or Air along the usual information of the Right Click&gt;Examine. Through trial and error association, a player may learn much about another character's habits and abilities from their attunement. Also allows a character to use the mysterious Deck of Stars item.</li> <li>Greater Spell Focus: Divination allows further information using <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Console_command#-investigate\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">-investigate</a>, <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Console_command#-detectevil\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Detect Evil</a>, and <em>other</em> things.</li> <li>With Epic Spell Focus: Divination, the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Console_command#-scry\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">-scry</a> command becomes available. Once per rest, with the Clairaudience/Clairvoyance spell active, the character may send -scry as a tell to another PC (or type -scry [START OF TARGET'S NAME]). This permits the character to spy on their target for roughly one minute. It is possible to protect against this, but means of doing so are considered Find Out In Game information.</li> </ul><strong>Spell Focus: Enchantment</strong> <ul><li>Each Spell Focus in Enchantment reduces the base cost of an enchantment when using the Enchantment Basin. This, in turn, means the chances of success with any given enchantment are increased, and that more valuable/powerful items can be created.</li> <li>The (non-cumulative) reduction in costs are 10% for Spell Focus, 20% for Greater Spell Focus, and 35% for Epic Spell Focus.</li> </ul><strong>Spell Focus: Evocation</strong> <ul><li>Epic Spell Focus: Evocation drastically improves both <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Greater_ruin\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Spell: Greater Ruin</a> and <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Hellball\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Spell: Hellball</a>, to several times their normal effectiveness. Without this focus, their power is equivalent to Vanilla NWN.</li> </ul><strong>Spell Focus: Illusion</strong> <ul><li>Epic Spell Focus: Illusion enables the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Console_command#-project_image\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">-project_image</a> command. Once per rest, the character may send -project_image as a tell to another PC or type -project_image [Character Name], after that the game will ask you to input your message, and the next sentence that you write will be hooked as your message.</li> </ul><ul><li>Your character's avatar, with the appropriate <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Console_command#-emote\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">-conjure or -cast visual</a> and/or polymorph state, will appear like a Speedy Messenger beside the target and relate your message. If you are targeting a PC on a different server, they will instead see only a \"Mysterious Ball of Light\".</li> </ul><ul><li>On addition to this, if no target is specified, it will create a copy of yourself with your current gear. The copy can fight, but it cannot cast spells. The copy will last 1 hour/caster level or until you rest. On top of this, you can speak through the copy using the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Console_command#-associate_.2F_-a\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">-a</a> command, and anything it hears will be relayed to you through the combat log.</li> </ul><strong>Spell Focus: Necromancy</strong> <ul><li>Greater Spell Focus: Necromancy turns Summoned Undead (from any Spell, Class Ability or Feat) into Henchmen. Your character may therefore have two undead minions at the same time. Note that the undeads <strong>must</strong> be summoned from different sources; casting two times Create Undead will not result in two minions.</li> <li>Epic Spell Focus: Necromancy will allow the caster to have three summoned undead at the same time.</li> </ul> For more information, read the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Spell_changes#Necromancy_changes\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Necromancy changes</a> article.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Spell Focus: Transmutation</strong> <ul><li>Greater Spell Focus: Transmutation allows a character, by travelling to the correct place (the location of which is Find Out In Game information), to activate Golems from their constituent parts so long as the character is Level 15 or over.</li> <li>Epic Spell Focus: Transmutation enables the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Console_command#-teleport\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">-teleport</a> command. This allows the character to open the same dialogue from a <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Portals\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portal</a> anywhere and travel to any known portal node. Usable once per rest, as long as the transmuter is not in a no-portal area, like the ones created by the epic abjurer.</li> </ul><strong>Weapon Finesse</strong> <ul><li>Works with Quarterstaff and Katana.</li> </ul><strong>Skill Changes</strong><br/>\n Disabled &amp; Obsolete Skills<br/>\n<strong>Ride</strong>: Ride is not needed to ride horses (this requires only a <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Epic_Sacrifice\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Normal Awards</a>), but is used in the wyvern riding fast travel system in the Underdark (details of this system are FOIG).<br/>\n<br/>\n Modified Skills<br/>\n<strong>Animal Empathy</strong>: Characters with 75% or more of their levels as ranger levels can turn animals into henchmen, allowing them to use Animal Empathy on more than one animal at one time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Appraise</strong>: Only base Appraise and INT modifications improve a character's ability to barter.

The same way that the quarterstaff will always be considered a two-sided weapon, and will always attack as a two-sided weapon.<strong>All double-sided and weapons held as two-handed by the character will grant an additional +2 AB</strong>.<br/>\n<strong>Katana</strong>: <ul><li>Can be <em>finessed</em>.</li> <li>Size changed from medium to small (thus smaller races can dual-wield them or use them with shield).</li> <li>Weigh changed from 10 lbs to 6 lbs.</li> </ul><strong>Quarterstaff</strong>: <ul><li>Is now a double-sided weapon, like the double-axe and the two-bladed sword.<ul><li>The offhand damage is based on your base unarmed damage score (default is 1d3, or 1d4 and above for monks).</li> <li>Like other double-sided weapons, its STR damage bonus is 1.0x for the main hand and 0.5 for the offhand attacks.</li> </ul></li><li>Can be <em>finessed</em></li> <li>Benefits from monk's UBAB progression.<ul><li>Cannot be used with Flurry of Blows.</li> </ul></li></ul><strong>Shuriken</strong>: <ul><li>Will benefit from the monk's UBAB progression.</li> </ul><strong>Spear</strong>: <ul><li>Damage lowered from 1d8/x3 to 1d6/x3</li> <li>Size changed from large to Medium, thus they can be wielded with a shield. Smaller characters, such as halfings and kobolds may use them as two-handed weapons.</li> </ul> Note that due to a bug, a spear with shield may not be quickslotted. There's a file to fix this available at <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5pQO_nzoHexZFZwQThkRlRqYmc/view\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google Drive</a>, just download and install in the Override folder.<strong>Throwing Axes</strong>: <ul><li>Will work along with Arelith's <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Barbarian\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Barbarian</a> Rage.</li> </ul><strong>Trident</strong>: <ul><li>Dice changed from 1d8/x2 to 2d6/x3. They are still large weapons, and thus they cannot be wielded with shield.</li> <li>Due to a bug, Weapon Focus feat will not work for tridents.</li> </ul>\n\n As to why it wasn't listed originally. I remembered seeing it, but its in a very obscure part of their wiki. (Not easily found, despite being semi-important.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Feel free to edit it in, I'm afraid to touch it since it sometimes goes empty on me xD<br/>\n<br/>\n Double apologies for the multi posts of information. But, you now have the majority of important build information on three to four posts, instead of having to search 13+ pages to get the same info (all in a neat orderly package. xD)<br/>\n \u00a0</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
