And I'm having issues with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most pressing of those is whether to focus on Charisma or Strength (or even Dexterity, but maybe that's for another time). It's one of those classes where min-maxing is nigh-on impossible - you need decent Cha in order to make use of many of the bonuses; decent Wis in order to use the spells; decent Int because you'll want at least <em>some </em>skills; and decent Str so you can hit stuff. So you're left with a dump in either Dex or Con, with everything else starting off around the not exactly inspiring 14 points. So the choice seems to be whether to excel in one - likely to be either Cha or Str - or to be mediocre in all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see the benefits of both, which is why I'm canvassing opinions from you good people. Let's assume a standard, medium-magic environment where you can't cap everything with gear: which would you prefer - a toon who could blow anything away a few times a day but was otherwise a bit meh, or one who could reliably batter things, albeit more slowly?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm trying to work around it a little by incorporating CoT (and probably Rogue), but to go further down that road takes me closer to the Build Request sub-forum, and away from this more general enquiry.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, all your opinions would be welcome, because I'm very torn atm.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Strength, constitution, wisdom and charisma are the most important. They should all have 14 or more.<br/>\nSpells will do a lot for you: Look at what they can do for your strength, charisma, AB, damage, saves and so on. <br/>\nYou definitely want the spells.<br/>\nAnd you want some charisma. Don't go over the top with it, unless you build a smiter. With a naked charisma of no more than 16, your capped charisma will be 28, enough for a +9 bonus for 9 rounds of DM and DS, and +9 to all saves. Nowadays I typically build my paladins with charisma 20 for a capped +11 bonus. Charisma is easy to cap. You have two stacking spells for it, so you don't need much in terms of item properties.<br/>\nYou are definitely right about strength being lower than in a focused strength build, but the way you can buff AB and damage with your spells compensates well for it, at least in a low- and mid magic mod.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if you feel you give up too much by starting with 14s and 15s, there is always the possibility to build with RDD and get a bonus to both strength and charisma. But that's not so different from what you do with Fighter/Bard/RDD builds.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks both!<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose part of this query comes from my having recently completed a full Baldur's Gate 1+2 play-through as an Undead Hunter Pally, which is one of the most OP builds in town, so I was a little underwhelmed when looking at the NwN version. Then again, I suppose they were striving for some balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand what you're saying, Mirnaia. It's about getting through those troublesome younger years to blossom later on. It's just that with Monks I've kind of got used to their foibles, while this is new for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMIck, I confess that I did have a look at Tyr's various versions of Pally/RDD via Hip's filter, which is one reason I decided to leave that alone for now. (Apart from anything else, she cheats by going with Bard in a few of them.). The other reason was that I find if I'm going to actually understand the build I don't want \"artificial\" boosts to it - in a similar sort of way as when you prodded me to go full Sorcerer. Now, I'm not suggesting a full Pally build here, just looking for decent starting points.<br/>\n<br/>\nEqually, I don't think a full-on smiter is my kind of thing. At the moment I'm falling more into the \"would like to stay around for the full fight\" camp than the \"need to knock him out in the first round\" one. So all the stat stuff is very useful, thanks. It's interesting that you don't mention Intelligence, though. In an ideal world, I'd like full skills in Discipline, either Listen or Spot, Taunt, Tumble and UMD (why I was thinking Rogue for tertiary class - and Tumble being particularly important if I'm dumping Dex), with maybe Concentration or Spellcraft if there were any spares. However, I realize that ain't gonna happen, but the question is: by how much ain't that gonna happen? Pally only gets 2 skill points + Int modifier p/level (another reason for thinking about adding Rogue), so if I'm left with only 10 or 12 in Int, that's only 2 or 3 maxed skills - so what to drop? Discipline is a given keeper, so that doesn't leave a lot of leeway. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm still feeling a bit \"Aargh!\"<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That's kind of what triggered the query in the first place. Is it better to cry out, \"Feel my might!\" then go for a lie down after a couple of minutes, or to pitch in and deal with the whole thing?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn secure vs extreme, atm I'm fannying about between various constructions involving Pal/CoT/Rogue: with Pally between 15 and 26, CoT between 10 and 22, and 3 or 4 levels of Rogue. I'm not sure where these come on the scale. We'll get there, though!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
