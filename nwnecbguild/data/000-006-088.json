      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hail, Mighty ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\nToday I come to you with a great collaborative project that <em class=\"mention\">@Stagmeister</em>\u00a0and I have been working on. The idea was to rework Yoshimo for Neverwinter Nights, without losing his essence. But, like I said in the Edwin Odesseiron topic, he's the perfect example that something has to give when making character adaptations between different systems. So, instead of going: \"this is the only possible interpretation\", we decided to post two interpretations, each one abdicating one aspect of the original BG character.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Baldur's Gate, Yoshimo was a bounty hunter, with the set snare ability. This part is easy to translate to NWN: Trap skills. However, he was more of a dex-based finesse kind of fighter, who dual-wielded Katanas. This aspect of his character is sadly not translatable to NWN, as Katanas aren't finessable, and dual-wielding feats give severe penalties when the off-hand weapon is larger than small (tiny for small races). So, I decided to build him without the feats, but in a way that was tweakable to include them if necessary. It isn't as easy to include these feats, but you could drop your starting STR to 16, then raise your DEX to 15, and then move 4 Fighter levels to pre-epic, drop 1 Great Strength and either Epic Prowess or Armor Skin, and Toughness pre-epic to take the dual-wielding feats. You lose 1 damage this way. I made him STR-based just because you can see the weapons in his portrait, and I couldn't see him without the \"samurai\" look he had in game. Then you can either dual-wield Katanas or dual-wield a Katana and a Kukri, without the WF feats on the off-hand weapon, unfortunately. Or you can switch to sword / board when necessary. The point of making this adaptation was to leave room for options. You also have the option to drop Listen and add points to bluff, cuz he was a two-faced bastard LOL, and a bit of UMD to reach 33. I prefer to drink a CHA potion if I need to cast from scrolls.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nMeanwhile, on his end, Stag worked on a dual-kukri DEX-based version of Yoshimo, for those who prefer to relinquish his trademark Katanas, but keep everything else about him. We went back and forth via e-mail optimizing both builds, until these final versions were reached. In the end, even if it's not a SINGLE build, surely one of them will resonate with Yoshi's fans as the closest to him one could get in NWN. Stag will post his build just below this one, so if you could please wait until he does so to post any comments, I'd appreciate it. All in all, I could see both builds being Yoshimo.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nLadies and Gentlemen, please welcome Yoshimo to our halls!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRogue(19), Fighter(20), Shadowdancer(1),

I did, however, keep exotic weapons, even if they can't be katanas. As Max says, he's a bounty hunter, and if he's going to do his job, he needs to be a sneaky, elusive trapper, so this is just an alternative take. We did take the same overall class split, just with a different implementation. Hopefully you'll find all the Yoshimo you could ever want here!<br/>\n<br/>\nFurther thanks to Max for being the trigger and the encouragement.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Yoshimo</strong>, Part 2<br/>\nRogue 19/ Fighter 20/ Shadowdancer 1, Human (Quick to Master)<br/>\nAny alignment (CN for RP purposes)<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 13<br/>\nDEX: 17 (34)<br/>\nCON: 14<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Rogue 1: Blind Fight/ Expertise<br/>\n02: Fighter 1: Weapon Finesse<br/>\n03: Fighter 2: Weapon Proficiency: Exotic/ Weapon Focus: Kukri<br/>\n04: Fighter 3: DEX+1 (18)<br/>\n05: Fighter 4: Weapon Specialization: Kukri<br/>\n06: Fighter 5: Knockdown<br/>\n07: Rogue 2: {Evasion}<br/>\n08: Rogue 3: DEX+1 (19)/ {Uncanny Dodge I}<br/>\n09: Fighter 6: Two-Weapon Fighting/ Ambidexterity<br/>\n10: Fighter 7:<br/>\n11: Fighter 8: Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br/>\n12: Fighter 9: DEX+1 (20)/ Improved Knockdown<br/>\n13: Rogue 4:<br/>\n14: Fighter 10: Improved Critical: Kukri<br/>\n15: Rogue 5: Toughness<br/>\n16: Rogue 6: DEX+1 (21)<br/>\n17: Rogue 7:<br/>\n18: Rogue 8: Dodge<br/>\n19: Fighter 11:<br/>\n20: Fighter 12: DEX+1 (22)/ Mobility<br/>\n21: Shadowdancer 1: Great Dexterity I (23)/ {HiPS}<br/>\n22: Fighter 13:<br/>\n23: Fighter 14: Epic Weapon Focus: Kukri<br/>\n24: Rogue 9: DEX+1 (24)/ Great Dexterity II (25)<br/>\n25: Rogue 10: {Improved Evasion}<br/>\n26: Rogue 11:<br/>\n27: Rogue 12: Great Dexterity III (26)<br/>\n28: Rogue 13: DEX+1 (27)/ {Defensive Roll}<br/>\n29: Rogue 14:<br/>\n30: Rogue 15: Great Dexterity IV (28)<br/>\n31: Rogue 16: {Epic Dodge}<br/>\n32: Fighter 15: DEX+1 (29)<br/>\n33: Fighter 16: Great Dexterity V (30)/ Epic Weapon Specialization: Kukri<br/>\n34: Fighter 17:<br/>\n35: Fighter 18: Armour Skin<br/>\n36: Fighter 19: DEX+1 (31)/ Great Dexterity VI (32)<br/>\n37: Fighter 20: Epic Prowess<br/>\n38: Rogue 17:<br/>\n39: Rogue 18: Great Dexterity VII (33)<br/>\n40: Rogue 19: DEX+1 (34)/ {Crippling Strike}<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 442<br/>\nSkillpoints: 351<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/ Will/ Reflex): 22/ 15/ 32<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: +4 v traps, +4 v spells<br/>\nBAB: 28<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 44 (melee), 41 (ranged), 42 (dual-wield kukris)<br/>\nAC (max naked/ +tower shield only): 32/ 35<br/>\nSpell Casting: UMD<br/>\nAlignment changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nBluff 16 (15), Disable Trap 42 (46), Hide 43 (55), Listen 43 (42), Move Silently 43 (55), Open Lock 2 (14), Search 21 (23), Set Trap 31 (45), Spellcraft (cc) 18 (20), Tumble 40 (52), UMD 34 (33)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Bluff 4, Disable Trap 4, Hide 4, Listen 4, Move Silently 4, Open Lock 2, Search 4, Set Trap 4, <br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Spellcraft 2, Tumble 4, UMD 4 (save 2)<br/>\n02: (save 7)<br/>\n03: Spellcraft 1 (save 10)<br/>\n04: (save 15)<br/>\n05: Spellcraft 1 (save 18)<br/>\n06: (save 23)<br/>\n07: Disable Trap 6, Hide 6, Move Silently 6, Tumble 6 (save 4)<br/>\n08: Disable Trap 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Set Trap 1, UMD 7 (save 4)<br/>\n09: Spellcraft 2 (save 5)<br/>\n10: (save 10)<br/>\n11: (save 15)<br/>\n12: (save 20)<br/>\n13: Disable Trap 3, Hide 5, Move Silently 5, Search 4, Set Trap 4, Tumble 5, UMD 5<br/>\n14: Spellcraft 2 (save 1)<br/>\n15: Disable Trap 4, Hide 2, Listen 1, Move Silently 2, Set Trap 3<br/>\n16: Disable Trap 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Search 4<br/>\n17: Disable Trap 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Search 2, Set Trap 1, Tumble 5<br/>\n18: Disable Trap 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Search 2, Set Trap 1, UMD 5<br/>\n19: Spellcraft 2 (save 1)<br/>\n20: (save 6)<br/>\n21: Hide 3, Listen 3, Move Silently 3 (save 6)<br/>\n22: Spellcraft 1 (save 9)<br/>\n23: (save 14)<br/>\n24: Disable Trap 4, Hide 3, Move Silently 3, Set Trap 5, Tumble 5, UMD 5<br/>\n25: Disable Trap 3, Hide 1, Listen 2, Move Silently 1, Set Trap2, Spellcraft 1<br/>\n26: Disable Trap 1, Hide 1, Listen 4, Move Silently 1, Search 3, Set Trap 1<br/>\n27: Disable Trap 1, Hide 1, Listen 2, Move Silently 1, Set Trap 1, Tumble 5<br/>\n28: Disable Trap 1, Hide 1, Move Silently 1, Set Trap 1, Spellcraft 1, UMD 5<br/>\n29: Disable Trap 1, Hide 1, Listen 5, Move Silently 1, Search 2, Set Trap 1<br/>\n30: Bluff 4.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks, gkorjax!<br/>\n<br/>\nI hear you about Crippling Strike. But everything has a price, and to bring it in earlier means one of several things. 1) Swap it with one of Imp Evasion/ Def Roll/ ED, but that means delaying ED to level 40 (surely not a good idea). 2) Lose SD for another Rogue level and so a late skills dump, but that means delaying your epic combat feats and losing HiPs (though you would gain 2 pre-epic feats). Again, not a trade I fancy.\u00a0 3) Take ED as a general feat, but that means losing 1 Great Dex, so you'd have to drop another one (maybe for a Great Str to up damage by +1). You'd also lose 1 AB, 1 AC, and 1 to your Reflex save. Another price I'd rather not pay.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, taking earlier Crippling Strike is do-able, but just because you <em>can</em> doesn't mean you <em>should</em>.

Not trying advise you not to take DevCrit, but here's why I didn't go for it. You're a STR-based character with a very good weapon and lots of d6 of Sneak Attack dice to add to your attacks, so you'll really only struggle against Sneak-immune enemies, which are also crit-immune, except for Dwarven Defenders. Plus the DC isn't really that spectacular with only 34 STR, so I'd prefer the extra BAB to DevCrit on this one.<br/>\n<br/>\nYMMV.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Not trying advise you not to take DevCrit, but here's why I didn't go for it. You're a STR-based character with a very good weapon and lots of d6 of Sneak Attack dice to add to your attacks, so you'll really only struggle against Sneak-immune enemies, which are also crit-immune, except for Dwarven Defenders. Plus the DC isn't really that spectacular with only 34 STR, so I'd prefer the extra BAB to DevCrit on this one.<br/>\n<br/>\nYMMV.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!</div></blockquote>\nYeah I completely understand the reasoning behind not taking it on the base build, and the origional version is superior for soloing. But I will be playing this alongside a cleric so I figured I could reasonably sacrifice the AB point for the occasional instant kill, plus the hilarious moments when you instantly kill snurres pet dragon for example while in a discord call bantering.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
