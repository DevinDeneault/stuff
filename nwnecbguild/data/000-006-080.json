      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Me again, with another concept that came to me while writing something else (at least it wasn't name-driven this time). So I built up the back-story, then built up the build (maybe not the traditional way, but hey-ho). And then I scanned the annals...Only the one in the Guild Filter: Empyre's\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/elves-can-be-tanks-too-monk-25-cot-10-shadowdancer-t515529.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Elves Can be Tanks, Too</a> from 2011, but that one goes heavy on DR. There were 5 of the same class combo in the Archive, though only 2 with the same levels and race (elf - 2 of the others being hins, and the other having a M20/ SD10/ CoT10 split and kama-focused), 1 of which was archery-focused, which is impossible for my concept. And that left one: the\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build198552.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Zen Guardian</a>. At the risk of going up against the Dwarflord himself, for 'twas indeed he wot wrote it, in compare and contrast contests, I figured \"Sod it, I've worked on this - I'm putting it up anyway\".<br/>\n<br/>\nStory first, build after.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>The Unbowed</strong></span><br/>\n<br/>\n\"I have learned to not hate my parents.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter all, they could have done so much worse. I have been told they were both sworn to Solonor Thelandira, and so the bow. How should they have responded to the birth of their one-armed son?<br/>\n<br/>\nThey set aside what many would consider the 'easiest' option, instead leaving me upon the steps of a remote human temple of Ilmater, where I was taken in and raised by the monks of the Yellow Rose and their sensei, Kane, the Grandmaster of Flowers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere I learned many things, not least of which was that I had an easier life than those with four limbs: I, after all, had only to learn to control and master three. I confess, that lesson took some time to settle in. Still, learn I did, and became somewhat proficient in - ironically - unarmed combat, and how I might make greater use of my lower limbs than many ever consider: for balance, for speed, for agility...and for attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet, as the years of man passed, much as I came to respect and admire both Ilmater and those of the Yellow Rose, I had no love or purpose in my heart.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, one night, while fasting in a small glade of a sparse and sharp forest on a mountainside, I was visited by a waking dream - or nightmare. The night was suddenly broken by a pair of huge, almond-shaped eyes that filled the glade: piercing, gleaming - their colour shifting from purple to azure to emerald to silver to black, and finally to gold. As my panic subsided, and the eyes merely maintained their intent gaze, I began to wonder...was this a god? But who was I to warrant the attention? Could it be Solonor himself, come to observe the flowering of his abandoned child? For was he not also the god of survival in harsh, wild places?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then came the disembodied voice. Rich, musical, yet low, measured, and menacing. <em>The world is a harsh and unforgiving place, with uncompromising demands on those who would forge their own path. Rely not on others for protection, for betrayal comes easily, but on the skills of camouflage, deception, and secrecy. Follow the Way of the Lone Wolf</em>.<br/>\n<br/>\nThus did I hear for the first time the voice of my master. Fenmarel Mestarine the Lost - god of outcasts, scapegoats, and isolation. I fell to my knees and dropped my head, only to hear: <em>No. You are one of mine, and we do not bow. Rise, and learn anew.</em><br/>\n<br/>\nI never returned to the Ilmateri monastery - though there are times I miss my fellows, I admit. I remained in that ancient glade in those ancient forests and mountains, and I was taught the Way of the Lone Wolf by the god himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter many seasons of man, Fenmarel spoke to me once more, and I left the glade and entered the world. Entered it as one who will forever stand for and before those whom that world and its denizens would persecute and mock. Let the world do its worst.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am the Unbowed.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>The Unbowed</strong><br/>\nMonk 25/ Champion of Fenmarel 10/ SD 5<br/>\nElf: any lawful non-evil (I went LG, but LN makes sense, too)<br/>\nPvM 1-40<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Stats</strong><br/>\nSTR 12<br/>\nDEX 18 (34)<br/>\nCON 10<br/>\nWIS 14<br/>\nINT 14<br/>\nCHA 8<br/>\n<br/>\nHPs: 380<br/>\nAC: (naked/robes only) 39 (+1 Dodge, +1 Shadow Evade)<br/>\nDR: 20/+1<br/>\nSR: 35 (undispellable)<br/>\nSaves: Fort 28, Will 27, Reflex 42 (+4 v spells, immune to mind spells)<br/>\nSkills: 248.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I would not do Circle Kick in this build.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this is why - KD (and IKD) have great uses in knocking down Spellcasters (among other things) - and with Circle Kick, one can KD two opponents in one round.\u00a0 But it also switches the focus to another opponent, which can be rather troublesome when one is trying to KD a spellcaster and keep the focus on it (to prevent spellcasting).<br/>\n<br/>\nI include Circle Kick in two Monk builds - SR and Disarm.\u00a0 Otherwise, it gives spellcasters a chance to get a spell or two off - and that is never a good thing if one is not immune to spells.\u00a0 For the disarmer, it is to get as many opponents as quickly as possible weaponless, which makes for a really easy combat session as they all try to punch the Monk with their bare fists.<br/>\n<br/>\nLuckily, you have HiPS.\u00a0 You can activate this after KDing two opponents (and just...disappear) and then switch back to the spellcaster unseen.<br/>\n<br/>\nCircle Kick is imo hard to manage, and only really worth it in a few circumstances (see above) imo.\u00a0 I really like it in the two builds that I run with it - but otherwise, it is bound to frustrate as your Monk goes off on another opponent, letting the spellcaster get his defences up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took me awhile to get to this conclusion, because I was curious about the changes BD has made (re: fixing the standing still and doing nothing bug). Obviously, a Monk with UMD that can also tank the spells due to high SR will enjoy Circle Kick to the fullest, and a Disarm Monk will be putting the hurt down on melees who depend on weapons and weapon feats to deal out the damage.\u00a0 If one could just switch it on or off much like FoB that would be really cool, but as it works with FoB, I guess that just would require doing too much engine work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Expertise - imo this build does not need it with HiPS.\u00a0 Your goto is going to be HiPS cheese, and after experiencing it, it is hard to let go.\u00a0 Especially in an environment where HiPS is not on a cooldown and there is no vanilla TS (or creatures with it).\u00a0 <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, loosing 5 AB for more AC is not a great plan for Monk based fighters.\u00a0 The AB is already a bit low, and that will make it a \"fishing for 20s\" scenario.\u00a0 Toughness is always a good goto for Monks due to the rather low end HPs. However, if one had feats to burn, it would allow the Monk to increase AC when drinking a potion - but as this build has HiPS, one can do that anyway (HiPS, drink)).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, it is normally Fists OR Kamas.\u00a0 Trying to squeeze in both really results in less than desirable results as it costs extra feats that could probably be used for other ones that have more impact in the build.\u00a0 Like more Dex, etc (especially as Dex increases AC, AB, and Sneak/Hide, etc).\u00a0 <br/>\n<br/>\nI've been doing a lot of Dexxers lately, and Dex based Monks seem to do better in the environment where I play (I also have a Str based RDD version, and it is just not as effective as the Dexxer is in most situations).\u00a0 Also, it seems that the Fist based Monk has a leg up on the Kama based Monks in a low to medium magic based environment in my experience.\u00a0 YMMV.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Tbc in another build...). Simplistically, that gives me a free general feat pre-epic, which could usefully be spent on Iron Will or Great Fort. But there might be better options - maybe dropping a couple of pre-epic CoT levels and sliding Imp Crit into the vacant general feat slot, which would give an extra epic CoT bonus feat, while getting d20 fists earlier by having an extra level of Monk and SD in their (CoT) pre-epic spaces. That would mean having a stern look at my starting stats, as I'd be looking for a Great Wis as the CoT bonus feat...<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll go and have a furtle...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, Web!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Well that didn't take long. I have a few unwritten rules about my melee builds: I never drop Str below 12 in a Dex build, nor Dex below 10 in a Str one, and I never have less than max APR (min 16 BAB - and yes, I know monk APR works differently, but that's no excuse. And also yes, I know about the cleric stuff where you want no more than 3 APR, but again, that's different and they're weird). Thus my furtling leads me nowhere, as I end up with with a BAB of 15 whichever way I cut it. Up with which I will not put. So, a bit of a bonus to Will or Fort it is. I'd have only ended up with +1 to Will saves and +1 to AC, neither of which are too shabby anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext, please!
