PARTY:</strong><br/>\n1.\u00a0 Classic Christmas songs to bring the party to life (Level 21 Bard Song).<br/>\n<br/>\n2.\u00a0 Any Justin Beaver song to assault your enemies' senses (Level 22 Curse Song).<br/>\n<br/>\n3.\u00a0 Unparalleled, interracial FLIRTING (56 unbuffed Taunt) to catch your foes off-guard, and make casters fumble because we all know that every wickedly powerful wizard is a nervous adolescent deep inside (-6 AC max, 30% spell failure). <br/>\n<br/>\n4.\u00a0 Can DJ all night long (Lasting Inspiration).<br/>\n<br/>\n5.\u00a0 HiPS.\u00a0 Yes, yes, Ava's got the curves...but I'm talking about sneaking here.\u00a0 Yup, she can do both.<br/>\n<br/>\n6.\u00a0 Gossip!\u00a0 Because we all need to know that Dai-Vyd is getting boobs due to his wife Llora adding a strange concoction to his morning drink after finding out that he's sleeping with the artificer next door, whose alchemist brother has been secretly scrying them but has been caught by Llora because his window was open during market day of all days(!), and has been coerced into brewing the said concoction (31 unbuffed Listen, 60 with Amplify and Bard Song).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Ava's other talents:</strong><br/>\n1.\u00a0 Still Spell (in a DEX BARD?!)<br/>\n\u00a0-\u00a0 Quality of life.\u00a0 She CAN wear leather and shield so the ability to buff without stripping and cast during battle is a godsend.\u00a0 This is especially useful when adventuring since you want to use low duration buffs such as Amplify, Haste, Improved Invi and War Cry only when needed, which is usually during an encounter.<br/>\n\u00a0-\u00a0 Spell slot flexibility.\u00a0 No rogue?\u00a0 Ava can have 8 Find Traps.\u00a0 Consigned to counterspelling?\u00a0 She can have the Dispel line of spells up to level 6.\u00a0 Healer?\u00a0 She can during battle, and if she's wearing robes, she can have 8 Cure Criticals and 8 Healing Circles.\u00a0 In high magic modules where majority of her buffs become obsolete, this flexibility gets her better mileage on her spellcasting.<br/>\n<em>*** If you play in a PW, you can pick Craft Wand instead.\u00a0 I play on modules with friends so XP is a commodity.</em><br/>\n<br/>\n2.\u00a0 Undispellable (except for Mord's).<br/>\n3.\u00a0 Epic Dodge<br/>\n4.\u00a0 Immediate detection of non-epic traps at level 18.<br/>\n5.\u00a0 Disarm Traps with DC &lt; 36 at level 24 with Bard Song | at level 13 with +6 INT &amp; Bard Song | at level 18 with +4 INT &amp; Bard Song.<br/>\n6.\u00a0 UMD<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>What Ava is SAD about:</strong><br/>\n1.\u00a0 8 STR.\u00a0 Low carry weight.\u00a0 Low damage.<br/>\n2.\u00a0 Low health,\u00a0 <em>from all the late-night partying probably.</em><br/>\n3.\u00a0 3 attacks per round.<br/>\n4.\u00a0 Low unbuffed AB (37)<br/>\n5.\u00a0 Dependent on UMD and Bard Song for damage.<br/>\n6.\u00a0 Low Fort (21) and Will (20)saves.<br/>\n7.\u00a0 No active combat feats (KD/IKD, Expertise/IE).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Ava's Spells:</strong><br/>\nLevel 1:\u00a0 Amplify, Identify, Lesser Dispel, Mage Armor, Protection from Alignment | <em>Magic Weapon for Lesser Dispel (until you get GMW)</em><br/>\nLevel 2:\u00a0 Bull's Strength, Cat's Grace, Darkness, Ghostly visage, Ultravision<br/>\nLevel 3:\u00a0 Dispel Magic, Find Traps, GMW, Haste, Displacement<br/>\nLevel 4:\u00a0 Cure Critical Wounds, Dismissal, Improved Invisibility, Neutralize Poison, War Cry<br/>\nLevel 5:\u00a0 Ethereal Visage, Greater Dispelling, Healing Circle, Mind Fog, Summon Creature V<br/>\nLevel 6:\u00a0 Dirge, Energy Buffer, Ice Storm, Mass Haste<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Builder's Comments:</strong><br/>\nI couldn't find a DEX-based, \"pure\" Bard in our guild that <em><strong>sang </strong></em>to me so I thought to try my hand at it.\u00a0 I was looking for 2 things:\u00a0 First is early Lasting Inspiration and Epic Dodge because I don't want to wait until level 40 to be 100% complete at my role (or enjoy the \"full\" build).\u00a0 The second is the ability to play well in any party composition so she can fill the gaps when needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAva -

levels 27 and 30 respectively.\u00a0 However, I wasn't satisfied with the feat and skill point distribution since I had to constrict myself to getting LI and ED on those levels.\u00a0 Other problems I encountered are arcane spell failure from using Leather + Shield, AND lack of spell slots/duration for my key buffs (especially if resting is restricted).<br/>\n<br/>\nThese factors led me to redesign and come up with the final version.\u00a0 I adjusted the stats to get rid of Toughness and replace it with a spell feat for better slot management (originally Extend Spell, but I decided that Still Spell would have more universal applications).\u00a0 This version also allowed me to take more ESFs at key stages of leveling to ensure that Ava's skills are always relevant.\u00a0 This comes at the expense of 1 AB and Epic Dodge coming in at level 36 (6 levels late).\u00a0 Being a dexer with HiPS + buffs can definitely help with the late ED, and -1 AB in a Taunt build isn't significant.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm quite happy with the end result - a support character who can solo, and has enough tricks to cover gaps in a party.\u00a0 I'm also confident that in a group with multiple bards - with a 16/4 pre-epic split and skill/feat distribution - she's ALMOST always gonna have the most potent Bard Song when leveling,\u00a0 while still making her playable.\u00a0 <br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, I submit this to the wise builders of our guild to help me improve Ava even more.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are no builds in the guild with the exact class distribution, which probably means there are inherent problems with the build or is outclassed by a similar concept.\u00a0 Ava felt fun to play and was easier to solo than I expected - so if anyone can let me know why no one bothered with this (or maybe I didn't search hard enough?), that would be insightful. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilar Class Split:\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>\nStrategic

      "content": "<div>Hi <em class=\"mention\">@Roxiee</em> , she looks like a lot of fun to play. Do you have a Bard build that you like but without the SD or ay other PrCs?<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like the sound of Lasting Inspiration,\u00a0epic old-style music that just goes on and on because it feels right. I'm thinking 'Donna Summer - I Feel Love [Extended Dance Edit]' with an extended intro, or an extended-extended bass intro to 'The Breeders - Cannonball'; or 'The Immigrant Song - Led Zeppelin'; or just 10 minutes of moar cowbell!<br/>\n<br/>\n*donk donk donk donk donk*<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Don't forget playing 'Bon Jovi - Livin' On A Prayer' when the party has a Cleric or something <span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83d\ude07</span></div>"

      "content": "<div>Thanks <em class=\"mention\">@Roxiee</em> , I hope you're having a good time off (with Ava?), and I appreciate you getting back to me especially with a proper, meaningful reply <span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83d\ude01</span> I'm seeing (DM) explosions etc. as they walk away not looking back <span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83c\udf86</span><br/>\n<br/>\nI'm actually loving the +7d6 sneak attacks in exchange for HiPS - go in with a party, go in bright, go in loud and bring the thunder! *to AC/DC Thunderstruck* \u26c8 (or the 2Cellos version)<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm really green to playing spell casters so I'm so glad you've included a bill of Spells, I've not really touched on spells, let alone Bard ones. There are also a lot of design choices that are alien to me, like Still Spell and KD - correct me if I'm missing the point, but are you expecting tougher armor because of swapping out HiPS? I like KD - I can just see them doing a roll onto the opponent's back and roundhouse sweep from the back, then +7d6 hits, completely overcomes my skeptisism with Dex fighters <span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83e\udd13</span> Is there a reason you've raised UMD to 33(36) by the way?<br/>\n<br/>\nLooks so versatile, I am so keen to try this out!</div>"

      "content": "<div>KD is there for a consistent source of sneak attacks.  If you find yourself missing even after buffs, use Taunt and Curse Song to get up to +11 to 12AB (translated from -11 to 12AC on your opponent).<br/>\n<br/>\nStill Spell is there since you can wear leather armor which are usually better than robes, AC-wise.  And leather incurs 5% arcane failure so you need Still Spell to get around that.  Shields also add more to that with 5%, 15% and 50% for small, large and tower shields respectively.  Don't expect you to wear tower btw, that will take a lot from your carrying capacity!  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the best use of Still Spell there is really spellbook management so you can cast your favorite spells at another spell slot.  Imagine having Displacement (not affected by arcane failure) at level 3 and 4, stilled!  Or Improved Invi at level 5, stilled, so you can cast on demand due to the short duration instead of running around with it.  These are especially useful in rest-restricted modules!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd 36 UMD since unbuffed, your level 26 Bard song gives you + 9 to skills.  That gives you 45 UMD to have access to restricted gear especially in high magic worlds.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh and she's a dexer with low STR and only 37 base AB so you will need to use the tricks available to her during leveling.  If you're accustomed to playing straight-up fighters, esp STR-based ones, you might find yourself frustated in her teens ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk</div>"
