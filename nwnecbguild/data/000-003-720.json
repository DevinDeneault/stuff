      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hello all!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was looking, four days ago, at the builds hosted on both on older and newer ECB guilds, to see how I could design the first PC to be designed for my solo playthrough in WoG server.<br/>\nFirst note: this is to be a bard, but not the bard/fighter/RDD that I have previously played;<br/>\nSecond note: pale master builds have been posted in the forum, and never played one. So, PM as a second class.<br/>\nThird note: I played a little of offline module as a Bard14/Sorcerer26 (\"optimized\" with our <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/bard-orcerer-a-viable-design-t2355176.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">comments</a>). Bard song, in epic levels and with epic bosses, does not last enough even with \"lingering song\", and should be saved (even when someone would need it) in \"middle\" fights in order to have 3/4 songs for the last match. --&gt; need lasting inspiration.<br/>\n<br/>\nSearch after search (as bard/palemaster builds are countless), I only found one of the builds satisfying many of the these requisites:\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build253956.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mourning glory</a> by Kail Pendragon.<br/>\n<br/>\nBadass build, that's for sure. But I wondered: is it possible to concile an undispellability (from dispels other than Mords) with PM levels? No builds seem to have posted with this aim.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere you can find both a 2-hand weapon version, and a sword and board build.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span

Discipline(14), Listen(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(15), <br/>\n<br/>\nEach of the versions have higher AB than the mentioned build (39 vs 37), almost the same HP (394 vs 399), slightly less saves and -4 AC.<br/>\nThanks to bards' and fighter's epic bonus feats, there is more room for great strenght, so damage is better (1d10+27 for halberd, and 1d10+22 for sword'n board version).<br/>\nHowever, they are not immune to fire and (most important thing) cannot count on \"Epic warding\" and \"Epic mage armor\". the first one is a situational spell, that does not last long and that can be compensating through expertise + bard + course song, that can rise the AC and help it to reach that 70 AC, avoiding as much as possible the enemies' attacks.<br/>\nThe (huge) loss of epic mage armor, I think, is only to be considered as a \"minor\" chance to cap STR and CON, the only abilities that are worth of maximization here.<br/>\nAlso, a lasting bard song is equal to more uses of curse song, so AB can be often risen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAC = (two-hander) base 33 + deflection/natural/armor bonus/dodge 5 = 53+ 4 (haste) + 1 (mage armor) + 7 (combined songs) + 2 DEX (situational) = 67*<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (sword and board) base 36 + def/nat/armor bon/dodge 5 = 56 + bonus shield 4 + haste+mage armor+songs+DEX = 74<br/>\n*can be risen, in WoG, to 71 due to the bracers of shielding (shield AC). <br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of considerations from my side:\n<ul>\n<li>Basically, the 12th Pale master level is a free armor skin feat. Trying to reach lv 13, to obtain an energy resistance feat would compromise the \"undispellability\" from dispels/greater dispellings and \"specialization\" feats.</li>\n<li>I thought to remove one of the feats among \"improved knockdown\" or \"improved critical\" for \"expertise\", especially for the 2-hand version. For the \"sword and board\" version, I can replace bastard sword with scimitar or another slashing weapon, or even with morning star, to remove the \"exotic weapon proficiency\".</li>\n<li>I have added craft wand feat only because of WOG server, and I would replace it with Expertise if I had to play an offline module.</li>\n<li>Weapon specialization and epic version provide 6 damage, enough to compensate the lack of RDD class (at least, for damage). I can max taunt, to raise the AB more.</li>\n<li>At least in the 2-hand weapon version I could take armor skin, to help AC.</li>\n</ul>\n\nNow on with your comments! :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I've never played on WoG so some of what I write below might be bad advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst I would change the level layout to Bard24/Figh6/PM10 and change the pre-epic spread to Bard16/Figh4 for the APR increase. If you want the AC back you can switch 2 G STR feats for Armor Skin and something else (like ESF: Disc or ESF: Taunt). Change your first level to Bard and the second level to Fighter, the extra skill points are needed in this build.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a shame that you only get enough Perform for a level 16 Bard Song but if the extra skill boost isn't worth it on WoG then it should be fine. 1 point in Disable Trap is a lot more useful than that 1 point in Search. 33 UMD is required to use a level 9 scroll without failure, with the +4 skill boost from a level 16 Bard Song you would need 29 base UMD rather than 25. You can move some points from Listen to elsewhere since you can get +30 Listen from Bard spells. I would opt for getting Taunt, although you would have to increase your INT to 16 since bards are pretty skill-starved.<br/>\n<br/>\nBelow is a rough draft for how I would make this build, although some things need tweaking like the level order and skills.<br/>\nIExp would be a nice addition but it requires dropping either IKD or Toughness. Still Spell can be swapped with Extend Spell, I chose Extend Spell for personal preference. ESF: Taunt can be replaced with another epic feat like ESF: Disc or Epic Fortitude, although some feat shuffling may be required.<br/>\nSince it's a rough build I didn't bother with a full skill progression, just the final ranks.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nClass: Bard 24 / Fighter 6 / Pale Master 10<br/>\nRace: Human<br/>\nAlignment: CE / CN / NE / TN<br/>\nPlayability: 1-40\u00a0 PvM<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 14 (26)<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 14<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 16<br/>\nCHA: 15 (16)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Bard(1): Blind Fight, Expertise<br/>\n02: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br/>\n03: Bard(2): Curse Song<br/>\n04: Bard(3): CHA+1, (CHA=16)<br/>\n05: Bard(4)<br/>\n06: Bard(5): Craft Wand<br/>\n07: Bard(6)<br/>\n08: Bard(7): STR+1, (STR=15)<br/>\n09: Fighter(2): Extend Spell, Knockdown<br/>\n10: Fighter(3)<br/>\n11: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Scimitar<br/>\n12: Bard(8): STR+1, Improved Critical: Scimitar, (STR=16)<br/>\n13: Bard(9)<br/>\n14: Bard(10)<br/>\n15: Bard(11): Improved Knockdown<br/>\n16: Bard(12): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n17: Bard(13)<br/>\n18: Bard(14): Toughness<br/>\n19: Bard(15)<br/>\n20: Bard(16): STR+1, (STR=18)<br/>\n21: Pale Master(1): Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br/>\n22: Pale Master(2)<br/>\n23: Pale Master(3)<br/>\n24: Pale Master(4): STR+1, Epic Prowess, (STR=19)<br/>\n25: Pale Master(5)<br/>\n26: Pale Master(6)<br/>\n27: Pale Master(7): Armor Skin<br/>\n28: Pale Master(8): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n29: Pale Master(9)<br/>\n30: Pale Master(10): Great Strength I, (STR=21)<br/>\n31: Bard(17)<br/>\n32: Fighter(5): STR+1, (STR=22)<br/>\n33: Fighter(6): Great Strength II, Epic Weapon Specialization: Scimitar, (STR=23)<br/>\n34: Bard(18)<br/>\n35: Bard(19)<br/>\n36: Bard(20): STR+1, Lasting Inspiration, (STR=24)<br/>\n37: Bard(21)<br/>\n38: Bard(22)<br/>\n39: Bard(23): Great Strength III, Epic Skill Focus: Taunt, (STR=25)<br/>\n40: Bard(24): STR+1, (STR=26)<br/>\n<br/>\nConcentration 43(45), Disable Trap 1(4), Discipline 43(51), Listen 23(22), Open Lock 1(0), Perform 43(46), Pick Pocket 1(0), Set Trap 1(0), Spellcraft 43(46), Taunt 43(56), Tumble 40(39), UMD 27(30)<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nNaked Stats<br/>\nHitpoints: 402<br/>\nSkillpoints: 312<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 21/20/20<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9<br/>\nBAB: 26<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 38 (melee), 26 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 25/36<br/>\nSpell Casting: Bard(6)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nBuffed Stats (Assuming +12 STR, +12 CON, a +5 EB scimitar, +5 AC items, and Haste)<br/>\nAB: 26 (BAB) + 14 (STR) + 4 (Feats) + 5 (EB Bonus) + 2 (Warcry) + 2 (Bard Song) = +53 (+5 Curse Song) (+6 Taunt)<br/>\nAC: 10 (Base) - 1 (DEX) + 8 (Tumble) + 2 (Feats) + 6 (PM Bonus) + 8 (Armor) + 3 (Shield) + 25 (AC Bonus) + 4 (Haste) + 1 (Mage Armor) + 5 (Bard Song) = 71 (+2 Curse Song)<br/>\nHP: 282 (Base) + 320 (CON) + 40 (Feats) = 642<br/>\nFortitude: 19 (Base) + 8 (CON) + 2 (Bard Song) = 29<br/>\nReflex: 21 (Base) - 1 (DEX) + 2 (Bard Song) = 22<br/>\nWill: 21 (Base) - 1 (WIS) + 3 (Bard Song) = 23<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi Aquarius and Yunim<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly I like your build idea. I do have a soft spot for tanky bard builds, and this is one of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt looks like this build can do quite a bit, I think either sword &amp; board or two handed would be ok, depending on whether you plan to stand and fight or aim to dish out damage rapidly. There are quite a few nice bastard swords, as you maybe have observed during our last party session, and I can see why you have chosen to go for this as a weapon focus, although in other environments scimitar might be more attractive for the crit range. I can see you have observed a few nice halberds as well.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps sword and board has a slight edge with the extra AC (up to +7 with +5 large shield, +8 with +5 tower shield)\u00a0and other magical properties provided from the shield. A sword and board PM would be hard to kill, and with WS/EWS/UMD you should be able to dish out a bit of damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like Yunim's suggestion for Bard 24/Fighter 6/PM 10 for the extra APR with BAB 26 at lvl 40, particularly if you decide to go two handed.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the build aims for 30 Str with WS/EWS combined with bard song/curse song\u00a0 the extra attack could be useful to do some extra damage, plus a two attack first flurry without having to use haste.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would recommend getting EWS at level 24, it is extremely achievable with Yunim's split and enhances playability. You could even take EWF/EWS at level 21 with a Bard 15 / Fighter 5 pre epic split with a Fighter 6 level.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see you are trying to rush lasting inspiration, and this seems reasonable to do. Perhaps you can go Bard 15 / Fighter 5 pre-epic, then hit Bard 20 around level 26 for lasting inspiration, then pump up PM to 10 for crit immunity, then take the rest of the bard levels after that?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you play this on the server (with me hopefully hehe give me those buffs thanks!) I think Yunim's suggestion extend spell would be more valuable on WoG than still spell funnily enough. In my limited experience partying with you, you do rely more on wands in combat than formally casting spells, you can always unequip armor/shield and buff yourself and teammates before battle, then use wands in combat.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you insist on casting spells during combat there are a few -% arcanist runes being dropped or sold to merchants on the server. You could socket this into a large shield or something for unimpeded spell casting during combat.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a different environment obviously still spell might be more valuable.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nMick has taught me one doesn't have to worry about arcane spell failure when using UMD with scrolls as a Bard. For casting purposes the UMD of 25 is fine, however but a UMD of 30 could be valuable, not for the reasons that Yunim has posted, but to er... equip certain boots on WoG (Valerfor taught me that one).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not too fussed about the base lvl 16 Bard Song in the environment we play in funnily enough, mostly for the +5 AC and -5 AC to enemies with curse song, extra perform is nice but will largely do add a little more hp / do little more damage with curse song and add skill points.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe you could take curse song later, when you hit either Bard 11 or Bard 14 (for -2 or -3 AC respectively)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will get a lot more skill points by taking Bard at level 1, as Yunim has observed, and I would do this and rearrange the feats such as Exotic Weapon Proficiency etc.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe open lock value point is useful for chests which cannot be opened with the knock spell, and are indestructible. We encountered such a chest in our last party session which my rogue cleric archer opened for the party. However without giving away too much of the mechanics a lot of item bonuses and modifiers are going to be required to open this chest.\u00a0Some chests when destroyed are scripted to also destroy their contents and I have also encountered this however this chest was openable with the knock spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway enough nit picking from me. I like the idea. Hope you found this helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Edit:</strong>\u00a0Oh and I'd suggest more colorful title for your build to showcase it's awesomeness.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething like '<em>The Grievous Requiem</em>' ? :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOr translate it to Latin or Ancient Greek, given the conversation going on in the Mines of Twin thread and\u00a0<em class=\"mention\">@Stagmeister</em>\u00a0others can comment on that aspect of the build :)\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n\"<em>Gravissimum requiem</em>\"<br/>\n<br/>\nOr maybe not :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I like it ;)<br/>\nthank you for your comments!<br/>\n<br/>\nProvided that the base AC is lower with 10 PM and without Armor Skin, I think I'll go with \"sword and board\" instead of the \"2-hander\" version (even if I love halberds....never mind, this will be the idea for other PCs)....<br/>\nThe idea behind the weapon was not only a preference, but also because I have already two builds with bludgeoning damage (mace + warhammer), both in WoG offline and online server, hence the choice of weapons that provide slashing/piercing damage.<br/>\nThis update retains the bastard sword, although I could opt for scimitar and replace the proficiency feat with extend spell (expertise provides that needed AC boost, and the shield does the rest).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to taunt, the potential maximum AB is increased furthermore.<br/>\nFrom level 25 this build has enough perform to sing that lv. 16 bard/curse song without relying on items /this can help freeinfg ring/bracers slot).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe split you all suggested is quite useful, as allows (in addition to the possibility to max taunts with ESF while retaining the same AB) also few HP and skills more, and 1 to fortitude save.<br/>\nI have updated only the \"sword and board\" version, however the \"halberd\" way can be surely chosen (expertise is already there, also <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with you Orion, I tend to use wands on fights so still spell is not that useful. I need only to learn the radial quickspell way/use the rod of fast buffing, to free slots for wands. \n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Sure, we can team up ;)\n</details>\n\nI would prefer retaining the ability score, in order to not to penalize AB...maximizing taunt costs the listen skill. Wands/casts of amplify will hopefully help.<br/>\nI am still unsure on how to take ESF:taunt or epic prowess at lv 39, to maintain the 40 AB.<br/>\n<br/>\nBard(24), Fighter(6), Pale Master(10),

EMA is taken at lvl 39 which is a bit late, but squeezing everything desirable in is very challenging.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nEMA (+20) combined with PM 15 (8 AC), bard song (5 AC) and tumble 40 (8AC) adds 41 AC to the build, naked. Not counting curse song.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn practice you will usually have +5 armor class or better items equipped so the AC bonus from EMA is usually +5 dodge AC and item flexibility for equipment.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it adds 26 AC total to the build naked. May as well equip that halberd now if you want to go down this route.<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually choose Epic Energy Resistance: Acid for the bonus PM 13 feat due to those pesky mages and their Mestil Acid Sheaths, WebShaman has rightly pointed out to me you should breach / mord them, although we have met an opponent where such an outcome was not erm possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis might be stronger, but keen to know what you think.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>Fighter(4), Bard(21), Pale Master(15), Human<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 16 (28)<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 14<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 15 (16)<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Bard(1): Blind Fight, Toughness<br/>\n02: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus: Halberd<br/>\n03: Bard(2): Disarm<br/>\n04: Bard(3): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n05: Bard(4)<br/>\n06: Bard(5): Improved Disarm<br/>\n07: Bard(6)<br/>\n08: Bard(7): STR+1, (STR=18)<br/>\n09: Fighter(2): Knockdown, Improved Knockdown<br/>\n10: Fighter(3)<br/>\n11: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Halberd<br/>\n12: Bard(8): STR+1, Improved Critical: Halberd, (STR=19)<br/>\n13: Bard(9)<br/>\n14: Bard(10)<br/>\n15: Bard(11): Curse Song<br/>\n16: Bard(12): CHA+1, (CHA=16)<br/>\n17: Bard(13)<br/>\n18: Bard(14): Craft Wand<br/>\n19: Bard(15)<br/>\n20: Bard(16): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n21: Bard(17): Epic Weapon Focus: Halberd<br/>\n22: Bard(18)<br/>\n23: Bard(19)<br/>\n24: Bard(20): STR+1, Lasting Inspiration, (STR=21)<br/>\n25: Pale Master(1)<br/>\n26: Pale Master(2)<br/>\n27: Pale Master(3): Epic Prowess, {Darkvision}<br/>\n28: Pale Master(4): STR+1, (STR=22)<br/>\n29: Pale Master(5)<br/>\n30: Pale Master(6): Great Strength I, (STR=23)<br/>\n31: Pale Master(7)<br/>\n32: Pale Master(8): STR+1, (STR=24)<br/>\n33: Pale Master(9): Great Strength II, (STR=25)<br/>\n34: Pale Master(10)<br/>\n35: Pale Master(11)<br/>\n36: Pale Master(12): STR+1, Great Strength III, (STR=27)<br/>\n37: Pale Master(13): Epic Energy Resistance: Acid I<br/>\n38: Pale Master(14)<br/>\n39: Pale Master(15): Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor<br/>\n40: Bard(21): STR+1, (STR=28)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 399<br/>\nSkillpoints: 263<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 21/20/20<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9<br/>\nBAB: 26<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 39 (melee), 26 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 25/36<br/>\nSpell Casting: Bard(6)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nPerform 27(30), Spellcraft 43(45), Taunt 43(46), Tumble 40(39), remaining skillpoints 110</div></blockquote><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If you are on a server that allows a reasonable rest cycle, this should be fine. You will have 19 per day until you get Inspiration, that is a lot even divided between bard and curse songs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Or is it the contrary?<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilar questions have come in my mind when reading all the replies:\n<ul>\n<li>is improved disarm generally better than expertise?</li>\n<li>to reach for undispellability or aim for epic mage armor + warding?</li>\n</ul>\n\nHaving read the thread regarding double base damage, the will to go the halberd route is much more tempting, and the build posted in #6 quite meets my needs: improved disarm, improved knockdown, etc... all feats taken, retains toughness and 30 STR.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut.....there is a but. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith such a build, I would have almost half of the slots full to reach that +20 AC that EMA gives: this means, fewer slots for ability capping (STR+CON).<br/>\nFurthermore, EMA+16 PM levels would grant +7 AC more than the designed build.<br/>\nIf I had decided to go sword and board, I would have probably chosen the Bard24.fi6.PM10 split, however for a two-hander the bard20/fighter4.PM16 is stronger, as provides more AC and frees more slots for ability capping: CON is a must, more for two-handers than sword and board fighters, as they has less AC than their fellow that equips shield.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis also answers the question I raised in post 1: is it possible to concile undispellability with PM levels?<br/>\nYes, you all would reply, but at the cost of:\n<ul>\n<li>less AC;</li>\n<li>less CON or STR --&gt; more heals used, less AB/damage; </li>\n</ul>\nTo go one-hand+sword helps mitigating these negative effects, but they will appear nonetheless.<br/>\n<br/>\nPM16 should be the way to go. Need to think some time, as I am not fully convinced.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">It depends on what you want to accomplish.  A 16 PM build w/ epic warding and epic mage armour is a strong melee build supported with bard spells but, unlike cleric, not dependent on them for survival (AC).  The majority of your AC and core immunities are undispellable making it pretty solid even with dispellable bard levels.  The bard levels offer some solid Spell convenience, especially if you can wand them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not see bard as a caster build or even an in undispellable hybrid melee build, especially not at the expense of Epic Mage Armor and secondarily Epic Warding.  All the bard undispellable spells vs Epic Mage Armour and EpicMage Armour wins in a defensive melee build every time.  Add Epic Spell Warding to this is just a cherry on top of the Epic Mage Armour ice cream.  Add to this some extra PM AC and any competition remaining drops away.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
