I have been told the Goblin Slayer is<br/>\n<br/>\n- armored<br/>\n- has high strength and constitution<br/>\n- very much focused on killing goblins<br/>\n- although I have noted there is some killing of demons and evil wizards in the Goblin Slayer Wiki page<br/>\n- is good with traps / stealth<br/>\n- is good with both melee and ranged attacks<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best way I thought to create these ideas was a Ranger 21 (for favored enemies, bane of enemies, trap setting, stealth, spot/listen etc) with Fighter for weapon/epic weapon specialization and Rogue for disable trap as a class skill, and 3d6 sneak attack.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI chose to go zen archery with the ranger , making the ranged weapon the secondary attack, and greatsword (sorry I do not know what weapon the goblin slayer uses ! going to need help here) as the main weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nSet trap is to modified 11. The ranger can cast one with the land for +4 to set trap, then set deadly traps outside of combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the extra skill points rangers get, this guy can also put points into craft trap (around 25 modified would be nice) for a 50% chance of crafting deadly traps with the right components.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway this is what the draft looks like<br/>\n<br/>\nI am seeking help with players who have played Arelith to comment as I have not seriously played Arelith at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally some comment on RP in relation to the Goblin Slayer himself as I am not familiar with him either<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course Sucy/friend to comment as well to advise what looks good and what doesn't!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>The Goblin Slayer</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRanger(21), Fighter(4), Rogue(5), Human<br/>\n<br/>\nLawful Good<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 16 (24)<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 15 (16)<br/>\nWIS: 14<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Ranger(1): Point Blank Shot, Weapon Focus: Greatsword, Favored Enemy: Goblinoids, {Dual Wield}<br/>\n02: Ranger(2)<br/>\n03: Ranger(3): Zen Archery<br/>\n04: Ranger(4): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n05: Ranger(5): Favored Enemy: Humans<br/>\n06: Ranger(6): Blind Fight<br/>\n07: Ranger(7)<br/>\n08: Ranger(8): STR+1, (STR=18)<br/>\n09: Ranger(9): Knockdown, {Improved Two-Weapon Fighting}<br/>\n10: Rogue(1)<br/>\n11: Rogue(2): {Evasion}<br/>\n12: Rogue(3): STR+1, Toughness, {Uncanny Dodge I}, (STR=19)<br/>\n13: Fighter(1): Improved Critical: Greatsword<br/>\n14: Fighter(2): Improved Knockdown<br/>\n15: Fighter(3): Iron Will<br/>\n16: Ranger(10): STR+1, Favored Enemy: Outsiders, (STR=20)<br/>\n17: Ranger(11)<br/>\n18: Ranger(12): Lightning Reflexes<br/>\n19: Ranger(13)<br/>\n20: Ranger(14): STR+1, (STR=21)<br/>\n21: Ranger(15): Great Strength I, Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword, (STR=22)<br/>\n22: Ranger(16)<br/>\n23: Rogue(4)<br/>\n24: Fighter(4): CON+1, Weapon Specialization: Greatsword, Epic Weapon Specialization: Greatsword, (CON=16)<br/>\n25: Ranger(17)<br/>\n26: Ranger(18)<br/>\n27: Ranger(19): Great Strength II, (STR=23)<br/>\n28: Ranger(20): STR+1, Epic Prowess, (STR=24)<br/>\n29: Rogue(5)<br/>\n30: Ranger(21): Bane of Enemies<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 400<br/>\nSkillpoints: 243 plus 48 skill points from rangers getting additional 2 sp / level -&gt;

I think for a sword and board w/ armor approach on a Ranger, I would likely go Archer 27 / Specialist 3 Dex build to net the archery path bonuses in lieu of the dual wielding bonus which will not be used.\u00a0 The archer path is incidental but synergies with the Dex path.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething like this Archer (27) / Specialist (3) build:\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Ranger(27), Bard(3), Human\nSTR: 16 (18 w/Gift) (26)\nCON: 16\nINT: 14 (16 w/Gift)\u00a0\n\n01: Ranger(1): Expertise, Improved Expertise, Favored Enemy I, {Rapid Reload, Rapid Shot, Point Blank Shot, Craft Ammunition: Iron}\u00a0\n03: Ranger(3): Weapon Focus\n05: Ranger(5): Favored Enemy II, {Studied Enemy I, Craft Ammunition: Steel}\n07: Ranger(7): {Woodland Stride}\n09: Ranger(9): Improved Critical, {Evasion, Called Shot}\n11: Ranger(11)\n13: Ranger(13)\n15: Ranger(15): Blind Fight, Favored Enemy IV, {Studied Enemy IV}\n17: Ranger(17)\n19: Ranger(19)\n21: Ranger(21): Epic Weapon Focus\n23: Ranger(23): Bane of Enemies\n25: Ranger(25): Epic Prowess, {Studied Enemy VII}\n27: Ranger(27): Great Strength, {Studied Enemy VII}\n29: Specialist(2)\n\nSkillpoints: 330\nBAB: 25\nAnimal Empathy 33(32), Craft Mastery 30(33), Disable Trap 1(4), Discipline 33(51), Heal 33(35), Hide 33(33), Lore 43(49), Move Silently 33(33), Open Lock 1(1), Search 4(7), Spellcraft 33(36), Spot 33(35), Tumble 30(30)\nNote: I am not 100% sure of the studied enemies slots, I believe this is accurate but I have not played a Ranger personally and I did not research and adjust the latest wiki change on it.\u00a0 I am/was an active contributor to the wiki content.\n- The spell Blade Thirst has been adjusted to 2 turns/level, +5 (at level 26 Ranger), when wielded by a ranger gets Enhancement bonus in Vampiric Regen on every hit, can be cast on ALL melee weapons\n- A Ranger can and should carry the Crafted Weapon: Elder Dream (spear, one handed on Arelith) for the spell benefits including Nature's Balance w/ Mordakainens Disjunction 1/per day, and Barkskin (12) 3/day, Sleep (2) Unlimited/day\u00a0\n- Under the new system you can select UMD for items (including wands) and/or Lore for Scrolls.\u00a0 50 Lore nets Level 7 Scrolls including Word of Faith and that is what I built for here as a Ranger you should be able to get divine wands for anything you would want in a wand anyway.\u00a0 As you can see, your Lore is 49 meaning you will need a single +1 lore on a piece of equipment to net Level 7 Scrolls.\n</details>\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_WytNTLtjepHYl-BuH13D69y52SxSxxHkr2lXHMQEvA/edit\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">COT 15 / PDK 10 / Ro 5</a> Build both COT and PDK are modified on Arelith making COT useful beyond just saves (although they are exceedingly useful) and PDK a support class that is arguably stronger than bard AND nets guard and ward features for ensuring another persons survival.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, it is worth noting that any melee build on Arelith needs Expertise and Improved Expertise, combat is balanced against having it.\u00a0 There are a few exceptions around classes designed to take hits over avoiding them but those are few.\u00a0 Even my PM/RDD/Ba has it ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>"

Not including Divine Wrath.  Ranged hits a higher mark.  Self buffed AC would need to hit 45-55 plus Expertise and Divine Shield as needed for a melee.  HP depends on a lot of things but 300 is not unreasonable.  A solid barbarian build on Arelith (massively customised class) can clear 1000 HP raging.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>"

It nets Called shot which alone is better than all the dual wield stuff (if you do not use it) and you net archery and craft ammo.  You will also see Craft Mastery 30, this is for the Arelith Dweomercraft which you will use to enchant some of your equipment and other peoples I suspect.  It needs to reach 30 to make it worthwhile.  Take Crafting as your minor gift and Tailoring as your Crafting focus.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>"

There are +4 racial and/or class limited and less desirable weapons (clubs, maces) and two +5 weapons: a gnome only crafted light hammer and a loot matrix whip.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe highest full plate armour is +3, but as the base AC drops there is +4, +5 and even two +6 AC armours.  A better way of looking at it is with Dex limit, base AC, armour enhancement, the best armour is generally +12 with the above mentioned \u201cRanger only\u201d armour coming in as the only armour in the game with +13 (Base 3, Enhancement 6, Dex 4). There are solid cloth (Base 0) armour options for Dex based builds that can exceed this of course with capped Dex builds, including another solid Ranger Only armour.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeflection is limited predominately to helm and +3 is the best outside of enhancement spells: Epic Mage Armour and Armour of Faith.<br/>\n<br/>\nNatural AC is limited to barkskin potions/wands and is +3.  Ranger only  Armor and Spear have +4 barkskin on daily use. For anyone other than Druid or Plant Domain Cleric or Ranger the effective Natural AC max is +3.  You can use shadow shield scrolls for +5 here as well but they are costly and low duration.<br/>\n<br/>\nStats are capped at +12 and with the custom item enchantment process, you can easily cap 2 stats and with some effort cap 3.  <br/>\nAnimal spells net a bonus with Greater(+1) and Epic (+2) spell focus Transmutation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many AB class enhancements. Rogues, for example net a +1 Weapon enhancement at 19 and +2 at 24 when wielding rogue proficiency weapons (other than QStaff for monk reasons) that can take their weapon enhancement to +6 with certain racial and class crafted weapons.  For the purposes of this calculation all Rogue, Assassin and ShadowDancer levels are added.  This is a weapon enhancement and is included in the does it pierce damage reduction calculation.<br/>\n<br/>\nFighters get a similar bonus, I believe it falls on level 21 and 28 for Fighter and for any weapon they hold.<br/>\n<br/>\nLarge weapons get a +2 AB (not weapon enhancement stacking) including dual weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nPDK gets several feats that increase tohit allowing some PDK builds to hit 53ish AB.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbarians get a bunch of hit/damage/AC bonuses depending on how you build them and the various Rage systems are completely changed, much cooler and are under cooldown now.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany feats have been changed from uses per day to a cool down period including: Divine Wrath, Blinding Speed (this lets a 24 roguish level Rogue/SD/Assassin be hasted for 3 turns with a 4 turn cooldown meaning 75% innate haste on a world with no haste items), Shadow Evade (A 17 ShadowDancer has 100% mechanical uptime on Shadow Evade), etc ...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe baseline exceptional melee with no feat buffs or spell buffs:<br/>\nBAB: 25<br/>\nBase Stat: 10 (30 Str/Dex)<br/>\nStat Capped: 6<br/>\nWF: 1<br/>\nEWF: 2<br/>\nEP: 1<br/>\nWeapon Enhancement: 3<br/>\n<br/>\nTotal: 48<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd a small race WM with a scimitar (large weapon for a small race) and you are at 52.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Travel/War Healer (Cleric subclass) 27 / Monk 3 HOrc QStaff (Monk UBAB) build looks something like this from memory:<br/>\n<br/>\nBAB: 20<br/>\nBase Stat: 7<br/>\nCapped: 6<br/>\nWF: 1<br/>\nEWF: 2<br/>\nLarge Weapon: 2<br/>\nDivine Power: 5<br/>\nGreater Magic Weapon: 5<br/>\nBless: 1<br/>\nAid: 1<br/>\nPrayer: 1<br/>\nBattletide: 2<br/>\n<br/>\nTotal: 53<br/>\n<br/>\nHP: 600 (using regen and overheal, a healer thing)<br/>\nAC: 53 (63 with IE) ish<br/>\n<br/>\nCapped: Str/Dex/Con/Wis w/ ESF:Transmutation Animal spells and Turns/Level AOV and Regeneration.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, all the weapon buff spells do not stack (with few exceptions: Divine Favour,  Bless Weapon, BlackStaff, Holy Sword, deafening Clang, Blade Thirst ... but never on attack, just damage).  No Darkfire, Flame Weapon or Keen edge on anything other than a mundane weapon with no other enchantments :(<br/>\n<br/>\nAND HOrc nets Ambidexterity as an added Racial feat making it the two handed weapon racial build frame of choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a very complex and interesting place to build for ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>"

If it\u2019s not a hassle, would it be possible to slip in a few fighter levels for a ranger fighter specialist? I think it would lose the +5 blood thirst and a couple favored/studied enemies though. I\u2019ll run all three builds by my friend after classes today if you decide to and let him choose which he would prefer. Thanks again everyone!</div>"

The main reason for fighter would be for heavy armor and extra feats for cleave, both rp related and part of the character in the novel.

However, summons are strong well into the endgame content, so caster tend to be summoners and focus on saveless damage severely limiting offensive spell options.<br/>\n<br/>\nA protection healer focuses on a defensive casting approach where you summon/buff and heal and is exceedingly good at it.
