      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">I've developed a fondness for party friendly builds recently.<br/>\n<br/>\nBard / Fighter / Rogue isn't a particularly well investigated combination with only 5 such builds in the ECB archives and one of Max's builds in our forum.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is great for parties, and noted builders such as Mithdradates,\u00a0 Grimnir77 and Maximillan Kane have utilised this class combination previously.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe concept of avoiding / minimising multi-class experience penalties by setting the favored class low also hasn't been thoroughly investigated either.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only build I've found so far that has utilised this concept is\u00a0found Grimnir77's Bloodaxe the DEXtrous (Rogue 18/Fighter 6/Bard 16).<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe you ladies and gentlemen know of some more builds who use this concept too?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I've been working on a halfling Bard / Fighter / Rogue build.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI've called it Life of the Party, because it brings a lot to any party:<br/>\n<br/>\n- tank damage with 400+hp, high dex AC, evasion, equip a large shield for extra AC when needed<br/>\n- do damage with 42 base AB, ITWF kukri, 4d6 sneak attack with 6-7 APR, WS/EWS<br/>\n- detect enemies with the spot skill (listen is an alternative)<br/>\n- disable opponents with improved knockdown, preventing them from going to the back lines<br/>\n- buff teammates or yourself with bard song, improved invisibility, haste, keen weapon, cat's grace/bull's strength, mage armor, protection from evil etc...<br/>\n- reduce enemy's AC with both curse song and taunt (-5 + -6 = up to -11 AC)<br/>\n- disable lots of traps, set deadly traps, open some locks, UMD, some search as well<br/>\n- no multiclass exp penalties<br/>\n- ranged attack isn't bad either, at 40 base AB + sneak attack/bard song damage, which could be situationally useful if you don't actually want to tank for whatever reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway am keen for some suggestions to improve the build further, it looks like a nice one to me, and a fun one too.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nBardic progression looks a little slow (sometimes you want all the good stuff, now!) but not sure what I can do to improve that, aside from dropping fighter for CoT<br/>\n<br/>\nWoG players will also probably want craft wand in this build likely at level 24 when they obtain level 4 bard spells and improved invisibility with all the dispel and Mord spamming going on. Probably reasonable to drop toughness for this, but if you got a mage to make you wands you're laughing.<br/>\n<br/>\nLingering song would have also been nice too.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Rogue(7), Fighter(16), Bard(17), Halfling\nSTR: 10\nCON: 14\nINT: 14\n\n01: Rogue(1): Two-Weapon Fighting\n03: Fighter(2): Weapon Proficiency Exotic, Ambidexterity\n05: Bard(2)\n07: Rogue(2): {Evasion}\n09: Bard(4): Blind Fight\n11: Fighter(5)\n13: Bard(5)\n15: Fighter(6): Knockdown, Improved Knockdown\n17: Bard(7)\n19: Fighter(8): Improved Critical: Kukri\n21: Rogue(4): Epic Weapon Focus: Kukri\n23: Fighter(10): Epic Weapon Specialization: Kukri\n25: Bard(11)\n27: Rogue(5): Great Dexterity I, (DEX=24)\n29: Bard(12)\n31: Fighter(13)\n33: Fighter(14): Great Dexterity III, Armor Skin, (DEX=26)\n35: Bard(15)\n37: Bard(16)\n39: Rogue(7): Great Dexterity V, (DEX=29)\n\nSkillpoints: 266\nSaving Throw bonuses: Traps: +1, Fear: +2\nAB (max, naked): 42 (melee), 40 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Bard(6)\n\n\n01: Disable Trap(4), Open Lock(1), Search(4), Set Trap(4), Spot(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(15),\u00a0\n03: Discipline(1), Save(17),\u00a0\n05: Discipline(1), Perform(3), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(7),\u00a0\n07: Disable Trap(5), Set Trap(1), Spot(6), Tumble(2), UMD(2), Save(4),\u00a0\n09: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(2),\u00a0\n11: Discipline(1), Save(8),\u00a0\n13: Discipline(2), Taunt(4), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n15: Discipline(1), Save(3),\u00a0\n17: Discipline(1), Taunt(3), Tumble(3), UMD(4), Save(1),\u00a0\n19: Discipline(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n21: Disable Trap(9), Spot(5), UMD(3),\u00a0\n23: Discipline(2), Save(2),\u00a0\n25: Discipline(1), Perform(3), Taunt(1), Save(3),\u00a0\n27: Disable Trap(3), Search(1), Spot(7), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n29: Discipline(1), Taunt(5), Save(2),\u00a0\n31: Discipline(1), Save(9),\u00a0\n33: Discipline(2), Save(8),\u00a0\n35: Discipline(1), Perform(3), Taunt(2), Save(6),\u00a0\n37: Discipline(1), Perform(6), Taunt(3), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n39: Spot(9), Save(4),\u00a0</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">A bard that works also as a rogue and a seasoned fighter. Great!<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapon specialization helps a lot in doing damage, especially in bard/PM or dex bards, as bards don't have darkfire or flame weapon.<br/>\nGoing DEX helps also getting rid of that still spell feat, that is almost a must jn STR bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to take craft wand or lingering song (great addition if lasting inspiration cannot be obtained), in my humble opinion you can swap kukri for shortsword or dagger, that are available from rogue and can be dual wielded also by little ones (although they don't have the same critical range as kukris), so weap. prof exotic will not be needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: this may be the idea for the next team, as the current one is quickly ending its quests....or not? ;)<br/>\nI have already an idea on what should I play: half orc fighter.bard.RDD!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
