The obvious loss is UMD.\u00a0 It really feels like a different character at that point, and it's merely a change of two levels.\u00a0 Interesting....<br/>\n<br/>\nDruids are surprisingly easy to level up pre-epics, and I don't think this guy would be an exception.\u00a0 The trouble, at least for me, was Druids in Epics.\u00a0 That's not fault of your build, but a fault in the class in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for sharing, Orion.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks for your message and reading my build GDL. This is kind of an experimental build I've never tried before, and it arose mostly from my frustrations playing the Druid class. <br/>\n<br/>\nDruids are really powerful but have less spell casts per day than their cleric comrades probably because Druids get polymorphs and an animal companion to compensate. The disables are simply fabulous. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the troubles was polymorphing all the time got tedious and one can't cast spells while polymorphed and there are limits on the number of morphs / day except at High levels where the polymorphs fall off and struggle to hit things when I attempted a run through Rarys fortress. It was pretty much Dragon Shape spam most of the way, which with only 3 casts / day meant I was casting through those Leomunds much more than some of my other builds. Sometimes I could hit things in water elemental form but my opponents would have to have a grease spell and lying on the floor for me to hit em<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to create something that can take advantage of the SoV/Stonehold/Grease/Entangle combo whilst giving them a solid Thwacking. There's a couple of no DC spells like Harm and Creeping Doom which are pretty sweet. Harm benefits from high AB being a touch attack. Anyway I'm curious as to what this build might look like with Devastating Critical which I might look into when I finish up at work today. Also would be good to look at the DCs for Grease Stonehold and SoV for the build when buffed with Owls Insight.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yes I went Rogue over Monk. I wanted to be clad in some solid armor and shield and scimitar whilst hitting plus UMD as you stated, is just such a powerful ability.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Did max discipline because quite a few players want to have that skill at least for some knockdown/disarm/called shot resistance, but it could be dropped for extra disable trap / craft trap / heal / lore. Listen could also be dumped for those skills as Druid has a True Sight spell but in the environment I play in True Sight is nerfed.
