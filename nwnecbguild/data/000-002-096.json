      "content": "<div>Hi all<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is the best character at \"fishing for 20s\" in melee fights? Say an endgame boss has 200 AC (even when flat-footed) and is spell immune. She also dwells in a very tight room where you can't snipe her or set up traps. How do you build your level 40 character in order to defeat her? It should be somewhat playable 1-40 and retain honest AC and/or HP, as the boss will also try to hit you. Let's say +5 environment.\u00a0<br/>\nI can think of several ways to boost your average damage output on lucky 20s, but what's the most effective combination?\n<ul>\n<li>Improved Power Attack</li>\n<li>EWS</li>\n<li>Buffs (GMW, Divine Favor, Flame Weapon etc)</li>\n<li>High STR (RDD? Dragon Shape?)</li>\n<li>Many attacks (twin kama Monk? Flurry does not work with IPA I think)</li>\n<li>Sneak attacks (you can have at most 4/round, correct?)</li>\n<li>Ranger feats</li>\n<li>Divine Might</li>\n<li>Using a two-handed weapon</li>\n<li>Bard song</li>\n<li>Divine Wrath</li>\n</ul>\nI probably forgot several things. Remember, AB is irrelevant, so one can be creative. Like two bastard swords with no need to take Ambidexterity.<br/>\nWhat would you do?</div>"

      "content": "<div>Some of the more extreme min-maxed DPS builds I've made sacrifice Blind Fight for more damage. If your target has concealment then the extra damage probably isn't worth dropping Blind Fight. The Rang23/Cler16/Monk1 can fit in Blind Fight since it doesn't need IC: Kama, but other min-maxed builds might not have enough feats to spare.<br/>\n<br/>\nDI/DR mainly affects weapon choice and the amount of unblockable damage that you should aim for. If the boss has 50% Pie DI and 50% Sla DI but no Blu DI then a 9 APR kama build might be outdamaged by a 7 APR dire mace build. If the boss has 50% DI to all damage types then going CHA focused with Divine Might is probably better than going STR focused for more physical damage.</div>"

CoT bonus feats can be used in epics to get Great Wisdoms, which means the stat requirements to cast 4th level spells could be met that way, allowing you to pump STR and CHA up by a bunch. Perhaps Paladin 16 / Monk 6 / CoT 18 would work, but I'd have to test it. I don't know if it'd do more damage than Yunim's suggested build (probably not, since he's the math genius in the house), but it would be high up there, for sure! Paladins have Deafening Clang and Holy Sword, as well as all the Cleric damage buffs, so they do considerably more damage, not to mention Smite Evil!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!</div>",

Unless you're talking about a really gimped Cleric with low Wisdom. A Paladin will only need 14 WIS, which would theoretically mean they can get a higher STR for normal damage or CHA for Divine damage. I'm not sure which one would outdo the other. Also, are we assuming there are no DR/DIs for the purposes of this discussion?</div>",

So the Cleric version would still do the most damage since it's 1d6 +11 vs 1d6 +4. If the mob had lower (but still high) AC then things might be different, since Darkfire isn't affected by critical hits and so Holy Sword could potentially out-damage Darkfire. However for this specific mob the cleric version is better, since critical hits don't matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout knowing what the DI/DR actually is there's no way to adjust for them so it's best to just assume the mob doesn't have any.
