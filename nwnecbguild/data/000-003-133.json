      "content": "<div><span style=\"color:TRANSPARENT\">So I have been getting the itch to make a new character again, and I was looking through the builds forum when I came across the Arelith Necro-enchanter build. However, some things about the build struck me as odd and I decided to tailor it more to a particular character concept that I'm working on. A lot of the build is unchanged save for the race and some of the feats and the order in which they are taken. I changed the race to Human to get the additional feat and class skill so I could work Heal into it. I also altered the order of the feats because of the changes to feats on Arelith (listed here: </span><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Feat_changes\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#105289\">http://wiki.arelith.com/Feat_changes</span></a><span style=\"color:TRANSPARENT\">). You get more benefit from taking the other Spell Focuses earlier than Necromancy and I swapped Still Spell for Craft Wand because I can't imagine a situation where I'll need to Still Spell cast anything. Anyways, posting here for feedback and to make sure I'm not missing something.</span>\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:TRANSPARENT\">Wizard(23), Pale Master(4), Rogue(3), any non-good

      "content": "<div>I wasn't around to comment on the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2334723/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span style=\"color:#0000FF\">original necro build</span></strong></a> that Max posted but I like the higher CON over any STR since STR is a non sequitur for a pure caster (BTW, always post a link to any/all similar builds when offering your own variant for inspection).\u00a0 The link to Arelith's custom changes is only helpful for those of us non-Arelith members with time to browse the website hunting for what may apply to each build. It is more prudent to furnish the information that could affect your design concept DIRECTLY in the topic or link to that information in the ECB PW section if someone had the foresight to place it there already.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'd still use the gifting plan you've proposed to raise CON 16 to 18 (as Max had suggested).\u00a0 This is a necro rather than a dedicated artillery caster so will be getting flanked a lot while attempting touch attacks and any Fort is welcome. That will allow you to drop the lame Toughness feat for Spell Pen and drop Maximize for Greater Spell Pen which is the build's key weakness (PM levels don't help vs. SR so GSP compensates for those 4 levels).\u00a0 Empowered IGMS has more damage potential than maximized anyway\u00a0 (as is the case for all offensive spells using dice rolls).<br/>\n \u00a0<br/>\n I agree with Max's choosing gnome for the extra AC, stealth and detection advantages, but human works fairly well and I assume there must be value in the Heal skill else you would not have sacrificed the obvious racial benefits.\u00a0 The extra feat merely allows you to craft wands which can be very handy, though not essential unless resting is severely restricted on long solo crawls. I use it a lot in my own caster builds if it doesn't cost optimization in another aspect of the build's potential.<br/>\n<br/>\n Mark your alignment bias requirements in the initial stats, please.\u00a0 This build would be \"any non-good Human\" with the PM levels, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n The only question I have is: in a build like this focused on AC, why no EMA?\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n I would have asked Max the same question on his version. Even with +5 AC items/buffs aplenty, the +5 Dodge AC still stacks and EMA cannot be interrupted or dispelled. The duration is longer than the dragon knight by far and you already have the epic mummy and elder elementals to tank.\u00a0 Curious.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks for posting a detailed skill schedule in your preliminary version. <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/11.gif\"/><br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>I should have stated in the initial post that I am sacrificing some build optimization for RP flavor. This refers mostly to the racial choice and the Dragon Knight. I updated the original post with the alignment bias.<br/>\n<br/>\n I am planning to take advantage of the Necromancy Changes on Arelith that I am listing here:<br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:120%;line-height:normal\">Spell Focus: Necromancy</span> <ul><li>Greater Spell Focus: Necromancy turns Summoned Undead (from any Spell, Class Ability or Feat) into Henchmen. Your character may therefore have two undead minions at the same time. Note that the undeads\u00a0<strong>must</strong>\u00a0be summoned from different sources; casting two times Create Undead will not result in two minions.</li> <li>Epic Spell Focus: Necromancy will allow the caster to have three summoned undead at the same time.</li> </ul><span style=\"font-size:120%;line-height:normal\">Undead Summoning</span><br/>\n Necromancy summoning has been completely overhauled to work unlike any other summoning in the game.<br/>\n Undead summoning spells no longer summon a specific creature tied to that spell, instead, all of these spells will summon creatures of power directly tied to a secondary undead caster level, henceforth UCL. <ul><li>The UCL is either your full cleric levels,\u00a0<strong>or</strong>\u00a0your added total of wizard, sorcerer and pale master levels.</li> <li>Once taking the feat Mummy Dust, all undead will be tier 4, not just those summoned by Mummy Dust. By itself, Mummy Dust does not summon any special creature, but will act exactly like any other undead summoning spell.</li> <li>The minions must be summoned from different spells; casting Animate Twice twice won't net you a second minion.</li> </ul>\n<br/>\n 1. With regards to CON, I was planning on getting the stats to match those listed by Max in the original post, but with Human I was unable to get to 16 CON before gifts. At most I could get 15 at which point I decided to drop it down to 14 and put points into STR to get just a bit more carrying weight as a quality of life change.<br/>\n<br/>\n 2. I took Toughness because I wasn't sure what else to take, but I like your idea of dropping it and Maximise for Spell Pen and Greater Spell Pen respectively so I'll update that when I get home.<br/>\n<br/>\n 3. The Heal Skill directly translates into survivability because it affects Healer's Kits which is the primary way for you to heal yourself on Arelith. Also as stated above, I am sacrificing some build optimization for RP flavor here.<br/>\n<br/>\n 4. Craft Wand is a useful feat not only for the reasons you listed, and on Arelith there is a market around them so it's also a good way to make some money.<br/>\n<br/>\n 5. I chose the Mummy Dust to get the final Tier of Undead Summons as shown above as well as to be able to summon three undead at once. Dragon Knight is less optimal, but on Arelith characters with Pale Master get to summon a Dracolich so this is another situation where sacrifices are made for RP flavor.</div>"
