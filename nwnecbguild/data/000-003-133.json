      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi there. I can have a go at the simple stuff if you like - I'll leave the more in-depth analysis to those better qualified.<br/>\n<br/>\n First of all, you don't seem to have a class for level 7, but to be fair, nor do you have a WM level 11. My guess would be WM 1 at level 7, as that's the first time WM becomes available, but I may be wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm not sure, but I think you need EWF before you can take EWS, so I'd either move WM to level 21 for EWF, or possibly better, take Fighter 7 and 8 together at level 21 and 22 so you can have EWF at 21 and EWS at 22. This would also free up a WM bonus feat - maybe for Epic Superior WF?<br/>\n<br/>\n Secondly, as currently listed, you're taking 2 feats at level 21 - on an odd-numbered Fighter level. Either Great Strength I goes or EWS does (but see above). Of course, if the empty level 7 slot was meant for Fighter 7 you'd be alright.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, I'm not sure why you included the skills allocation at level 17?<br/>\n<br/>\n At the moment it seems it's the organizational element that's knackering things up for you. Sorting that out should help, I hope. <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If you dual-wield katanas, you will have an extra -2 AB penalty for using a non-small or tiny weapon in your off-hand, and not having Ambidexterity will hurt you AB in the off-hand attack, and the lack of Improved Two Weapon Fighting means that you will be taking all these penalties to gain only one extra attack. You would get a total of -4 AB on your main hand and -8 AB on your off hand. You would be much better off going sword-and-board and taking another feat, like Toughness.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, a shield will hurt your stealth, but why do you need stealth anyway?

I can only reiterate Empyre's comments, and suggest that maybe Knockdown might be more valuable to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, just a few questions. Would I be right in assuming you want so much CON so you can take EDR 1 at level 29? It just seems a sizeable investment when you consider the impact it has on lowering your AB and damage. Secondly, I haven't worked out your saves, do you know what they come to? I ask only because I fear for your Will save - even with Iron Will. Third, do you get a bonus 2 points in STR somewhere, because I can only make it add up to 26? Finally, what does your skills schedule look like - just overall figures?<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That's not heavy-duty stealth, but at least you'd get some use out of HiPS occasionally.<br/>\n<br/>\n I also understand the kewlness factor of your TWF choice.\u00a0 Many players like to see the dual-katana animation which is fine.\u00a0 It still comes down to having fun playing the character so if that adds to your enjoyment, go for it.\u00a0 But understand that the TWF feat by itself won't really be helping enough to spend a slot on it. You'll still be missing against any challenging creature A LOT and forget about any thought of DWing in PvP.\u00a0 I suggest just dual-wielding when you want, suffer the combat penalties, and when it seems you can't hit a barn door, switch back to the s/s configuration.\u00a0 In other words, eliminate TWF for a more useful combat option (like KD) that will work well with s/s.<br/>\n<br/>\n With all that said, I think you are trying to do too much with all those SD levels staring you in the face.\u00a0 If getting the clone is important, that's also fine.\u00a0 But trying to satisfy WM prereqs, establish an effective AB and reach EDR is a bit much.\u00a0 With more fighter levels, sure, you'd be in a better position, but your choices have pinched you.\u00a0 WM 19 is usually the same milestone I reach for to avoid the lame Epic Toughness WM gets forced into with more bonus feats.\u00a0 But with more fighter levels, you could extend both your AB and damage with general feats and still develop your full combat potential (EWF/EWS/Prowess/ArmorSkin).\u00a0 Just pointing out that your diversification is costing you combat optimization.\u00a0\u00a0 We won't consider how abysmal your AC will be since it appears you are depending on a large HP pool and minor EDR to help deal with incoming damage.\u00a0 Those 15 rounds per day using Shadow Evade will fly by like a blink.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Yeah, with STR builds it is tough not to get hit.\u00a0 I noticed you tried to use PM to reach high AC in another build, but even that is limited and countered (usually) by your toon's bad AB so you don't get hit as much but you also don't hit back reliably either.<br/>\n<br/>\n But there are ways to counter destructive, opposed attacks for STR-focus beyond huge HP and EDR.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n We're considering a non-caster in this case, and one of the most common methods is using rogue for UMD to use scrolls of ImpInvis.\u00a0 Assassin is another and even gets a feat-based version to use besides the UMD benefits.\u00a0 An opponent's Blind Fight can negate some of the concealment benefits, but 50% concealment really helps, even for only a few turns per scroll.\u00a0 Both those classes work well with stealth because you can dump to skills regularly without needing to invest too many levels to achieve a good skill set.\u00a0 Monk's Empty Body concealment is another option but that only provides about 4 turns each day and requires at least monk 18 to gain access to it.\u00a0 So scrolls are really more economical, class-investment-wise, if available.\u00a0 Even when effects get dispelled, just read another.\u00a0 With a big enough stack, you'll expend all the dispeller's slots.... eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\n The problem with investing so many levels to get the Epic Shadowlord is that at SD 13 it is the bottom-of-the-barrel version with only 132 HP and none of the combat feats that make it a really influential ally.\u00a0\u00a0 Perhaps your server has modified the low-end epic summon to have better stats?\u00a0 Let's hope so, since you are depending so heavily in its effectiveness. By default, its only offensive threat is the touch attack that bypasses AC but its standard attack is lame (i.e. +16/+11/+6).<br/>\n<br/>\n In comparison, an elder water elemental (for example) is 228 HP, has most of the same immunities of the shadowlord (sneaks, crits, mind, etc.), can be recast as often as the number of scrolls you have in inventory of a UMD-user and attacks at +26/+21/+16 with much more damage.\u00a0 You can also buff it via ImpInvis scrolls (or any other scrolls, for that matter) to make up for the concealment it lacks compared to the SD summon.\u00a0 So, there are ways to achieve nearly the same level of support without needing to invest so heavily in SD or really any tumble class.\u00a0 Without being able to take full advantage of HiPS I think you are fighting yourself from a build's perspective going the SD route.<br/>\n<br/>\n But you are probably right about needing a huge HP pool in legendary environments.\u00a0 They usually design encounters that bypass typical toon combat levels so you'll be chugging pots and using heal kits a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n BTW, David... you may very well have described aspects of your server in another request but don't rely on us (actually... ME!) remembering all that.\u00a0 There are too many different servers played by too many requestors to keep track of them.\u00a0 If you have been playing the same place for a while and plan to continue, perhaps it would be in all our best interests to start a topic in the<strong> <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/forums/60569/Persistent-World\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#0000FF\">Persistent Worlds</span></a> </strong>section.\u00a0 Check some of the PW topics already posted to see the sort of information that an author/player reveals.\u00a0 Disclose any information you have now and add to it as new facts become available to you.\u00a0 Don't worry so much about spelling or grammar.\u00a0 The bare facts are what is most relevant.\u00a0 Then each time you request a new build intended to be played there, just furnish the link back to it up front. We'll be able to click that first to get a heads-up as to how each new build needs to comply to best serve your needs.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
