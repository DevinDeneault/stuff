I played a PM to level 38 a long time ago and I don't remember.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is: like Toughness, does it also appear at level up? Meaning, if I'm trying to roll max HP, do I need to include them or do they get applied afterwards?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I wonder if you could send the game into meltdown if you take a PM level and Toughness as a feat at the same level - even more so if you get a CON boost at the same time!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
