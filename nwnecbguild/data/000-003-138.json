      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I do not think I can help you with a build, but I can hopefully give you an opinion a bit higher (with the warlocks, from my own personal experience with them). Fey, is mostly for parties, the buffs and such. With unlimited casting, it's a good thing. Daze if you stay a warlock would do roughly 80 damage at 20 and 120 at 30 (Maximum as it is a 1d4 * Warlock Levels). Note that the DC of the spell will rise with your levels in Warlock (Bard). Please note that Summon I summons the equivalent of a Summon Creature III which is the Worg of you which you speak\u00a0 (The Underdark version of the Surface level 3). Conjuration, Greater Conjuration, and Epic. Let's a Level 1 summon spell reach Level's 2, 3, and 4 Respectively. (Unknown if Conjuration affects Warlock as I never took it. So, ...use at own risk?) A disadvantage is that you are limited to only the spells you see within the list. You cannot use 'anything' you want. It is all pretty much determined.<br/>\n<br/>\n Though, Tasha's laughter gets...really overpowered in my personal opinion (making super hard things at low levels become child's play.)<br/>\n<br/>\n A good place to stop on Warlock levels (if you want other classes) Should not really be before level 20 at most, so that you get the maximum amount of effectiveness. However, it can really be cast aside any time you want, though I would highly recommend 20 levels at least, regardless, of choosing order.. (Especially for the Fey path). Fey is more Support. Abyssal/Fiend is more 'offensive'. Each has its own unique strengths and weaknesses. But, both sides are highly viable. I will let the experts, however, give you a proper build. (As they might know how to meld it better with other classes instead of straight up pure warlock.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It's definitely quite feasible. Anything except PDK is pretty much accessible, so long as it doesn't require a alignment change. For your future use.
