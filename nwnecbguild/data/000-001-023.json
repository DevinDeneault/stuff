      "content": "<div>This list evolved from a discussion about melee range I had been following.\u00a0 The numbers are relative ones and should not be construed as meaning meters (though it may very well be used that way somehow). For instance, what is realized on-screen is dependent on the creature size of attacker vs. creature size of defender with the same weapon.\u00a0 I'm certain most of you have noticed the disparity yourselves, so I'll leave it to the custom content designers within our audience to try to quantify how the game implements these figures.\u00a0 Nonetheless, I find them, in some cases pretty much as anticipated, and yet in others, a total surprise.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n As far as building toons goes, if you are ever undecided which might suit your weapon of choice best, this information may help.\u00a0 For example, if you planned to attack from behind a party tank, you might prefer a weapon with the longest range, like halberd or dire mace.\u00a0 The same relationship would apply for defending against enemies equipping different weapons.\u00a0 Keep in mind, though, that feat dynamics, like circle kick distance or implementation of game conventions like the distance to trigger attacks of opportunity will use these values as part of the in-game calculation.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, notice that all ranged weapons have the same attack distance, but is still proportional to melee weapons (i.e. attack distance of all ranged is 30 times that of an unarmed attack).<table class=\"post_content_table\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Weapon<br/>\n --------------------------------</strong></td><td><strong>Attack Distance<br/>\n --------------------------</strong></td></tr><tr><td>unarmed<br/>\n club<br/>\n dagger<br/>\n handaxe<br/>\n kama<br/>\n light hammer<br/>\n sickle<br/>\n battleaxe<br/>\n dwarven waraxe<br/>\n kukri<br/>\n light mace<br/>\n shortsword<br/>\n warhammer<br/>\n katana<br/>\n scimitar<br/>\n greataxe<br/>\n lance<br/>\n light flail<br/>\n morningstar<br/>\n rapier<br/>\n spear<br/>\n trident<br/>\n double axe<br/>\n heavy flail<br/>\n longsword<br/>\n scythe<br/>\n two-bladed sword<br/>\n bastard sword<br/>\n magic staff<br/>\n quarterstaff<br/>\n halberd<br/>\n whip<br/>\n greatsword<br/>\n dire mace<br/>\n dart<br/>\n heavy crossbow<br/>\n light crossbow<br/>\n longbow<br/>\n shortbow<br/>\n shuriken<br/>\n sling<br/>\n throwing axe</td><td>1.0<br/>\n 1.1<br/>\n 1.1<br/>\n 1.1<br/>\n 1.1<br/>\n 1.1<br/>\n 1.1<br/>\n 1.2<br/>\n 1.2<br/>\n 1.2<br/>\n 1.2<br/>\n 1.2<br/>\n 1.2<br/>\n 1.3<br/>\n 1.3<br/>\n 1.4<br/>\n 1.4<br/>\n 1.4<br/>\n 1.4<br/>\n 1.4<br/>\n 1.4<br/>\n 1.4<br/>\n 1.5<br/>\n 1.5<br/>\n 1.5<br/>\n 1.5<br/>\n 1.5<br/>\n 1.6<br/>\n 1.6<br/>\n 1.6<br/>\n 1.7<br/>\n 1.7<br/>\n 1.8<br/>\n 2.0<br/>\n 30.0<br/>\n 30.0<br/>\n 30.0<br/>\n 30.0<br/>\n 30.0<br/>\n 30.0<br/>\n 30.0<br/>\n 30.0</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n \u00a0</div>"
