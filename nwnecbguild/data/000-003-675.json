It is further weakened by dual wielding kamas (-2 AB) and using flurry of blows (-2 AB).\u00a0<br/>\nDruids can cap strength easily (Bull's Strength, Blood Frenzy, Aura of Vitality) for +6 AB but even still the AB is going to be a struggle. Other classes such as clerics, and bards can boost the effective AB even further than a druid can. Unfortunately I do not see a lot of solutions apart from dropping Dragon Shape and investing stats into Str (or Dex + Weapon Finesse) to boost AB up that way.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the flipside, in Dragon Shape your AB should be good enough with BAB 26 + druid buffs, as long as your buffs are not dispelled.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding dragon shape -&gt; once you polymorph (into a dragon for example) would it be fair to say you can no longer dual wield on Arkhalia? Or has this been modified?<br/>\n<br/>\nA Monk 4 / Ranger 8 / Druid 8 split would net you +1 AB, you can then get improved knockdown at level 22.<br/>\nWith a high Wis score, your grease spells can provide an AoE knockdown which you are immune to.<br/>\n<br/>\nPre-epic feats I would swap improved critical: heavy flail to improved critical: unarmed. This is because creature weapons use Improved Critical but not Weapon foci.<br/>\nEpic feats I would try to fit epic prowess, which polymorphs (creature weapons) will use. Epic Weapon Focus: Kama might be useful if you want to have a useful kama attack. Unfortunately as discussed WF: Unarmed and EWF: Unarmed do not transfer to polymorphs<br/>\nOne could drop Int slightly and increase cons if you find you have too many skill points.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway hope thats helpful.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If WF/EWF doesn't work while shifted on your server then the epic feats for both builds are Armor Skin, Dragon Shape, Epic Prowess, and G WIS 6. This can easily be changed to include EWF for both builds, although it might mean delaying Dragon Shape.\u00a0The Figh variant can also get both WS and EWS if that works while shifted.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

So I am improved critical unarmed strike and weapon focus unarmed strike.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe improved critical heavy flail thing was when I clicked on improved critical in CBC, I just clicked a random improved critical. I just didnt want to take the time to find the improved critical unarmed strike option.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo not dual wielding Kama's. Unarmed strike fist count as 2 weapons right? If so, then doing 2 weapon fighting with fist.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that cant be done, then I'll use Kama's for 2 weapon fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the low AB, I was going to use the earlier forms like Bear: 28 to 38 str, and buffs, and summons, and spells and good play to get by, around that, and maybe using a party, or doing the easier PW's, or the easier official campaign modules.<br/>\n<br/>\nYunim, what would you substitute for Power Attack, Great Cleave.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the help, suggestions Orion, Yunim, I will either do or try to do most to almost all those suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like the concept of having lots of animal companions, lots of animals, monsters I can summon, being able to change into various animals, monsters, shapes, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that shifter would probably be better then this, but I would lose out on the Ranger extra animal companion, better BAB schedule, better D10 hp, 2 weapon path.<br/>\n<br/>\nI could do the Monk/Druid/Shifter, and just take use feat slots to get the 2 weapon feats, but I would lose out even more with, on the AB, and lose the extra animal companion, and only have 1 animal companion, instead of 2 animal companions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought I read, saw, that if you were a monk, that your monk unarmed attacks, AC, etc, became part of your dragon form, and that that was why Monk/Druid/Shifter/Dragon Form was good.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid I mishear, misread, misunderstand that?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso even tho some good advice from Yunim, Orion, is there anybody here that is a expert builder of Dragon Shape toons that could help here?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the help.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

And 2 weapon fighting, lots of attacks doesnt seem to game mechanically within the rules, doesnt seem to mesh well with dragon shape.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo because of that, I wilp go with Monk/Druid/Shifter, with either a Monk 6/Druid 18/Shifter 16(INFINITE Greater Wild Shape 4, Dire Tiger, Medusa, Illithid Mind Flayer), and can use either a epic feat, or bonus feat for Dragon Shape<br/>\n<br/>\nOr Monk 6/Druid 24(Near undispellable spells, and near maxed out spellcasting)/Shifter 10(Dragon Shape)<br/>\n<br/>\nPre Epic for both possibilities would be either Monk 6/Druid 6/Shifter 8,  or Monk 4/Druid 8/Shifter 8.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I go with Str 10/12, and bump base starting wis to 17,18, then I can take Dragon Shape by Level 30, instead of lev 33, by going Great Wis at levels 21, 24,27(30 Wis), then take Dragon Shape feat at 30th level, instead of lev 33 to 36.<br/>\n<br/>\nImproved Expertise and Zen Archery, sounds good. If I take it tho, should I also take point blank shot?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso there is a LOT of Magic Weapons, up to +8 on Arkhalia. But I havent seen a lot of +8, etc, high magic bows or Crossbows, and havent seen a lot of +8, etc, arrows, +8, etc, bolts, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a LOT of +1 to +8 melee weapons tho.<br/>\n<br/>\nRanged Weapons, high +1 to +8, magic weapons, and the fact that I could transform to a 27 str Brown bear by 7th level by going Monk 2/Druid 5, would make a lower AB, work ok, just fine, until I get better forms, a dragon<br/>\n<br/>\nSo which split would you advise Monk 6/Druid 18/Shifter 16 or Monk 6/Druid 24/Shifter 10 or some other split? Which?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Stats:<br/>\n<br/>\nStr 10,  Dex 14, Con 8, Wis 18, Cha 8.<br/>\n<br/>\nWent with this because dont want Str at 8, because that make it hard to even deal damage when hit in melee. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd need a 14 dex, 12 not enough. And the bear form that get at lev 6, gives you about a 19, 20 con.<br/>\n<br/>\nWent with either  Point blank shot, or WF Heavy Crossbow, to go with Zen Archery.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnimal Companion, Summons in early levels Kill EVERYTHING for you, and later on help give you time to take care of foes via Crossbow, Spells, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen at 6th level can turn into a Bear with 82 HP, +11 AB, STR 27, Con 19, 20, and turn into a killing machine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's good enough by itself, but can buff yourself, then summon your Brown Bear Animal Companion, and Summon a Boar, then change into a Bear. Then the 3 of you DESTROY EVERYTHING.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Low BAB, AB, Str, Con is NOT a problem with this build.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when your 1 hour per druid lev expires, and change back again, and cant change into a bear again, can either just either rest, sleep, rhen change into a bear again, or whip out your crossbow to go with your 2,3 animals(1 companion, 1 summon, 1 animal empathy).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the more powerful forms become available with going up levels, and being able to use forms more times per day, before rest, goes up with going up druidic levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might hit a wall later, but for now, this build is extremely powerful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso its just a lot of fun, cool, awesome, to turn into some like a bear, and have all your animal friends do the work <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I remember somebody saying that your animal companion, summons will take some of your XP. I checked into this, and I havent seen this.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact I seem to get more xp, level up faster with this build(wasnt expecting that<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the help.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
