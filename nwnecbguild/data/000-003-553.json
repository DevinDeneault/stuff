Are there any particular variations from vanilla NwN rules?<br/>\n- Why have you chosen the classes you have, and in the numbers you have?<br/>\n- Would xp penalties be important for you or not?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would really help if you could follow the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/build-request-guidelines-t515448.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Build Request Guidelines</a>. It helps us to help you get what you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks</div>",
