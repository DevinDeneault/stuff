I've used it often to grab what I can from it while focusing more on other things - after all, it's a very handy class to bolt on. Anyway, I thought now was the time to pay it some more attention - hence this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've gone for a build with full capability to disarm, set and recover all epic traps (apart from plot-specific ones, of course), with a good measure of stealth and acceptable melee abilities (including 14d6 sneak attack damage).<br/>\n<br/>\nNaturally, I have questions: what to take as my final 2 Rogue bonus feats? I opted for Skill Mastery and Slippery Mind, but could easily have gone for an Epic Skill Focus or 2, or a couple of\u00a0 Improved Sneak Attacks, or Self-Concealments. A shrewd or dodgy decision? I also find myself with 51 skill points to distribute. A sizeable chunk will go on Open Lock, but I have no idea how many is good enough to open all locks bar plot-specific ones. The rest I'm looking to distribute between a permutation of Heal, Lore, and Persuade, though there may be better options. If I followed the guidance correctly (which ain't guaranteed), I think I've done what I can with the Search and trapping skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, do please have a look.

I like having high Rogue with nice saves :)<br/>\nI really like how you are questing for knowledge, in fact with you sharing your quest, everyone learns including me!<br/>\nExotic Weapon Proficiency needs BAB +1, so you will need to move it from Level 1 to later in the build. Level 4 perhaps.<br/>\nKnockdown and Improved Knockdown I would take as soon as practical after getting 2 APR, another way to get sneak attacks is important.<br/>\nAgree with Empyre to take Crippling Strike at Rogue 10, improved evasion can be taken later, evasion is already strong, easier to knock them down with lowered strength.<br/>\nAlso agree with Empyre's to space out the non-rogue levels. There is the opportunity to max discipline in the build, and with 400+ skill points, why not :)<br/>\nEpic Traps are set with Modified Set Trap 45 with Take 20 or Skill Mastery, it is fine as it is as it is easy to find +4 dex to boost AB to get a +2 modifier but you can change that if you want<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

But I have given him a challenge. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do agree that a dual weapon focus is a step backwards.<br/>\n<br/>\nStag, in my opinion playing a rogue is to a large degree about having options and being able to control the field by planning ahead. <br/>\nSA is powerful and should be honed. That means taking a lot of it, having a reasonable AB and have many attacks per round for max damage per flurry. IKD helps land SA in toe to toe combat. Stealth gives SA and adds to AB when flat footed and when flanking.<br/>\nStealth also gives tactical advatages. <br/>\nHIPS adds an immense tactical improvement to stealth. In general HIPS is far more powerful than EWS.<br/>\n<br/>\nI already hear you ask: But what about sneak immunes, and what about true seeing?<br/>\nThis is where you will need options, both tactical and by different means to do damage. Here skills come into play. A carpet of traps and UMD for items and spells are examples. <br/>\nTraps and scrolls often work well against difficult warrior types too.<br/>\n<br/>\nRogue is also about defense with evasion, uncanny dodge, slippery mind, defensive roll, epic dodge and self concealment. UMD also adds here with protective spells cast from caster items or scrolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nRogues are also scouts, or commandos if you like, with hidden operations of gathring information and finding the best ways of initiating an attack. <br/>\n<br/>\nRogues gain entrance by opening locks and disarming traps and can be burglars and thieves.<br/>\nThey are masters of skills with most skills as class skills and the highest number if skill points per level.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can build a rogue with focus on martial combat, armed or unarmed. He will be different from a pure warrior, but you can still play him as a warrior. <br/>\nYou don't need any advice on that. You already played the Halfling Champion and you know how to build a warrior.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was not my intention to push this in the direction of mage. There are some good rogue/wizard builds, but UMD and scrolls will do for most rogues.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this makes it more clear where I try to get with this.<br/>\nPlaying a rogue can be a unique and quite different way of handling both combat and other situations in game. <br/>\nMy advice is to try it out and see for yourself if you enjoy it.<br/>\nWhen you know how to play a rogue, you will also know how to build one.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It is best to use all the tools available to you- stealth, traps, UMD, picking off targets one by one, ranged weapons - to the maximum. Later on it gets much much easier. On the topic of UMD, early levels try out if you can, a wand of sleep on low will save enemies. You might enjoy that as a rogue :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

No multiclassing whatsoever, otherwise you will rely on a crutch &amp; play as you normally do with a smidge of sneaking instead. Learn to manipulate the shadows \u00a0for your benefit, learn the trap-stacking, learn to sneak first. Then, as you have made your first steps on this, add 1 level of SD.

That was what led to my decision. Is that wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile yes, an extra feat and more skills would be nice from Human, and keen senses and sleep immunity is good from Elf, I went with Dwarf because of its CON bonus, with no detriment to STR or DEX (the extra +2 saves v spells and assorted other stuff doesn't hurt either). Hin had crossed my mind, as it would, with all its little bonuses - and the larger bonus to DEX - but I always want IKD when going small, and I didn't have feats spare for it (in this build, anyway), nor the stat distribution as I'd need 13+ in INT.<br/>\n<br/>\nDwarf may be a perverse choice, but it's not a random one!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Just at the cave mouth. Think I've finally got to grips with laying my minefields in the wide open spaces and luring folk in (though those invisible merc sods were a nuisance - as were the shamans on the barbar screen). It's much easier in the dungeons and underground. I took advantage of some sage counsel from Hip about laying a carpet pretty much as soon as you arrive, then you've always got a \"safe\" killing field. You can always construct more as you go along. And at least there are loads of traps to recover from the merc screen as well, which is nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd still sell my soul for a Stone of Recall or bags left as easter eggs. I'm a Hin, for Arvoreen's sake - and I'm sure I'm shorter now than when I began thanks to all this to-ing and fro-ing! Just as well my boots seen unwearoutable. Can I play with some friends when I get to Fairloch, please? Preferably burly ones who can carry lots (though I am still tempted by the picture of Maggie and I bursting from between Valennia's legs into combat - the girls on tour! Yes, I'm playing SuD as a girlie: Hin lads just don't seem to work with me - you shouldn't want to punch your own PC, really, should you?).<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and another bit of good news, I'm likely to hit level 10 or maybe even 11 before landing in Fairloch - huzzah!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Afraid I had to rely on a little naughtiness (let's call it resourcefulness, to be kind) to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs is standard practice for me, I parked Criosa out of harm's way, then laid my first minefield just level with where the first wave of merc attacks takes place, having let the valiant guards go belting headlong into the fray (and their doom) as a distraction.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile they were off being hacked to ribbons and thinning the herd, I went trotting over to the emptier side of the screen (left side as you head down the screen), and put down a proper welcome mat. Then I went back and told Criosa to follow me, and made her stop behind this second field.<br/>\n<br/>\nI then scuttled back and pulled those I could into the first minefield. This only left Robert, two of his mercs, and the sorcerer on the bridge. Back to just in front of the second field, where I waved a cheery \"hello\" to them, and they pursued (except that damned sorcerer). Once they were in the killing field, I activated Criosa while I went to play with Spelly McSpell Face. Fortunately, the vast majority of his spells were spent, and I UMD'd and sneaked him to death from a distance. Returned to find Robert on his last legs (well, his horse's), his two friends dead, and a mangled princess-shaped corpse. It didn't take much for Robert to join his comrades in a dirtnap, immobilized as he was. I had one resurrection scroll (I checked before unleashing Criosa), and viola - one chirpy blonde princess intact once more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI lost a lot of potential loot there, it evaporated before I had time to retrieve it. But I couldn't have carried it all anyway and had no way of storing it. And I've only a couple of traps left. Off to Fairloch now at level 10 (might hit 11 on board ship), where life gets much easier...or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I let them all follow me back to the winter area outside the caves. I ask tham all to wait there out of harms way and enter the combat zone alone. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith a trapper, I have taken ranks in craft trap. Then I can craft electric- and fire average- or strong traps. <br/>\nI pull the minions one by one over a trap (or two) with a ranged weapon, run off,  go stealth and attack with a sneak attack. <br/>\nThe spies come under stealth, ofte when you have pulled another minion. One on one they don't do much damage unless they can SA you. Have high detect skills, so you see them come. Use the archer's belt you found earlier to avoid all damage.<br/>\nWhen RB is alone, use a really thick carpet of low tier traps, or a carpet of average or strong traps. Pull him across and see his horse stumble and fall.<br/>\nIf his mage is still there, give him regular minion treatmemt.<br/>\nNow go back to Criosa and have her follow you to town. Ask the soldiers too, if you like.<br/>\nThere are of course other ways to do this. RB is on horse and faster than the others. If you can slow him (tangle), you can run in circles around the whole force with your boots of travelling, bombarding them with fireballs from a necklace or wand. You can combine that with a field of traps...etc.<br/>\nYou can also send forward your cannon fodder and bombard the melee group with fireballs. <br/>\nThese are just some ideas. I am sure that others have different approaches to this battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have HIPS - you can have that by level 8-  well that's another cup of tea.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I must admit that I have not used this method in this specific battle yet, but I would like to test it out. The challenge is how to target RB when surrounded by his forces. He is faster than his troops. That should make it possible to single him out.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother tip if you recover traps. Some mods give xp when you disarm traps. For some reason you don't get that xp when you recover floor traps. You get the xp when you recover traps from doors and containers, though.<br/>\nThis is especially important if you play rogue based modules where a substantial part of xp come from the use of skills; eg: A Dance With Rogues.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

This time I went very much against the grain for me, and took it all as slowly as I could - scouting out areas in stealth and trying, where possible, to pull baddies one at a time. At the outset, traps were hard to come across or afford, so I had to rely on my sling and those little things you can grab from the sage, such as tanglefoot bags. I also tried to prioritise getting the quests done - I could always go back later and mop up the screen - for maximum xp, and so faster advancement. I think my biggest investment in gear was a pair of Boots of Travelling, when I could afford it: they gave me a bit of an edge in getting away from horrid surprises. This was also the first time I made use of the catapult against the big wyvern. Essentially, it's all about getting to know your build, playing to its strengths and attempting to minimize opportunities for others to take advantage of its weaknesses.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing honest, I would have loved Dante and Nell along with me, but that wasn't part of Mick's challenge. I'd also have loved a level of Shadowdancer for HiPS, and maybe some Monk because, frankly, I love me some Monk. But that's a thought for me to explore another day...<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing your name, and with you saying you'd be going elf, one build popped straight into my mind. It's by Mick and contains no Rogue at all (perversely), but it is great. It's his <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/kama-shinobi-monk-9-assassin-26-sd-5-t2350791.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kama Shinobi</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps a bit!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'd have liked Ronan, but he's also a Rogue, so no real point. I ended up doing the girls on tour - me, Valennia, and Maggie. Maggie (our Hin Druid) remains superb, and Valennia, while a proper Barbarian lass, does take some management.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy and large it was a breeze, with the only real problems coming on the Isle of the Dead and in the final confrontation in the throne room. The first was down to those respawning Abyssal Spectres - Val running off before I could stop her (I give these people too much rope) and me unable to lay sufficient minefields. I ended up taking the quickest route to the dead dragon (picking up loot from poor deceased you-know-who). The dragon itself, and indeed the lich, were a walk in the park. The main problem with the throne room battle, was that it starts immediately after the cutscene, which gives you no time to prepare your killing field(s), so a lot of sneaking took place. Maggie and I concentrated on the Cleric, while Val took on the katana WM. Once we'd got rid of Chen (the Cleric) it was relatively simple - though Val did peg out. I brought her back before we went to rescue Criosa. Again. And great was the joy.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne little tip as a trapsmith. That screen you go to to track the hunter who's been killing folk is an absolute godsend. There are a good thirty-forty traps to be recovered in that area - makes blowing up shadow druids much easier!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe build still cries out for HiPS and either Monk or Assassin, but hey, what can you do?<br/>\n<br/>\nTbc, if I, and you, can be arsed.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Should have mentioned, I dropped Slippery Mind for Crippling Strike, and it really is your friend.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
