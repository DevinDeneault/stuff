      "content": "<div>Just picked up NWN:EE and have been working on a character build for a while. I think I've got the class and stat spreads worked out, but I could use some help with class timing and feat selection. The basic concept is a reliable archer that uses Darkness to rack up Death Attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here's the bare-bones:<br/>\n<br/>\nElf, NE/CE, 1-40<br/>\nS- 14<br/>\nD- 16<br/>\nC- 8<br/>\nW- 8<br/>\nI- 16<br/>\nCh- 14<br/>\n<br/>\nBard 1-5<br/>\nAssassin 6-10<br/>\nAA 11-19<br/>\nAssassin 20-40<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seemed fairly straightforward, but of course, that made me feel a little odd. (What's ever straightforward?) AB and AC seem decent enough. Lots of skills to work with. As far as feats go, they also seem pretty easy. All your basic archery feats (PBS, Rapid Shot, WF, Called Shot, etc.) fit right in. Epic feats are also pretty basic. Great Dex and Imp. Sneak Attacks, as well as Epic Prowess and EWF. Can even get a Blinding Speed in there. No self concealment, though, because it doesn't get Improved Evasion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my biggest questions would be whether the class spread seems right, when to take feats (epic in particular) and whether it even seems viable.</div>"

But the entire time, I was just wondering what I could get out of it that I couldn't get from a Rogue/Wiz/AA. And in the end, it just doesn't compare.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to play a Bard/AA/Assasin, Mick's build is what you want. It's not a bad build at all. But there are much better builds that do the same thing.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Rogue/Wizard/AA and Bard/AA/Assassin do have much in common. And you can build them very similar if you want.<br/>\nFor me, in the first combo, I give AA priority for high AB and consistant damage. Wizard serves as a stepping stone for AA with access to scrolls and mage items as a bonus. I only take a couple of levels of Wizard. Rogue is there for the skillpoints and skills and Uncanny dodge - and Epic dodge. I typically take 13 levels and SA is a nice bonus. Trap skills are core as secondary attack.<br/>\nThe assassin build goes much higher on assassin levels for an effective ranged Death attack. AA is primarily there to give EA V to pierce premonition and add some AB and a little extra damage. Bard is there because you need a base class in the build, and Bard is the only class that qualifies for both prestige classes within a reasonable number of levels.<br/>\nI play that build as a stalker, and attack at close range.<br/>\nThe way I build and play, I end up with two very different characters and play styles.<br/>\nLast week I finished playing the assassin build to lvl 40. I tested different play styles. It was very effective when I could pull single creatures from groups with a single long range arrow, before nailing them with a close range Death attack from stealth.</div>",

And I fully accept that it's taken me a while to properly get it - weirdly perhaps, it was playing Mines of Twin Summit that did it for me - possibly because it's a nice hack'n'slash that means I didn't have to over-analyse the plot so could focus more on how not only the build performed, but on how<em> <strong>I</strong></em> performed playing it. (Don't tell Max, but his Playing Guide is still worth the read, btw.)<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",
