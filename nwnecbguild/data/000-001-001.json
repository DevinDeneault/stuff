Bard builds, both with bard as major and minor class provide powerful and versatile characters, that fill a range of different roles.<br/>\n Bard builds can be played as frontline fighters, as archers, as self-buffing fighter-mages, as stealthy rogue types and as multi-talented support characters.<br/>\n A prominent feature of the bard class is the song, a one-click party buffer. When taken to high levels, and combined with the curse song, the song feature becomes a game changer.<br/>\n<br/>\n Some people claim that the bard is a \u201cjack of all trades, but master of none\u201d. Bards are sometimes portrayed as lute wielding wimps, effeminate and mostly obsessed with their looks, while they write verses highlighting other people\u2019s heroic acts. Of course you are free to roleplay your bard like that, hiding behind a big strong warrior and singing songs to inspire the morale, but...<br/>\n The NWN bard is a power class with several features where it outshines every other class in the game:<br/>\n First and foremost bards are <em>masters of song</em>, and that also makes them <em>masters of party play</em>. The bard class is also the <em>master of multiclassing</em>, and the combination of all their powers make them <em>masters of versatility</em>.<br/>\n This makes bard one of the top classes for power-builds in NWN.<br/>\n<br/>\n But bard is also a fun class to roleplay. Even if the game and game mechanics represent performance with song, there are many forms of performance arts out there that your character can pursue. And it is not set in stone that your bard has to be an extrovert, persuasive, unreliable, charismatic character. There are many options if you want to give more depth to your character and divert from the traditional adventure-party scald stereotype.<br/>\n Many experienced players (including this one) say that once you start playing bards, there is no way back.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>The basics</strong><br/>\n Bard is a base class and can be taken at level 1<br/>\n Alignment restrictions: Any non-lawful<br/>\n Hit die: d6<br/>\n Proficiencies: Armor (light, medium), shields, weapons (simple)<br/>\n Skill points: 4 + int modifier ( x 4 at 1st level)<br/>\n Class skills: Appraise, bluff, concentration, craft armor, craft trap, craft weapon, discipline, heal, hide, listen, lore, move silently, parry, perform, persuade, pick pocket, spellcraft, taunt, tumble, UMD<br/>\n Primary saving throws: Reflex, will<br/>\n Base attack bonus: +3/4 levels<br/>\n Spellcasting: Arcane, level 0-6 spells, charisma-based and spontaneous cast.<br/>\n Special feats: Bardic knowledge and Bard song are gained at level 1<br/>\n Epic bonus feats: The epic bard gains a bonus feat every three levels, at levels 23, 26, 29, 32, 35, and 38.<br/>\n Available epic bonus feats are: arcane defense, curse song, epic skill focus (all but animal empathy), epic spell focus, epic will, extra music, great charisma, great dexterity, greater spell focus, greater spell penetration, improved combat casting, lasting inspiration and lingering song.<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It affects all allies within a distance of 30 feet and cannot be dispelled. It improves Attack Bonus, Damage, Armor Class (Dodge AC), Saves, Skills and adds temporary hitpoints. A normal Bard song lasts 10 rounds. The Lingering song feat makes the song last 15 rounds and the Lasting impression epic feat makes the song last 100 rounds. If you have both feats the song lasts 105 rounds. Your bard gets 1 attempt to sing per day for each bard level. The Extra music feat adds 4 songs per day.<br/>\n The Bard song will not affect a character already affected by a Bard song. You will have to wait until the other song expires. So if there happens to be more than one bard in a party, let the one with the best song sing!<br/>\n You cannot sing when silenced, and the song will not affect silenced creatures.<br/>\n<br/>\n The Bard song gets better with higher bard levels and at each level you need a given Perform skill rank for the song to work properly. The song reaches its maximum at level 30.<br/>\n AB maxes out at level 8 with +2<br/>\n Damage maxes out at level 14 with + 3<br/>\n AC maxes out at level 30 with +7<br/>\n The saves max out at level 16 with + 3Will/ +2 Fortitude/+2 Reflex<br/>\n The hitpoints max out at level 30 with +48<br/>\n The skills max out at level 30 with + 19 to every skill rank<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Bard song table</strong><table class=\"post_content_table\"><tbody><tr><td>Bard song lvl</td><td>Perform</td><td>Attack</td><td>Damage</td><td>Will</td><td>Fort</td><td>Refl</td><td>THP</td><td>AC</td><td>Skills</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>9</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>12</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>15</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>8</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>18</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>8</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>21</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>16</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>24</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>16</td><td>4</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>30</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>20</td><td>5</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>35</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>22</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>40</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>24</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>45</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>26</td><td>5</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>50</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>28</td><td>5</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>55</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>30</td><td>5</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>60</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>32</td><td>5</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>65</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>34</td><td>5</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>70</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>36</td><td>5</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>75</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>38</td><td>6</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>80</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>40</td><td>6</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>85</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>42</td><td>6</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>90</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>44</td><td>6</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>95</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>46</td><td>6</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>100</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>48</td><td>7</td><td>19</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n The AB bonus from Bard song counts towards the +20 AB bonus cap. The same goes for the AC bonus. And that is of importance since Dodge bonus from different sources stack. The skill bonus also counts towards the +50 skill bonus cap.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>The sweet sixteen\u2013 and beyond</strong><br/>\n A level 16 Bard song gets max AB (+2), max damage (+3), max saves (3/2/2), AC +5 (vs +7 max), HP +20 (vs +48 max) and + 4 to skills (vs + 19 max). The Perform requirement at level 16 is 30 modified ranks. The Bard song at level 16 is by many players considered a sweet spot where you get the best return from your investment in class levels and Perform ranks.<br/>\n At higher bard levels the increase in Perform requirement becomes steep, with +5 for every level, ending at Perform 100 for a level 30 song. For that investment you get another +2 to AC, and + 28 HPs, which is not that great. But you also get an extra +15 to all skills, and that can have a great impact on gameplay.<br/>\n It is hard to reach a modified Perform rank of 100. You can max out the Perform skill, take skill enhancing feats and try to boost your charisma. A high level Bard song can also help improve the skill, but it will not help you benefit from a better Bard song, since the Bard song will not affect a character already affected by a Bard song. The bottom line is that you will need items with a skill bonus to be able to reach 100.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>The Curse song</strong><br/>\n The Curse song is a negative Bard song, a one-click debuffer that affects all your enemies within a distance of 30 feet and cause penalties to their Attack Bonus, Damage output, Armor Class, Saves and Skills, and cause sonic damage. You need to take the Curse song feat to be able to sing the Curse song, and singing the Curse song uses one of the Bard song attempts per day.<br/>\n The penalties and damage caused by the Curse song improve with bard levels and corresponding Perform skill, exactly in the same way as the Bard song improves the bonus to your party with higher levels. (The only exception is that the Bard song ends at +19 to skills whereas the Curse song table has one less skill point from level 22 and ends at -18 to skills.)<br/>\n The Curse song will not affect a creature already affected by a Curse song. It will not work if the singer is silenced and will not affect silenced creatures. The Curse song lasts 10 rounds, like the Bard song, and the feats Lingering song, Lasting impression and Extra music will also work with Curse song.<br/>\n The Perform skill bonus you get from the Bard song can make it possible to sing a higher level Curse song. To put it simple, this is possible because the Bard song affects you and your party, while the Curse song affects your enemies.<br/>\n Despite being hostile, singing the Curse song does not break invisibility.<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That has a similar effect to improving the AC for you and your party. A nice difference though, is that it happens without counting towards the +20 cap for any given AC type!<br/>\n The same goes for the effect of the Curse song on the enemy AC. That has a similar effect to improving the AB for your and your party, and that too does not count towards the AB bonus cap.<br/>\n<br/>\n For a level 16 song the summarized effect will be +7 AB and +7 AC for your bard and your party:<br/>\n +2 AB from Bard song<br/>\n +5 AB from Curse song (from -5 AC Curse song effect on enemies)<br/>\n +5 AC from Bard song<br/>\n +2 AC from Curse song (from -2 AB Curse song effect on enemies)<br/>\n<br/>\n The +7 AB and +7 AC bonus to the entire party from the level 16 songs make a <em>HUGE</em> difference and will change a fight completely.<br/>\n This effect will max out at bard level 30 where the combined song bonus will be +9/+9.<br/>\n<br/>\n Your bard can even add as much as +6 AB to this entire if you also use the Taunt skill, which is a class skill for bards, successfully on your target creature. One effect of Taunt is to reduce the target\u2019s AC, and thus indirectly act like an AB bonus. In that way even the Taunt effect will not count towards the AB bonus cap.<br/>\n Of the +13 AB from the Bard song/ Curse song/ Taunt combo of a level 16 bard, only +2AB count towards the AB bonus cap.<br/>\n<br/>\n A high level song has tremendous effect on skills. The skill boost from a high level song will make the rogue in your party a master. Your chance to succeed with social skills will flourish. Versus enemies the effect will be even stronger when you combine Bard song and Curse song: The effect on combat will change dramatically when one party has the Discipline, Spellcraft, Taunt and Concentration ranks improved by almost 20, and the other party has them equally shrinked. When a Bard song improves your party\u2019s detect skills by near 20 and the Curse song reduces the enemies\u2019 stealth skills to the same degree, the chance of detection improves vastly. Conversely your success with stealth will improve greatly if the roles are swapped.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\"><span style=\"font-size:120%;line-height:normal\"><strong>Master of multiclassing</strong></span><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>The Bard skill-set</strong><br/>\nBards have a unique set of class skills: Appraise, bluff, concentration, craft armor, craft trap, craft weapon, discipline, heal, hide, listen, lore, move silently, parry, perform, persuade, pick pocket, spellcraft, taunt, tumble and UMD.<br/>\nHere you have access to \u201cfighter\u201d skills, such as discipline, concentration and taunt. You get \u201cmage\u201d skills like spellcraft and concentration. You have several \u201crogue\u201d skills such as tumble, pick pocket and UMD. And you have social skills. Only trap skills, intimidate and spot, will rely on the other classes in your build.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe unique skill set makes the bard class very attractive in multiclassed builds. Using bard as a minor class in a build let you dump bard skills at intervals. In this way bard works as a filler that makes several different build types possible. It can add Discipline, Taunt and Spellcraft to a rogue build. It let you add Tumble, Listen, Taunt, UMD and Spellcraft to a warrior build, or Discipline, UMD, Tumble and stealth to a caster build, and so on.<br/>\nIn a build with bard as major class, a high level song bonus to skills will allow you to invest less skillpoints in several skills, because the song will improve the skills enough to get the job done anyway. Eg; one point in the trap skills, boosted by a high level song, may enable handling of deadly traps.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Bard as stepping stone</strong><br/>\nBard counts as arcane caster and qualifies for the arcane archer and the palemaster classes. Bard is also a spontaneous caster with dragon in its bloodline, and as such qualifies for the Red dragon disciple class.<br/>\nBard based arcane archers, as opposed to wizard- and sorcerer based, will not need a third class pre-epic to get high enough BAB for the 4th attack per round. They will not need a tumble class as third class, and generally have greater freedom when deciding what 3rd class to pick, if any. XP penalty can be an issue though if you pick Bard together with a second primary class for an elven archer.<br/>\nBard based palemasters work well in builds made for physical combat. (For pure casters wizard is better, because the way wizards learn spells fits better the game mechanics of the PM class.)<br/>\nA bard/palemaster/warrior build secures a very robust melee presence with high AC and enables immunity to critical hits. Bard alone with only level 6 spells has not access to epic spells. But if you add 15 or more levels of PM, your already solid build gets access to epic spells such as Epic mage armor and Epic warding.<br/>\nThe red dragon disciple class is a power builder\u2019s wet dream. You get immense stat increases \u2013 especially for strength - improved AC and a list of immunities. Only Bard and Sorcerer can qualify for RDD. Bard is better than Sorcerer in most builds because of the higher BAB and better class skills. Sorcerer can be an alternative in Monk and Paladin based builds because of the alignment restrictions.<br/>\nBard has access to class skills that are needed to qualify for Assassin, Shadowdancer and Harper scout. This secures bard builds the earliest possible access to these classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>How many bard levels you want for your character.</strong><br/>\n1-10 bard levels: At this level range you typically use bard as stepping stone or filler for a multiclassed build. You may take some levels of\u00a0 bard early on to qualify for a prestige class. Apart from that you only use Bard for skill dumps at certain points in the build. The low level song will be of some benefit for the character, but often not enough to invest in the Curse song feat.<br/>\n11-15 bard levels: The Bard song begins to get an AC bonus that translates to an AB bonus when you use Curse song. Your bard gets mid level spells and can benefit from metamagic on low level spells. Sometimes your build ends with 14 or 15 bard levels instead of 16 because you have to give other classes priority.<br/>\n16 bard levels: This is the sweet-spot for the songs. You also have access to level 5 magic.<br/>\n20 bard levels: This is where you get access to Lasting impression, as long as you have an epic character so epic feats are available. With 20 levels you also have full access to bardic spellcasting. Your level 20 Bard song now requires 50 Perform ranks, which is still attainable without items.<br/>\n21 bard levels: This is basically the same as 20 levels with access to Lasting impression and full spellcasting. The extra level let you take Lasting impression early in the epic levels and still have a Bard level for a late skilldump.<br/>\n25 bard levels: At 25 caster levels your spells become immune to dispels, even from Greater dispelling.<br/>\n23, 26 and 29 bard levels: You get epic bonus feats<br/>\n30 bard levels: The song progression stops at 30 levels. This is one more indication that bard is supposed to be mixed with other classes.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Spell failure from armor is a factor for all spells with a somatic component.<br/>\n The magic is charisma based and bards are spontaneous casters. This works in the same way as the magic for sorcerers, but their spell repertoire is different.<br/>\n<br/>\n A level 20 bard knows 5 spells of each level from level 0 to 5, and 4 level 6 spells. The level 20 bard can cast 4 spells per day from each spell level plus bonus spells from charisma and any items.<br/>\n Bards only get level 6 spells and for that you need at least a charisma of 16. Bards cannot learn epic spells. But bards that multiclass with palemaster can still get epic spells if you take 15 or more levels of the palemaster class and choose epic spells when you level up as palemaster.<br/>\n<br/>\n Bards can benefit from metamagic feats. Extend spell, to make spells last longer and Still spell, to avoid armor related spell failure are the most popular. Automatic still spell I and II would make the casting care-free for armored characters, but you need level 9 spells from another class to be able to choose those feats, and most Bard builds never get that.<br/>\n I sometimes see bard specific items with reduced arcane spell failure as an item property.<br/>\n Many Bard players solve the problem with spell failure by removing the armor and shield before casting buffs well ahead of combat, and use stilled spells and non-somatic spells during battle.<br/>\n Bard spells without somatic component:<br/>\n Cantrips: Flare, Light<br/>\n Level 2: Blindness/deafness, Darkness<br/>\n Level 3: Displacement<br/>\n<br/>\n Bards can also to some degree serve as counterspellers. They have access to spellcraft to identify the spells they must counter. Bards have Lesser dispel (innate level 2) as level 1 spell, Dispel magic as level 3 spell and Greater dispelling as level 5 spell. Since bards are spontaneous casters they can choose to use their dispelling line of spells in all their \u201cslots\u201d. They can even use metamagic; still- or silent spell to fill the level 2, 4 and 6 slots and thus be able to counterspell between 20 and 30 spells per day at bard level 20. So the limitation is not in the number of spells but rather that these universal counterspells are limited to countering spells of the same level or lower.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>This is a listing of all bard spells.</strong><br/>\n I wanted to highlight my subjective choices. But then I realized that I could not agree with myself because different build types may benefit from different spells. The list still serves the purpose of demonstrating just that; how bard spells may serve very different purposes. And then I finally managed to highlight some spells after all.\u00a0 (Feel free to post your own list below.)<br/>\n<br/>\n Cantrips: <strong>Cure minor wounds</strong>, Daze, Flare, Light, <strong>Resistance</strong><br/>\n 1st level spells:<strong> Amplify</strong>, Balagarn's iron horn, Charm person, Cure light wounds, <strong>Expeditious retreat</strong>, <strong>Grease</strong>, <strong>Identify</strong>, <strong>Lesser dispel</strong>, <strong>Mage armor</strong>, <strong>Magic weapon</strong>, <strong>Protection from alignment</strong> , Scare, Sleep, Summon creature I<br/>\n 2nd level spells: Blindness/deafness, <strong>Bull's strength</strong>, <strong>Cat's grace</strong>, Clarity, Cloud of bewilderment, Cure moderate wounds, <strong>Darkness</strong>, Eagle's splendor, Fox's cunning, <strong>Ghostly visage</strong>, Hold person, Invisibility, Owl's wisdom, See invisibility, <strong>Silence</strong>, Sound burst, Summon creature II, Tasha's hideous laughter, <strong>Ultravision</strong><br/>\n 3rd level spells: Bestow curse, Charm monster, Clairaudience/clairvoyance, Confusion, Cure serious wounds, <strong>Dispel magic,</strong> <strong>Displacement</strong>, Fear, Find traps, <strong>Greater magic weapon</strong>, Gust of wind, <strong>Haste</strong>, Invisibility sphere, <strong>Keen edge</strong>, Magic circle against alignment, Remove curse, Remove disease, Slow, Summon creature III, <strong>Wounding whispers</strong><br/>\n 4th level spells: Cure critical wounds, Dismissal, Dominate person, Hold monster, <strong>Improved invisibility</strong>, Legend lore, Neutralize poison, Summon creature IV, <strong>War cry</strong><br/>\n 5th level spells: Ethereal visage, <strong>Greater dispelling</strong>, Healing circle, Mind fog, Summon creature V\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>\n 6th level spells: <strong>Dirge</strong>, Energy buffer, Ice storm, Mass haste, Summon creature VI<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It's a pity you can\u2019t afford to take them all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Appraise</strong> - Nice to have where gold is hard to get, but usually not vital<br/>\n<strong>Bluff</strong> - A cool alternative to persuade, but its usefulness depends on how often it is used in dialogues in the mod you play.<br/>\n<strong>Concentration</strong> - This skill helps avoid spell failure from taking damage, and helps resist taunts. A must have for casters, and very useful for melee fighters if\u00a0 your opponents spam taunts. A skill I pick for my bards, if i can afford it.<br/>\n<strong>Craft armor and Craft weapon</strong> - Maybe of some use in extremely barren \u201cliving of the land\u201d scenarios. I never take any ranks in these skills.<br/>\n<strong>Craft trap</strong> - A skill I sometimes take for trappers.<br/>\n<strong>Discipline</strong> - A must have for strength based frontline brawlers. Can also work well for dexterity based characters, and even casters if you boost it with skill focus feats. Helps avoid knockdowns, disarms and called shots.<br/>\n<strong>Heal</strong> - Nice to have in single player if healing potions are scarce and resting limited. Also fine to cure difficult poisons and diseases. Great to use to save dying comrades with healing kits in multiplayer.<br/>\n<strong>Hide and Move silently</strong> - If stealth is your thing, then this is it! Alternatives would be the invisibility spells and potions.<br/>\n<strong>Listen</strong> - This is your scouting skill. It is often better than Spot. You can boost it with the Amplify spell.<br/>\n<strong>Lore</strong> - Bards are masters of lore. You don\u2019t need many ranks here, perhaps only 8 to qualify for RDD. Sometimes lore is rolled in dialogues. Lore bonus is common on items, and you have spells and the bardic knowledge feat to help you out.<br/>\n<strong>Parry</strong> - This skill doesn\u2019t work properly in NWN<br/>\n<strong>Perform</strong> - Every bard needs enough Perform to meet the song requirements. High level bards need it desperately.<br/>\n<strong>Persuade</strong> - The most common social skill in mods, and the most common social skill bonus on items. If you want to take it, is a matter of taste and roleplay choice.<br/>\n<strong>Pick pocket</strong> - This skill can be fun, but has limited value in most mods. In multiplayer the skill has caused much grief, and most servers have detailed pp-rules.<br/>\n<strong>Spellcraft</strong> - I always try to get as much as I can here. The skill gives you a +1 to saves vs spells for every 5 modified ranks. It helps identify spells for counterspelling, and is required for epic spells. It also appears in dialogues, sometimes as an alternative to lore rolls.<br/>\n<strong>Taunt</strong> - This skill is an effective way to improve your hit rate by lowering the AC of your target with up to -6. You can also use it together with expertise to improve your AC, or with Power attack to improve damage and still be able to hit your target. The difficulty class is a Concentration check made by the target against the character's Taunt skill roll. If the Taunt is successful, the opponent suffers an armor class penalty equal to the difference between the Taunt roll and the defender's roll (to a max of a -6 penalty) for 5 rounds. The target will also suffer a 30% chance of spell failure, if they don't resist the Taunt.<br/>\n<strong>Tumble</strong> - A must have. Every 5 ranks of Tumble gives +1 AC. 40 ranks gives +8 AC. Tumble also helps you avoid attacks of opportunity when running past an enemy. The DC is 15.<br/>\n<strong>Use magic device</strong> - Also a must have. The skill let your character use items and scrolls restricted to other classes, races and alignments. The difficulty (DC) of the task is determined by the item value. Trying to use something restricted to another class is the easiest (base DC). Trying to use something restricted to another race adds 5 to the DC, and trying to use something restricted to another alignment adds 10 to the DC.<br/>\nBards can cast from most vanilla arcane scrolls without the UMD skill. Bards can cast from all scrolls restricted to other classes with a modified UMD rank of 10, even at high difficulty settings.<br/>\nSee <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2354638/A-Miniguide-to-Designing-with-the-UMD-Skill\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Hip's UMD guide</strong></a> for further details.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Master of Lore</strong><br/>\nBards get the Bardic knowledge feat which grants a +1 bonus to lore for each class level (max 40).<br/>\nBards have Lore as class skill, like all other classes (max 43)<br/>\nBards can cast the Identify spell for a lore bonus of 10 + 1 per caster level (max 50)<br/>\nBards can cast the Legend lore spell for a lore bonus of 10 + 1 per 2caster levels (max 30)<br/>\nBards can sing Bard song for a skill bonus (max19)<br/>\nIntelligence gives a bonus (eg. intelligence 14 for a bonus of 2)<br/>\n<br/>\nTo identify items the game uses the table: skillvsitemcost.2da. This list maxes out at lore 55 to identify items worth 12.000.000 gold, so the potential max lore for the bard is extreme overkill.<br/>\nBut then again, with enough bard levels and the ability to cast Identify, you never have to put a single point in the lore skill \u2013 unless, of course, you want to qualify for RDD or HS.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\"><span style=\"font-size:120%;line-height:normal\"><strong>Master of versatility</strong></span><br/>\n<br/>\nThe many assets of the bard class with songs and spells for buffing and debuffing and the great potential for multiclassing outlined above, makes the class very versatile.<br/>\nThe available class-spells also reflects this variety with healing spells, summoning spells, attack spells, a reciprocal defense shield, ability buffs, weapon and defense buffs, debuffers and the dispel line of spells, the darkness/ ultravision combo and utility spells for locks and traps etc.<br/>\nThe skill set also reflects this variety with skills from the fighter, healer, mage, scout and rogue domains.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Roles and build types</strong><br/>\nBard builds can fill many different roles. Most bards will work as party buffers. Even at low levels, their song will give a significant bonus to AB and damage. A medium- to high level Bard song can be a game changer. Few Bards are built as dedicated casters, the way sorcerers are, but even so they have spells that make a difference when they buff their party, or debuff their enemies. \u00a0<br/>\nBards can make great frontline warriors, both strength and dexterity based. They are usually mixed with a warrior class for free armor and weapon feats and some extra BAB. But sometimes they are even paired with cleric. The access to the RDD and PM classes, make them shine in that role. They also have great potential as archers, especially when they are built with the AA class.<br/>\nBard can supplement rogue classes very well by adding warrior- and mage related skills, and providing some spell casting and the benefit of the song.<br/>\nIn some scenarios bards can even have a small support role as healer if you take the heal skill and pick the different available healing- and curing spells.<br/>\nBard can also supplement divine classes with their skills, songs and access to RDD. Some of the strongest builds you get are cleric/bard based. There is a charisma synergy when you mix bard with blackguard.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Strength builds</strong><br/>\nThe typical strength build focuses on melee. You want heavy armor proficiency and martial- or exotic weapon proficiency for your bard. The Armor and shield call for stilled spells. Strength based bards usually multi class with combat classes like fighter, barbarian, CoT and blackguard, but also with cleric. And you often find RDD or PM in those builds.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Dexterity builds</strong><br/>\nDexterity based builds can be melee characters with weapon finesse, archers or a combination of the two. They usually have a focus on combat, but many also display rogue skills and stealth.\u00a0 A high dexterity means that you can downgrade your armor to clothing at some point and avoid armor related problems with spell casting. Dexterity bards want uncanny dodge from rogue, SD, assassin or barbarian. Epic dodge is a target for epic levels. Rogue and SD provide the feats you need to qualify for that. Some dexterity builds take the epic self-concealment feats. But a high level undispellable bard will normally rely on casting Improved invisibility instead.<br/>\nDexterity bards benefit from weapon proficiency martial, -exotic,\u00a0-elf or -rogue that provide finesseable martial weapons and bows.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Charisma builds</strong><br/>\nBard has charisma as primary stat for spell casting. But few bards go beyond charisma 16 which is what you need to be able to cast level 6 spells. As opposed to sorcerers it serves little purpose to invest heavily in charisma for increased spell DC with the limited selection of attack spells available for Bards.<br/>\nWhen you see bards with a high charisma, bard usually is part of a divine build with focus on a strong Divine might and \u2013shield, or other charisma related divine feats.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Then you want curse song and lingering. Extra music\u00a0can be of\u00a0value if resting is very resticted.<br/>\n If you go to lvl 20 or beyond and take lasting impression, lingering loses it's value, and extra music becomes pointless because of the long duration and the sheer number of songs per day.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

They usually have a focus on combat, but many also display rogue skills and stealth.\u00a0 A high dexterity means that you can downgrade your armor to clothing at some point and avoid armor related problems with spell casting. Dexterity bards want uncanny dodge from rogue, SD, assassin or barbarian. Epic dodge is a target for epic levels. Rogue and SD provide the feats you need to qualify for that. Some dexterity builds take the epic self-concealment feats. But a high level undispellable bard will normally rely on casting Improved invisibility instead.<br/>\nDexterity bards benefit from weapon proficiency martial, -exotic,\u00a0-elf or -rogue that provide finesseable martial weapons and bows.</div></blockquote>\nI wonder what full bab class mix with dex bard to get the best result? and how many lvls?

The Curse Song is an exact mirror of the Bard Song, exactly replicating the various effects but adversely affecting enemies rather than aiding the Bard's party (apart from one tiny example that Mick details in the section about Song, but that's about skills not AC). Web's table, lifted from the wiki, confirms both that and Mick's table on page 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thought I have is that if where you play has altered the application of Bard/ Curse Song?
