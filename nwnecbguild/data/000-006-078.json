Not bad actually.</li>\n</ul>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Builder\u2019s Commentary</span></strong><br/>\nSilver, sleek, diamond-shrouded, and rocking 6 fists per round whose base damage is greater than that of greatswords, there\u2019s a lot to unpack in this one.\u00a0 What I liked about WebShaman\u2019s Nightshade was pure spell immunity.\u00a0 But I felt it was slightly out of balance in certain melee situations and had to rely on UMD or specific gloves or items.\u00a0 The Astral Wind attempts to thread the needle to find that balance, which is true for most monks in an esoteric sense. The final SR here is 55, and as I broke down above, Level 35 casters and below are powerless (save for Epic Spells which blow throw any monk), and even Level 40 casters have only a 20% chance of succeeding. This is usually more than enough, or at least long enough for one to launch IKD, Stunning Fist, Quivering Palm to drop the frail mage in his tracks.\u00a0 His high AC, combined with Epic Dodge and Empty Body, makes him virtually unhittable in combat, though one should still take Dev Crit into account and do what you can to boost Fort Saves.\u00a0 And when all else fails, you still have HiPS and cheetah-speed to escape.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHe maintains 110% increase to speed, immune to mind effects, poisons, diseases, and even sports a Damage Reduction that makes him immune to Manticore Spikes and Evards Black Tentacles of Intrusion (which, btw, is one of the few spells that bypass SR).<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHis bare knuckles come with a natural 40 AB (halfling variant gets 41), and he has 35 Stunning Fists in his arsenal for those rainy days when you want some strange.\u00a0 But I thought 40 AB was the bare minimum needed to be at least playable in multiple environment-types and milieus.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nLike most Unarmed Monks, you are, in a sense, limited by the quality of gloves available and this will vary with the module and its designer.\u00a0 Yet even HotU has some excellent gloves available.\u00a0 Some worlds, like WoG for instance, even have the option for one to custom craft their own gloves from scratch.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nAnd then one might ask, \u201cDamn GDL, no UMD? What the H-E- Double Hockeysticks?\u201d My response is only this \u2013 the true aesthetic needs no UMD.\u00a0 Take off the training wheels and play your monks old school.\u00a0 It presents a new challenge, new problem solving, and is really quite refreshing in a sense.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n\u201cIs this better than the Nightshade?\u201d No, it\u2019s just different.\u00a0 It\u2019s better in some regards while the Nightshade is better in others.\u00a0 Where the Nightshade gets slightly better SR and UMD acquisition, the Astral Wind gets better AB and slightly better AC, higher HP, and much earlier Uncanny Dodge/HiPS acquisition.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nBuilt and play-tested on the World of Greyhawk Action Server.\u00a0 Slightly shaken but not stirred.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nCheers lads!</div>"

Bah!)<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, there is a certain sense of quasi-immortality with Monks who go deep in level with Improved SR feats, very high AC supported by Epic Dodge, Deflect Arrow, Empty Body, Improved Evasion, HiPS and DM-like speed.\u00a0 It's like a gamer's intoxication, in a way.</div>"
