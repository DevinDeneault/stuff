I have to admit though. Dragon shape with this build is just unreal.. This build will allow you to destroy armies of enemy 30s. It really is that good. </div></blockquote>\n\nThis quote got me curious. Anyone care to elaborate on it? I play on Arelith so anything beyond level 30 is pointless, with the 3 consecutive level rule (the first three levels of every class you must take in a row).</div>"
