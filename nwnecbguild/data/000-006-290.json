To see the original character, with links therein to other builds utilizing the class combination at the time of original posting, see: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build255434.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 55434.html</a> . </div></blockquote>\n<strong>Concept:</strong> The Dark Prince (The Impaler), is based on Prince Vlad (or Dracula which means the \u201cson of the dragon,\u201d as he was known in his own time); a despotic ruler of Romania, whose political and military career is steeped deep in blood and torture. His was a dark and dual nature, both cruel yet highly charismatic: Impaler was a prominent Christian crusader whose sheer will and audacity saved Romania from invading Turks, and his legacy is the model upon which the factual \u201cDracula\u201d of Bram Stoker's undead vampire is based.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis highborn member of a Romanian Court is \u201cprominent in European history \u2013 and more terrifying than his fictional descendant. While not the black-cloaked, centuries-old, bloodsucker of literary fame, the infamy of the historical figure outperforms that of Stoker's creation.\u201d Explains the Crime Library of his despotic rule and his exploits:<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cHe ruled his military kingdom of Wallachia \u2013 southern Romania \u2013 with a heavy and blood-soaked fist. To not only the Turks, but also to many of his own countrymen, he was The Impaler. During his tenure, he killed by the droves, impaling on a forest of spikes around his castle thousands of subjects who he saw as either traitors, would-be traitors or enemies to the security of Romania and the Roman Catholic Church. Sometimes, he slew merely to show other possible insurgents and criminals just what their fate would be if they became troublesome. A pamphlet published in Germany immediately following his death tells of his burning beggars after allowing them free food at his court.\u201d At the same time, \u201cthe adventurous life led by (the Impaler) put him in contact with the era's most fascinating people\u2026and he witnessed the rising use of gunpowder as a means of destruction, the Holy Crusades, the fall of Constantinople and the nouveau philosophy of art, alchemy and culture that became known as the Renaissance.\"  <br/>\n<br/>\n\"Though many Westerners are baffled that a man whose political and military career was as steeped in blood as was that of Vlad Dracula,\" writes Elizabeth Miller for the Journal of the Dark magazine, \"the fact remains that for many Romanians he is an icon of heroism...It is this duality that is part of his appeal:\" see, <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/history/vlad/index_1.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/seri ... dex_1.html</a> <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Dark Prince (The Impaler)<br/>\nBlackguard(25), Fighter(12), Rogue(3)</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>I Attributes:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 16 (30)<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 12<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 16<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman, Any Evil (Theme: LE)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>II Level Guide:</strong><br/>\n01: Fighter(1): luck of heroes, toughness, power attack<br/>\n02: Fighter(2): cleave<br/>\n03: Fighter(3): weapon focus<br/>\n04: Fighter(4): STR+1, weapon specialization, (STR=17)<br/>\n05: Fighter(5)<br/>\n06: Fighter(6): knockdown, expertise<br/>\n07: Fighter(7)<br/>\n08: Blackguard(1): STR+1, (STR=18)<br/>\n09: Blackguard(2): blind fight, {Smite Good}<br/>\n10: Blackguard(3)<br/>\n11: Fighter(8): improved critical<br/>\n12: Blackguard(4): STR+1, Divine Shield, (STR=19)<br/>\n13: Blackguard(5)<br/>\n14: Blackguard(6)<br/>\n15: Blackguard(7): divine might<br/>\n16: Blackguard(8): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n17: Blackguard(9)<br/>\n18: Fighter(9): great fortitude (OR, Improved Knockdown)<br/>\n19: Fighter(10): great cleave*<br/>\n20: Fighter(11): STR+1, (STR=21)<br/>\n21: Blackguard(10): epic fortitude<br/>\n22: Rogue(1)<br/>\n23: Blackguard(11)<br/>\n24: Blackguard(12): STR+1, epic skill focus: move silently, (STR=22)<br/>\n25: Blackguard(13): epic weapon focus<br/>\n26: Fighter(12): epic weapon specialization<br/>\n27: Blackguard(14): epic skill focus: hide<br/>\n28: Blackguard(15): STR+1, (STR=23)<br/>\n29: Blackguard(16): Overwhelming Critical*<br/>\n30: Blackguard(17): great strength I, (STR=24)<br/>\n31: Blackguard(18)<br/>\n32: Blackguard(19): STR+1, devastating critical*, (STR=25)<br/>\n33: Rogue(2): great strength II, {Evasion}, (STR=26)<br/>\n34: Blackguard(20)<br/>\n35: Blackguard(21)<br/>\n36: Blackguard(22): STR+1, great strength III, Armor Skin, (STR=28)<br/>\n37: Blackguard(23)<br/>\n38: Blackguard(24)<br/>\n39: Blackguard(25): great strength IV, epic prowess, (STR=29)<br/>\n40: Rogue(3): STR+1, {Uncanny Dodge I}, (STR=30)<br/>\n<br/>\nNote\u2014Non Dev.Crit Alternative: If for some reason you are uninterested in Dev.Crit and/or it\u2019s banned on your world, then feel free to swap out Grt.Cleave for IKD, OC for Epic Fiendish Servant (Epic Vrock Pet), bumping AS to where DC currently is (followed by EP to where AS currently is) and grab another sneak die (Impr.Sneak Attack where EP currently is) instead, or other feats of your own choosing. <br/>\n<br/>\n*Skills Alternative--Don't want Stealth?
