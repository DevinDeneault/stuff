Hereby this is no one-trick cleric for you to see here, but rather a well-oiled machine that does everything and does it well.

By taking the least amount of non-cleric levels he attains great penetration for his spells, even greater undispellablilty that even Mord's will have trouble dispelling you and huge durations for his buffs. Tremendous saves, Sky-high AC, Evasion, Divine feats, Great Taunt ability, Descent Evocation spells DC for Hammer of the Gods and Implosion, and so on..

Charisma has synergy with turn undead, but you will probably not use your 10 (?) turn undead attempts for anything but DM and DS.<br/>\n I agree with taking KD here rather than blind fight, even though I always try to have room for both.<br/>\n What I miss here is spellcraft. I would try to increase intelligence to 14 to get it, and start out with strength 15, even if I would end with an uneven number on wisdom or strength. Intelligence 14 also opens up for expertise (as Max would take), but I would not know what feat to sacrifice. You have already pushed GSF to an epic bonus feat and delaying another meta-magic feat to epics at the cost of wisdom is the only option I can see atm. I am uncertain about the wisdom af that.</div>",

      "content": "<div>Hey guys!<br/>\n<br/>\n Interesting approach to Cleric you have here, Val. I like this guy. Who wouldn't? But I do have a few improvements to suggest. Some are personal preference, some are slight improvements.<br/>\n<br/>\n Indeed you beat me to it, Mick! That was the first tweak I was going to suggest. As a matter of fact I would do it differently. I did an alternative version of this build where I applied several of the tweaks I was going to suggest. Although I find it a valiant effort to invest in Spell Focus feats, I think that it is a bit of a wasted effort. It will likely only work in battles that you'd win anyway to make them easier. In tough battles, you'll still get resisted most of the time. So I thought for a while and here's what I came up with:<br/>\n<br/>\n - Alter your stats to 16 / 8 / 12 / 13 / 13 / 14. This will allow you to take Expertise, but it'll also have the undesired side effect of you not being able to cast spells higher than 6th level for quite some time. You'll still be a competent self-buffer, but your Wisdom will be raised via Cleric bonus feats, leaving you with more room for CHA increases (for a total of 26 at level 40). You'll also have 40 more HP and a higher fort save than this guy. What you lose are the Spell Focus feats and 1 Wisdom modifier.<br/>\n - Alter the spread to 35 / 2 / 3, remove one Paladin level and add one Monk. Then start with Cleric at level 1 and don't take Weapon Focus. Clerics don't need Weapon Focus because early on they don't fight, and later on, when their buffs start kicking in, they hit without it anyway. Take Weapon Focus at level 18 along with the first Paladin level for the first Discipline and Taunt dumps. It will make no difference.<br/>\n - Leave Wisdom at 20 and cast just to take advantage of the enemy weak saves. If you want the evocation focus, I would leave CHA at 20 and go heavier on wisdom. I'd take 2 of the following 3 in place of Empower and SF Evocation: Blind Fight, KD and Craft Wand.<br/>\n - Get a DEX item and walk around in robes after the first MONK level (which I would take at level 22). Forget the shield. You'll have the same AC this way (and a much higher carrying capacity). You'd lose 13 from a FP +5 and 8 from a Tower Shield +5. You'd get 5 from Dex (item, Cat's and AoV), + 11 from Wisdom and +5 from the robe. You save your weight capacity and at 37 you get an increased movespeed as well.<br/>\n -if you want to relinquish one AB point, you can move the first Monk pre-epic and select Weapon Focus on a Kama, then take advantage of the Monk goodies much earlier. It's much better to use the Divine feats on 8 attacks per round than on 5, right? You can avoid the loss of AB by altering the spread and going Cleric 32 Monk 6 Pal 2 and getting free IKD, another point of AC, higher saves, more skill points (you can go Cleric 16 Monk 4 pre-epic and start with Monk at 1). You gain all that and lose an Epic Bonus Feat and 3 CLs. This would also require a stat tweak, but it's perfectly doable.<br/>\n<br/>\n With these tweaks you'll have the same AB, the same AC, more movespeed, higher CHA and just lose a bit of casting prowess (or not). I'll email you the tweaked versions for comparison.<br/>\n<br/>\n A Cleric with huge saves, Taunt and DM/DS! Well done!<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div>"

In WoG where there are shield bracers, The Justicar can achieve 78 AC with robes. That's without any kind of combat trick or hard to get items and mostly we are talking about day's long self-buffs. We must also not forget that Clerics can be virtually immune to anything that requires a save just because of their buffs (death ward, freedom, negative energy protection e.t.c). And for those that they aren't The Justicar has saves in the fortie's with buffed charisma and ability scores. He can also self-heal and self-restore himself should anything bad happens. Therefore i find it really hard, to justify in a feat-tight build, the usefulness of the expertise feat. You can get it if that's what you truly want, yes. I would select the SF: Evocation feat to replace for that, but why give up on a net (+6) DC for all my great Evocation spells (Hammer of the Gods, Blade Barrier, Implosion) for a feat that i can hardly justify?<br/>\n<br/>\n Another point that was made was the lack of Spellcraft in this build. Well, normally i would replace another skill for that instead of buffing Intelligence but exactly because of the reason that i wanted this build to be as complete as possible, i will lower my strength by two point and buff both constitution and intelligence by the same amount. The loss of 1 AB/Dmg is isn't going to hurt the build so much and i prefer to be as bulletproof as possible. I agree 100% with you here Mick. And since i am there, i will make a change also to the weapon icon of the build. If you are not going to take improved critical like i do not here, then best is making sure to have the highest possible critical range initially for your weapon, and there is none better, than a scimitar for this very purpose. In fact you won't even feel the need to have it, since with a keen scimitar your critical chance will be already at (15-20) range.<br/>\n<br/>\n Max, your suggestions were overall good but i will respectfully refuse to make this holy warrior another glorified farmer in disguise, therefore no kamas for him ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks for all your valuable input!</div>"

I knew you would, man! LOL! It's like me with my Half-orc priest of Kord :D. Me is Half-orc, Me no Human!! Part of the concept. Totally get it.<br/>\n<br/>\n But, let me tell you about the Expertise usefulness. You don't have Uncanny Dodge, and you have Taunt. Expertise should be taken to use when Taunting for the combo. I know you read my playing better post, so you know how good the combo is. Well, maybe knowing and SEEING are two different things. Take any of your toons that has Expertise and Taunt and do it. It's splendid! I swear that combo alone can get a severely gimped toon from 1-20.<br/>\n<br/>\n Moving on, I didn't suggest that you should get rid of the SF feats only, I suggested that you should do that WITH THIS SETUP. That part of the sentence was important. I would aim for at least\u00a038 Wisdom (with items), which would require 26 ability score to be able to rely on the spells as well as viable tools in a tough fight. The way you set it up here, some of\u00a0the spells may work, but they won't be as reliable with only 22 Wisdom as you wanted them to be investing in SF feats. Implosion DC at 40 would be\u00a010 +\u00a012 (WIS modifier already factoring capped WIS) + 9 (Spell Level) + 3 (innate DC) + 6 ESF feats for a total of 40 (Robilar has 42 Fort lol, even Marloes with her 48 Wisdom failed miserably when she tried to implode him!). That's for a 9th level spell with +3 innate bonus to the DC. Hammer of the Gods will have 32 DC. Those numbers, although not nearly as low as they'd be without the feats, are not Reliable. You will succeed on some and fail on others, unless the encounter is easy, in which case you don't really need the spells. I'd advise you to keep CHA at 20 and go for 26 WIS as your lowest acceptable score. Then I would say the feats are worth the investment. My opinion, as always, lol. I'll email you the other versions for comparison, then you can tell me what you think.<br/>\n<br/>\n But I DO like this guy. A good build with a very strong RP feel to it, it emanates holiness, but you know a glorified farmer would kick ass with this setup lol. I'll make you one to try to tempt you! :D<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div></div>"

I went against my own advice, but I only did so after he walked around for 2 rounds in the area of effect of my SoV and suffered no consequences. Funny thing is he got stunned 3 seconds after he Devcritted me and you! I agree that each player should adjust the value of each stat according to their personal preference, however, I really think you haven't considered the proper implications because of your reasoning in the above post. Let me see if I can explain what I mean:<br/>\n<br/>\n You gain ZERO AC by upping Charisma, in fact, you even lose unbuffed AC. I never suggested you to up Strength, as that would sort of go against the concept. I understand that low STR is part of the concept and I'm OK with that (although I would, if optimizing him for Melee, most likely make him a DEX toon, which would have\u00a0-2 STR than this guy fully buffed thanks to DP making your STR 18\u00a0lol). But that's beside the point. The point is, the choice here is between WISDOM and CHARISMA only, so let's look at the upsides and downsides of investing in each stat. Both stats give AC, CHA through DS and WIS through Monk AC, and I would say that\u00a0Monk AC is way more reliable because 1- It doesn't need to be activated and 2- you don't lose it when flat-footed. Therefore the choice here is: Wisdom for higher Spell DCs, more spells per day and permanent AC (which is fully in line with your idea of making him an effective caster as well), or CHA for more Saves, more buffed damage and\u00a0the same amount of\u00a0Dodge AC. Because of this, I would suggest going for 26 WIS and 20 CHA (I believe I emailed you that variant). That would not give you the Dodge CAP, but it doesn't matter because you will get AC anyway (and permanent instead of activatable)\u00a0and make much better use of the SF feats with +2 to all your spell DCs while losing a bit of damage and duration on the Divine buffs and 2 to all saves.<br/>\n<br/>\n I do believe that switching from 22/24 (WIS/CHA)\u00a0to 26/20 (WIS/CHA)\u00a0will make your toon much more powerful and versatile. I think 2 points of damage and 2 to all saves is a small price to pay for the spells per day and spell DCs (and unbuffed AC). If you consider WoG specifics, you can still\u00a0get better\u00a0Dodge AC due to some sandals that dwell in the depths of the earth if you want KD immunity or with a Monk boots +5 (which gives an additional DEX boon as well). Monk boots are also pretty common in SP modules, at least the ones I played. So technically you don't even lose the Dodge AC increase :D<br/>\n<br/>\n Come on man! Swap those stats! You know I'm right! LOL<br/>\n<br/>\n Take care!</div></div>"

I would be severely inclined to drop Empower Spell. The only non-stat-buff\u00a0spell I see being Empowered is Blade Barrier at level 8. Perhaps Hammer of The Gods at 6 if you REALLY need Divine damage, but we both know we use it for the stun, not the damage itself. At level 7 I guess you can also empower Flame Strike, but\u00a0again, the AoE isn't that great and what could a FS accomplish that a divine-favored-divine-mighted\u00a0arrow through the forehead or a slash of your darkfired\u00a0sword\u00a0could not? You'll lose a bit of spellbook management, but you'll be left with the following spell setup:<br/>\n<br/>\n 1- Divine Favors (all), maybe one endure elements or prot from alignment if you have to swap gear and need to cast long-term stuff<br/>\n 2- Extended Divine Favors (all except one or two) 1 Extended Bless 1 Extended Shield of Faith (before level 18 if you don't have Brooches of Shielding or a Deflection AC item after level 18, which is when it caps)<br/>\n 3- Extended Stat buffs (Wis, Str, Cha, Dex) if you can't find gear to help with stats, 1 or 2 MVs (for armor and shield at first and when you switch to robes just 1), as many Darkfires as possible (on WoG only, for arrows and melee weapons)<br/>\n 4- Death Ward, Extended Negative Energy Protection, 3 Extended Prayers, the rest are HoTGs.<br/>\n 5- All Extended Divine Powers, 1 Extended Freedom if you need to swap gear<br/>\n 6- 3 Extended Battletides,\u00a01 Extended True Seeing, 1 Extended Spell Resistance, rest for Harms / Blade Barriers<br/>\n 7- Word of Faiths (all except one), maybe a few Destructions or Greater Restorations, 1 Extended Greater Sanctuary (to flee if you need to)<br/>\n 8- 3 Extended Regenerates, 3 Extended AoVs, the rest either Mass Heals or Fire Storms<br/>\n 9- Divided evenly between SoVs and Implosion, maybe one or two\u00a0Summon Creature 9 if you need summons<br/>\n<br/>\n This spellbook setup doesn't include Domain spells, because of WoG domain restrictions, but you should be able to squeeze them in there depending on which god you choose to be. It should leave you plenty of room to work with. You fight with Divine Power and Divine Favor\u00a0(not-extended although if needed you can use an extended one)\u00a0most of the time and have 3 FULL POWER MODES per day, where you go to maximum AB mode, Regenerate 6 HP per round, reduce enemy AB and AC with Battletide\u00a0and get AoV stat increases. You also have a few spells to stun or insta-kill your enemies that need to be conserved for tough fights. If you want, you can tone down and only get two full power modes a day, I guess it depends on playstyle. I am normally comfortable with 3, but if you can live with 2, then you'll have some more room for offensive spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n I would also like to see Scribe Scroll in there. Then you can scribe Summon Creature and Mass Heal scrolls and have more slots for SoV, Fire Storm and Implosions. But again, what do you drop in a build that can't even afford Blind Fight and IKD, right? I guess you'll just need to buy them.<br/>\n<br/>\n And I would still recommend you to go Cleric at level 1 and swap 1 Paladin for 1 Monk level. Paladin 3 gives you Remove Disease (since Turn Undead you already have) and Monk 3 gives you 20% Movespeed, which is much better.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div></div>"

Thanks again <br/>\n<br/>\nPhmah2408<br/>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Maximillian Kane wrote:</cite>\nHey guys!<br/>\n<br/>\n Interesting approach to Cleric you have here, Val. I like this guy. Who wouldn't? But I do have a few improvements to suggest. Some are personal preference, some are slight improvements.<br/>\n<br/>\n Indeed you beat me to it, Mick! That was the first tweak I was going to suggest. As a matter of fact I would do it differently. I did an alternative version of this build where I applied several of the tweaks I was going to suggest. Although I find it a valiant effort to invest in Spell Focus feats, I think that it is a bit of a wasted effort. It will likely only work in battles that you'd win anyway to make them easier. In tough battles, you'll still get resisted most of the time. So I thought for a while and here's what I came up with:<br/>\n<br/>\n - Alter your stats to 16 / 8 / 12 / 13 / 13 / 14. This will allow you to take Expertise, but it'll also have the undesired side effect of you not being able to cast spells higher than 6th level for quite some time. You'll still be a competent self-buffer, but your Wisdom will be raised via Cleric bonus feats, leaving you with more room for CHA increases (for a total of 26 at level 40). You'll also have 40 more HP and a higher fort save than this guy. What you lose are the Spell Focus feats and 1 Wisdom modifier.<br/>\n - Alter the spread to 35 / 2 / 3, remove one Paladin level and add one Monk. Then start with Cleric at level 1 and don't take Weapon Focus. Clerics don't need Weapon Focus because early on they don't fight, and later on, when their buffs start kicking in, they hit without it anyway. Take Weapon Focus at level 18 along with the first Paladin level for the first Discipline and Taunt dumps. It will make no difference.<br/>\n - Leave Wisdom at 20 and cast just to take advantage of the enemy weak saves. If you want the evocation focus, I would leave CHA at 20 and go heavier on wisdom. I'd take 2 of the following 3 in place of Empower and SF Evocation: Blind Fight, KD and Craft Wand.<br/>\n - Get a DEX item and walk around in robes after the first MONK level (which I would take at level 22). Forget the shield. You'll have the same AC this way (and a much higher carrying capacity). You'd lose 13 from a FP +5 and 8 from a Tower Shield +5. You'd get 5 from Dex (item, Cat's and AoV), + 11 from Wisdom and +5 from the robe. You save your weight capacity and at 37 you get an increased movespeed as well.<br/>\n -if you want to relinquish one AB point, you can move the first Monk pre-epic and select Weapon Focus on a Kama, then take advantage of the Monk goodies much earlier. It's much better to use the Divine feats on 8 attacks per round than on 5, right? You can avoid the loss of AB by altering the spread and going Cleric 32 Monk 6 Pal 2 and getting free IKD, another point of AC, higher saves, more skill points (you can go Cleric 16 Monk 4 pre-epic and start with Monk at 1). You gain all that and lose an Epic Bonus Feat and 3 CLs. This would also require a stat tweak, but it's perfectly doable.<br/>\n<br/>\n With these tweaks you'll have the same AB, the same AC, more movespeed, higher CHA and just lose a bit of casting prowess (or not). I'll email you the tweaked versions for comparison.<br/>\n<br/>\n A Cleric with huge saves, Taunt and DM/DS! Well done!<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!\n</div></blockquote></div>"

There are spells that you'll use early on and then never use again, and other spells that you'll start using later, and will become key to your strategy. So, what I can suggest is that you should go to the Game Guides section of this forum and read my Cleric guide. I discuss spells and playability in there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope it helps!</div>",
