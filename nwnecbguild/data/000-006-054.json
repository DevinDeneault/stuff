      "content": "<div>Cupidon (Cupidon means Cupid in french) aka \"love is blind\", a dev crit HiPS Archer with huge damages : bard 9 / SD 2 / AA 29<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm in dev crit HiPs builds now, so here's another one with low melee defense, but strong ranged presence.<br/>\n<br/>\nBackstory :\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nWikipedia :\u00a0In\u00a0classical mythology,\u00a0Cupid\u00a0is the god of desire,\u00a0erotic love, attraction and affection. He is often portrayed as the son of the love goddess\u00a0Venus\u00a0and the god of war\u00a0Mars. He is also known in Latin as\u00a0Amor\u00a0(\"Love\"). His\u00a0Greek counterpart\u00a0is\u00a0Eros.\u00a0Although Eros is generally portrayed as a slender winged youth in\u00a0Classical\u00a0Greek art, during the\u00a0Hellenistic period, he was increasingly portrayed as a chubby boy. During this time, his iconography acquired the\u00a0bow and arrow\u00a0that represent his source of power: a person, or even a deity, who is shot by Cupid's arrow is filled with uncontrollable desire.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis dude is as Cupid, you can't see him and his arrows are filled with unctrollable desire, but not a desire to love, a desire to die.<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/download/file.php?id=940\"/><br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupid#/media/File:Eros_bow_Musei_Capitolini_MC410.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Source</a><br/>\n<br/>\nExplanation of the build :\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe aim of the build was to build an archer with Hips, dev crit, and good damages. There's many ways to get enough strengh and AB with an archer to get dev crit. The RDD way (bard RDD AA fo exemple, or bard AA fighter, but you can't get HiPS here). The only way for HiPS and dev crit is Bard AA Shadowdancer. AA gives you ranged AB + heavy damages, SD gives you HiPS, evasion and uncanny dodge to secure your dex AC.<br/>\nThe build is very adaptable, this version is juste one of mine. You can choose less dex, more strenght according to the dev crit DC and AB and AC you prefer, depending on your playstyle and game environement. The gameplay is focused on HiPs since your AC and HP are low, stay in the shadows and strike them all. Use scrolls and wands with UMD for the hardest fights.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe build :\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nBard(9), Arcane Archer(29), Shadowdancer(2), Elf, any non lawful (chaotic good for RP).

Unless you're doing it all wrong, of course!<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Also (forgot to mention before), I really prefer Spot over Listen for ranged builds. I know Bard doesn't get it, but AA does. While I'm at it, with 2 pretty horrid saves as is, some Spellcraft would have been nice to see. Pick Pocket is a bit of a luxury, and you over-egg the UMD somewhat for a Bard build - unless you want it for using items rather than scrolls - so I reckon you could squeeze some in.</div>",

Listen was a melee choice, a pavlovian reflex due to the habit !<br/>\nPick Pocket is an omission from an old version of the build. About UMD, I use it for items and scrolls, but to save some skills point for spellcraft here is a real good idea. I'm gonna edit the first post.</div>"
