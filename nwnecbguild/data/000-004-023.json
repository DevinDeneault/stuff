      "content": "<div>This is my take on the shadowpriest when lvl 20 is the ceiling.<br/>\n Like most clerics this build is a buffomaniac driving a natural BAB of +13 to a sky high AB. The monk attack progression grants 5 attacks/ round and can be raised to 7 attacks per round with Divine Power and Flurry of blows.<br/>\n The character is intended to be played in monk robes, but will benefit from a shield and an armor through the earliest levels.<br/>\n War domain will provide dex buffs (Cat's and Aura of Vitality). Trickery will grant Improved invisibility and a +9 boost to sneakiness from Divine Trickery.<br/>\n Other domains may be preferred depending on the setting where you play.<br/>\n<br/>\n Priest of the shadows<br/>\n<br/>\n Cleric(17), Monk(1), Shadowdancer(2), Human<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>Alignment: Any Lawful</strong></span><br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 10<br/>\n DEX: 16 (18)<br/>\n CON: 10<br/>\n WIS: 16 (19)<br/>\n INT: 14<br/>\n CHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n Human: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n 01: Cleric(1): Dodge, Blind Fight, Domain Trickery, Domain War<br/>\n 02: Cleric(2)<br/>\n 03: Cleric(3): Weapon Finesse<br/>\n 04: Cleric(4): DEX+1, (DEX=17)<br/>\n 05: Cleric(5)<br/>\n 06: Cleric(6): Extend Spell<br/>\n 07: Monk(1): {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}<br/>\n 08: Cleric(7): DEX+1, (DEX=18)<br/>\n 09: Cleric(8): Mobility<br/>\n 10: Cleric(9)<br/>\n 11: Cleric(10)<br/>\n 12: Shadowdancer(1): WIS+1, Weapon Focus: Kama, {Hide in Plain Sight}, (WIS=17)<br/>\n 13: Cleric(11)<br/>\n 14: Cleric(12)<br/>\n 15: Cleric(13): Toughness<br/>\n 16: Cleric(14): WIS+1, (WIS=18)<br/>\n 17: Shadowdancer(2): {Darkvision, Uncanny Dodge I}<br/>\n 18: Cleric(15): Improved Critical: Kama<br/>\n 19: Cleric(16)<br/>\n 20: Cleric(17): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 180<br/>\n Skillpoints: 125<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 12/16/14<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +5<br/>\n BAB: 13<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 18 (melee), 17 (ranged)<br/>\n Fully buffed +37, 5-7 attacks per round in robes, 3-4 attacks per round if in armor<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 22 (35-38 fully buffed)/26 (40 fully buffed)<br/>\n Spell Casting: Cleric(9)<br/>\n Alignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\n Concentration 23(23), Disable Trap 1(3), Hide 20(24), Move Silently 20(24), Open Lock 1(5), Spellcraft 23(25), Spot 15(19), Tumble 20(24)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Concentration(4), Disable Trap(1), Open Lock(1), Spellcraft(3), Save(9),<br/>\n 02: Concentration(1), Save(13),<br/>\n 03: Concentration(1), Save(17),<br/>\n 04: Concentration(1), Save(21),<br/>\n 05: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5), Save(20),<br/>\n 06: Concentration(1), Save(24),<br/>\n 07: Concentration(1), Hide(10), Move Silently(10), Tumble(10),<br/>\n 08: Concentration(1), Save(4),<br/>\n 09: Concentration(1), Save(8),<br/>\n 10: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5), Save(7),<br/>\n 11: Concentration(1), Save(11),<br/>\n 12: Hide(5), Move Silently(5), Spot(5), Tumble(5),<br/>\n 13: Concentration(2), Save(3),<br/>\n 14: Concentration(1), Save(7),<br/>\n 15: Concentration(1), Save(11),<br/>\n 16: Save(16),<br/>\n 17: Hide(5), Move Silently(5), Spot(10), Tumble(5),<br/>\n 18: Concentration(3), Save(2),<br/>\n 19: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5), Save(1),<br/>\n 20: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5),<br/>\n<br/>\n Edited typos and AB figures<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><span style=\"color:#000000\">edit: per Hip 20160627 (corrections/additions of missing info, in</span></em><span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong> red</strong></span><em><span style=\"color:#000000\">)</span></em></div>",

      "content": "<div>Hey Mick.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know I like this build a lot, right? How could I not?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a tweak to suggest. Take out 2 points from STR at start and put them in CON. It matters little with Divine Power. So much so that if you want to make him a Halfling (and are willing to eat up the XP Penalty with it) you can leave starting STR at 6 and it'll get capped with DP alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not saying that going Halfling is a good idea. In fact it's not, because you're so tight on skill points already. However, having means of Invisibility, you can buff up while invisible and drop Concentration and Spellcraft. Spellcraft can be \"replaced\" with the Spell Resistance spell (or rather the need for it suppressed, as long as you're not dispelled), and Concentration is just to cast in melee. Who does that with a HiPSer? If you consider that, you can drop Toughness and go Halfling for +2 AB / AC and a bit of bonus to the stealth skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood job with that buffomaniac otherwise <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

      "content": "<div>You can get more sneakiness by taking the last SD level later for higher stealth skill dumps, but that also delays uncanny dodge. <br/>\nConcentration also protects against taunting. However,  you have a good point, you can live without it as long as you can HIPS away before casting. If you free up skillpoints, I suggest more spot and perhaps some search.<br/>\nSpellcraft is a skill I like to have for the save bonus. It works differently than spell resistance, and they supplement each other.<br/>\nThe build caps str at 22 as long as you cast DP before AoV.</div>",

      "content": "<div>You can also cap STR at 20 by casting DP and then AoV if you leave it at 8, but you'll get 20 more HP and +1 FORT save for having more CON even when you're not buffed with these two spells (and by all means whenever you fight you should have these buffs on you), instead of +1 to damage, which this guy already has plenty of. But I guess it all comes down to personal preference in the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Really loving this build. I'm playing in a low-magic server where 20 is the max level. HiPs has saved me quite a few times and I'm loving the AC bonuses from dex and wis.<br/>\nOn the other hand you get 9th lvl spells at lvl 20 which kinda hurts considering SoV is just sooo good. Also the duration of AoV is a joke, even the extended version, but I rarely even see it go off as I cast all my buffs-&gt;enter the fight-&gt;got 5 Greater Dispels coming at me and then it's just me and Darkfire left.</div>"
