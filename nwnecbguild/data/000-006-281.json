The weakness with this build is that it requires an alignment change, but that change is along the Lawful to Neutral Axis, which is the easiest to make, with plenty of time in which to do so. <br/>\n<br/>\nSummary: A talented young cadet joins a military paladin order for all the right reasons, firmly believing that without law and compassion there can be no justice, and rises through the ranks quickly; granted a command (Wing Commander), the Aviator is assigned to what is a top secret mission (aka Operation Dragon Skies), thus joining an elite fighting force comprised of aviation pioneers who, like the Commander, are daring, bold and adventurous. Essential qualities to be found not in disciplined Knights but in pioneers\u2014those who make history, such that an alignment change (\u201cinner bard\u201d) is to be expected along the way (going where no one has gone before with courage, honour but at the same time a zest for adventure\u2014the love of flight and \u201cfreedom of the skies\u201d taking hold, becoming far more important to the Commander than enforcing Code, and yet  at all times good and brave, remaining committed to the defense of the people, but doing so as an aviation pioneer, not in code enforcement. Should a player be uninterested/unable to make an alignment change for whatever reason, a sorcerer variant will follow as included in the original post, and found along with the other combos here: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build277359.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 77359.html</a> .\n</div></blockquote>\n<strong>Concept:</strong><br/>\nIt is said that Leonardo Da Vinci invented a \u201cflying machine\u201d in medieval/Renaissance times, his flight theories based on the study of birds, which centuries later led to the development of an actual glider for human use, among other civil and military inventions, including: the tank, gun powder missile, ballista, and the parachute. Initially, Da Vinci\u2019s flying machine was based on an idea of human-powered wings; although this idea was dropped by him in favor of another based on gliding techniques, what if, instead, his earlier ideas had worked, such that humans could in fact have flapping wings\u2013could early medieval air force flyers, capable of carrying out bombing (fire) missions, and critical extraction exercises, have been the result?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>WING COMMANDER (Renaissance Aviator, Tactical Command)<br/>\nPaladin(26), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Bard(4)</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>I Attributes</strong>:<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 18 (40)<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 12 (14)<br/>\nWIS: 14<br/>\nINT: 12 (14)<br/>\nCHA: 8 (10)<br/>\n<br/>\nRace: Human / Alignment: LG (Start), NG (End)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>II Level Guide:</strong><br/>\n01: Paladin(1): Power Attack, Cleave<br/>\n02: Paladin(2): {Smite Evil}<br/>\n03: Paladin(3): Weapon Focus: Greatsword \u2013or- Scimitar*<br/>\n04: Paladin(4): STR+1, (STR=19)<br/>\n05: Paladin(5)<br/>\n06: Paladin(6): Knockdown<br/>\n07: Paladin(7)<br/>\n08: Paladin(8): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n09: Paladin(9): Blind Fight<br/>\n10: Paladin(10)<br/>\n11: Paladin(11)<br/>\n12: Paladin(12): STR+1, Improved Critical: Weapon, (STR=21)<br/>\n13: Paladin(13)<br/>\n14: Paladin(14)<br/>\n15: Paladin(15): Toughness (or, Great Fortitude)*<br/>\n16: Paladin(16): STR+1, (STR=22)<br/>\n17: Paladin(17)<br/>\n18: Paladin(18): Great Cleave<br/>\n19: Paladin(19)<br/>\n20: Paladin(20): STR+1, (STR=23)<br/>\n21: Paladin(21): Epic Weapon Focus: Weapon<br/>\n22: Paladin(22)<br/>\n23: Paladin(23): Overwhelming Critical: Weapon<br/>\n24: Paladin(24): STR+1, Great Strength I, (STR=25)<br/>\n25: Paladin(25)<br/>\n26: Paladin(26): Devastating Critical: Weapon<br/>\n<br/>\n27: Bard(1): Great Strength II, (STR=26), *Alignment Change* <strong>(Must be Non-Lawful by HERE).</strong><br/>\n28: Red Dragon Disciple(1): STR+1, (STR=27)<br/>\n29: Red Dragon Disciple(2): (STR=29)<br/>\n30: Red Dragon Disciple(3): Great Strength III, (STR=30)<br/>\n31: Red Dragon Disciple(4): (STR=32)<br/>\n32: Bard(2): STR+1, (STR=33)<br/>\n33: Red Dragon Disciple(5): Great Strength IV, (STR=34)<br/>\n34: Red Dragon Disciple(6)<br/>\n35: Red Dragon Disciple(7): (CON=14)<br/>\n36: Red Dragon Disciple(8): STR+1, Epic Prowess, (STR=35)<br/>\n37: Bard(3)<br/>\n38: Red Dragon Disciple(9): (INT=14)<br/>\n39: Red Dragon Disciple(10): Epic Fortitude Or, Improved Knockdown*, {Darkvision}, (STR=39), (CHA=10)<br/>\n40: Bard(4): STR+1, (STR=40)<br/>\n<br/>\nPvP Note: it is highly recommended you select Epic Fortitude instead of IKD; while the latter is really quite nice PvM/E (for downing huge things like Dragons, etc.), in the PvP game of dev.crit (fort save v insta-death) you will really prefer +4 to your Fort save (with option for more--i.e., Grt.Fort instead of toughness, and which if so becomes Fort 30, +1 Song: 31 (39 self-buffed) [45 vs. Spells]); the idea either way being that, with but a single item--remember: you've divine grace on top of that, too--you can pretty much dev.crit with impunity, also being immune to fear, fire, paralysis, with Paladin book giving immunity to death magic, mind-effects (protection), slow and entanglement (including movement speed decreases), too.

This is an AWESOME build, with otherworldly AB and good DC for Devcrit. That said, I need to ask you two things: <br/>\n<br/>\n1- How is changing alignments in the chaotic-lawful axl easier than good / evil? Is that a specific from where you used to play? In general, wherever I played, becoming less lawful was nothing short of impossible.<br/>\n<br/>\n2- Have you considered going for more CHA and less STR? By removing just 2 points from STR at start, you'd end up with 38 str, and 14 (16 after RDD bonus) CHA, which in turn, combined with Eagle's Splendor and Aura of Glory, and dropping Toughness, you could add either Divine Might or Divine Shield for more AC or Damage in certain situations. I would go for Divine Shield, you`d trade at least +6 AC, if you factor in gear, +9 for +1 AB and damage. I'm not considering the Smites, which would make this even better, just once a day. <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Well come on over and have an ale, as I've the day off. <br/>\n<br/>\nGot Pally smiters on the mind, eh? (Yeah, happens to me, too ... LOL). That said, this ain't a Smiter, but a Dev.Critter with a high DC and everhthing speaks to that. Not some puny human, peh, but a Flying Ace--TOP DOG. No watering it down by removing STR for Charisma, no messing with the DC, AB, etc. as this be about pure air force devastating power: killing things fast, and chewing through mobs. Best defense is a strong offense always--and with a Dev.Crit DC 48 (self-buffed, 52 w. a +4 STR item), heh, wave \"bye bye\" to your enemies. You hit, you crit. They die. Simple. And with Drake Charged STR-based damage, and Pal damage buffs, different kinds, too, no worries chewing through the crit immune undeads either. The beauty of this build are the sheer synnergies here between Paladin and RDD. with the Cha (Aura/Glory) coming in on the saves---Fort 35 self-buffed (41 vs. Spells]) assuming EF, a so-called PG-Human warrior with a Paultry Dev.Crit 42 (44 with that same +4 Str. Item), well, xo what. A simple +5 ring alone takes you to 40 Fort (46 v. spells); not to mention PG/AB, Damage and IKD, eh?  Silly human; heh, oh wait, he's dead, no? HPs are important, too. Thing about Flying Aces/Figher Pilots you see they just don't fool around. Places to be, other missions to go on. Focussed! So don't be messing with the AB/damage and Dev.Crit DC set-up, eh? Quite simply, the dead don't strike back  ... So be a Flying Ace and go in for the kill, knock those  enemies down and out of the skies! Not in an evil way of course, defending the people after all ... (and very playable, too!  (Thanks, Max). <br/>\n<br/>\nAllignment Change:<br/>\n Did a write-up about Knights (Paladins) of Bahamut (Dragonborns, half-human, half-drake),basing a series around it NWN2/ECB2 actually (including a Divine Dragon, hmmm.. totally different character, and just might be making a debut here in the EXB1 soon. (This one be all about the AB/Damage set-up and of course PG/High DC Dev.crit and enjoying it with impugnity--you hit, foes die, you move on). Shouldn't \"need\" an alignment change, based on Bahamut (though the Bard as a Flying Ace, performing in the skies, etc. does make entire sense,not just build-wise but RP wise, too). Can't find it off hand but will look for it. Some interesting stuff. Anywho, Becoming LESS Lawful is EASY--you act law-LESS NOT EVIL. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn PvP dedicated worlds, it's super easy to change one's alignment (no problem at all). On RP-servers, you MUST usually act the part (only fair). Become chaotic, and act like a bard. Neglect your \"duties\" and choose dialogue options with NPCs carefully; get a reputation around town and other players. Do things a Paladin wouldn't do, but a bard would: get \"drunk\" at the local tavern, sing a song. Sleep in and don't be so quick to help the old lady find her missing pet or, if do, demand a reward. Think about the spirit of the early aviation pioneers, who did it because they thrived not only on adventure but also the very real sense of danger involved, with a \"hell be dam'd\" attitude about it, throwing caution to the wind (literally!). If the place is a stickler about it and won't allow for alignment changes where players are properly telling a story and carrying it out, then find antoher server as that's not proper RP at all. (Don't like the ones that expect Paladins to run around like zealots and blind fools either; being a slave to dogma is hardly justice, nor is playing judge, jury and executioner all at the same time either. Doesn't make for good builds, much less good RP'ing either in my view. I know some are sticklers, though: it's too bad and sorry to hear that. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf so, take a level of Sorcerer instead (as per the link to the originals, which sorcerer variant I will get to, promise). Myself,  love everything about the Paladin, the RDD and the Bard: and Bard fits the Wing Commander both build-wise AND RP wise best. Though Sorc of course works, too. <br/>\n<br/>\nSlash, Sing and CRIT (not Smite, that's Crit...on) ON!!! ~ Try</div>"
