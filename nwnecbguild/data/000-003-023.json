My interest has been rekindled. Especially, with news of new multiplayer support, hoping for that boon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I had an idea of an Elven rogue, not that strange, I just remembered they got the look 'check' for their search skill I believe, without needing to rely on the other things (alongside perma-detect mode)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is for Arelith a lv 30 server, but I've done most of the work I think...maybe. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRogue(19), Fighter(6), Shadowdancer(5), Elf<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR:\u00a0 12<br/>\nDEX:\u00a0 19 (26)<br/>\nCON: 12<br/>\nWIS:\u00a0 8<br/>\nINT:\u00a0\u00a0 14<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\nElf: (Sleepless, Hardiness vs Enchantments, Bonus Proficiencies, Skill Affinity (Listen, Search, Spot, Keen senses, Low-light vision)<br/>\n01: Rogue(01): Luck Of Heroes<br/>\n02: Rogue(02): {Evasion}<br/>\n03: Rogue(03): Weapon Finesse, {Uncanny Dodge I}<br/>\n04: Fighter(01): DEX+1, Weapon Focus , (DEX=20)<br/>\n05: Fighter(02): Blind Fighting<br/>\n06: Fighter(03): Great Fortitude<br/>\n07: Fighter(04): Weapon Specialization: <br/>\n08: Rogue(04): DEX+1, (DEX=21)<br/>\n09: Shadowdancer(01): Knockdown, {Hide in Plain Sight}<br/>\n10: Shadowdancer(02): {Darkvision}<br/>\n11: Shadowdancer(03)<br/>\n12: Shadowdancer(04): DEX+1, Improved Knockdown, (DEX=22)<br/>\n13: Rogue(05)<br/>\n14: Rogue(06)<br/>\n15: Rogue(07): Improved Critical: <br/>\n16: Rogue(08): DEX+1, (DEX=23)<br/>\n17: Rogue(09)<br/>\n18: Rogue(10): Iron Will, Improved Evasion<br/>\n19: Rogue(11)<br/>\n20: Rogue(12): DEX+1, (DEX=24)<br/>\n21: Shadowdancer(05): Epic Weapon Focus: , {Defensive Roll}<br/>\n22: Rogue(13): Crippling Strike<br/>\n23: Rogue(14)<br/>\n24: Rogue(15): DEX+1, Armour Skin, (DEX=25)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been reading a bit, and not entirely sure, but I heard it was better to go with a one-handed weapon and shield, rather than dual wielding (unless I invested in ranger), though that was like... several years ago posted xD. (Not sure if dual-wielding is even feasible without severally handicapping myself, nor do two shortswords/rapier seem...viable.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe issue I have (although I'm not sure about the feat setup myself, is the weapon). I thought about the rapier, but I don't know if Elves get a massive penalty on that like say a halfling or something would. Would a Rapier be better or 'decent' instead of a shortsword or dagger in this case? Since it is a 'bigger' being.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's more 'personal preference' but I'd rather it not 'cripple', perhaps, crippling strike or 'sneak attacks' etc.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Looks good so far!<br/>\n<br/>\nDual-wielding is fine; it works especially with the rogue class because you get extra hits in every round, which means more sneak die when you're sneak attacking. Since you're taking Shadowdancer, you dont need to worry that much about AC, because you'll be HiPSing out of melee anyway. But if you do need the AC, you can always just switch to a shield. (I was persuaded away from using the two-bladed sword in favour of two shortswords for this reason in my own thread, <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/knockdown-specialist-level-20-t2354777.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>)<br/>\n<br/>\nElves are regular size, so no worries about the rapier; but if you use the rapier in the offhand you'll get a penalty because its not a 'light' weapon, which might be what you're thinking of. (What counts as a 'light weapon' for dual wielding is also different from what counts as a 'light weapon' for weapon finessing, which introduces a lot of confusion!) Using a rapier in one hand and a light weapon (like a shortsword or dagger) in the other wouldn't incur a penalty, though. I think that's kind of how they intended dual-wielding to work - a finesse fighter with a rapier in one hand and a dagger in the other, you know, which people did in real life (although they didn't get 'extra attacks' for it!) - but most people use the same weapon in both hands because it saves taking an additional Weapon Focus or Weapon Specialization.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're going to single-wield, a rapier is just fine, but for dual-wielding you might prefer two short swords (or maces). I'd go for two shortswords personally - using a rapier as a HiPSing rogue is kind of 'double dipping', since the rapier's main gimmick is its increased crit range. Getting an extra 2d6+1 here feels a bit anaemic if you compare it to the 5d6 you're getting every hit from a sneak attack! If you do want to dual wield, some of those improved saves feats could probably go in favour of the requisite Ambidexterity/Two-Weapon Fighting/Improved Two-Weapon Fighting. Otherwise, the rapier is nice &amp; in theme :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not experienced enough with the game (or building - or Arelith!) to feel qualified suggesting a level 30 build, but a few things that occur to me thinking about higher levels:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Make sure to take a level of rogue at level 30 to grab Use Magic Device 33, letting you cast all scrolls without a chance of failure (although I think thats using your modified chance of failure, which is -1 due to the low Cha unfortunately, so a 5% chance of failure - oh well)<br/>\n- Another level of Shadowdancer will get you defensive roll for free (rather than using another rogue feat on it) so you can grab Epic Dodge early, although I imagine you're already taking that since on Arelith Shadowdancers dont get HiPS until level 5. (And your crappy Summoned Shadow gets epic dodge if you have it, apparently!)<br/>\n- Might also be worth taking a 5th level of fighter for the +1 to AC on Arelith<br/>\n- You also get the 'Kensai' path available as a Rogue, I don't really know that works on Arelith, but they get an extra attack(!) and some added AC, and some bonuses to skills, at the expense of casting spells (dont bother with UMD if you're going this route, then) - with 7 attacks per round and +3 to AC you'll be a monster :P<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully this was helpful!<br/>\n<br/>\nedit: ouch, I totally missed the XP penalty and the missing dodge/mobility - shows I have a lot to learn <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi there, Valehand, just a couple of thoughts for you - feel free to ignore them!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you were to go with a Rogue 16/ SD 6/ CoT 8 you avoid any xp penalty (admittedly, less a problem on PWs than in modules). You also get a nice natural boost to your saves from CoT, meaning you can afford to drop the LoH/Great Fort/Iron Will feats. It would mean you taking 10 levels of Rogue before you could qualify for CoT, but you'd still be able to grab Dodge, Blind Fighting, and Weapon Finesse as well as Weapon Focus (and Improved Evasion at level 10). If you then throw in 4 levels of CoT, you've got Mobility, Knockdown and Imp Crit as well, so you'd be able to start taking SD at 15 should you wish. You might want to push it back a little, though, if you want to dual-wield, and take 2 more CoT levels for Ambi and 2W-Fighting (at 15 and 16). You've then got the option of Imp 2W-Fighting at 18, be that at Rogue or SD.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, admittedly, this would mean you'd lose WS and presumably EWS, but I don't think you'd miss it too much, with all the sneaks you'll be putting in, and in epic levels you'll still be able to reach Epic Dodge and Crippling Strike (as well as Defensive Roll, of course). It would also mean a later full development, but I merely put this up as an option.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I don't know whether you were planning on taking a Gift or two at creation (DEX+2 and/or INT+2)?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I say, just thoughts for you!<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT:</strong></em> I see you've just ninja'ed me!

If not, go for one weapon type (probably shortsword).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe real bummer here is Arelith requiring 5 levels of SD for HiPS. And if that's all you want the class for it's a big investment in a level 30 build. If you were to swap SD out for something like Monk, or Bard, or more Rogue, you could still get excellent Hide/MS ranks, just without HiPS. Still, you know what you're looking for...<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

For ED you need Improved evasion and Defensive roll. You may also want to take ED as a rogue bonus feat. That means you still have room for 2 epic skill foci. I don't know Arelith enough to tell how high stealth skills you will need. But with a dexer, maxing the skill ranks and taking epic skill foci, you get elite stealth.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Two weapon fighting you want to take three feats: TWF, Ambidexterity and ITWF. <br/>\nWielding a weapon off hand gives one off hand attack. ITWF gives another off hand attack. <br/>\nTWF and Ambidexterity remove penalties. You also want to wield a light* weapon off hand to minimize the penalties. *Light here means small or tiny for an elf.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a Ranger feat that is called \"Dual wield\". You get it for free at Ranger level 1. It reduces penalties in the same way as TWF and Ambidexterity together, but it only works when wearing light armor or clothes.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can only take Slippery mind as a rogue bonus feat. You can also get it if you take 7 levels of SD. But I don't think you have room for it if you want both ED and the epic stealth skill feats, and 6 fighter levels. <br/>\nYou probably will not have room for Iron will either if you want both SD and two weapon fighting.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

A more fighter (or CoT) heavy build gets more combat feats and less rogue bonus feats. It finally boils down to\u00a0 what you want in. If you have made a different build, it may well be worth looking at.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

In light of that, I'd take Blind Fighting at level 1, keep Finesse at 3, take Exotic Proficiency at 6 and Focus in katana at 9.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the swapping of Crippling Strike and Improved Evasion - I suspect I automatically took Improved Evasion at Rogue 10 because that's what I'd always done - bad Stag.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are, of course, quite right about shortswords, but I was trying to compensate for the loss of Weapon Specialization (and its Epic brother) by taking a more damage intensive weapon that also has a good crit threat. Oh, and the kewlness factor, of course. <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the feedback, Empyre!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Nothing to do with Empyre's feedback, but I just had a thought - maybe a good dollop of early trapping skills would be helpful for those first 10 levels of pure Rogue.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

One possible way of having both - and boosting the BAB and saves by +1 - would be to take 2 more levels of CoT, both pre-epic, postponing Rogue 12 and 13 until epic levels. The cost would be the loss of either 1 level of Rogue and 1 of SD, or 2 Rogue levels. My temptation would be the latter - Improved Evasion would still be available at Rogue 13 (assuming taking Empyre's suggestion of grabbing Crippling Strike at Rogue 10). And if Rogue 12 and 13 were taken at levels 21 and 22, followed by 5 straight SD levels, at 27 the toon gets HiPS, Defensive Roll as givens and Epic Dodge as a general feat. This would allow for Rogue 14 to be taken at level 30, so getting the last UMD dump (Tumble finishing with SD5 at\u00a0 level 27). It means losing Slippery Mind, but the bonuses from SD6 (better DR, concealment, +2AC, +1 to Hide, as well as moving to a Shadow Fiend summons) outweigh it, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, the danger is that the build becomes even less of a Rogue, which Valehand might not like much.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
