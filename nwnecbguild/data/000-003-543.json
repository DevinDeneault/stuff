I would normally be out testing one or two, but NwN has crashed on me again (every time I try to load up SP WoG, btw), so all I have left is my trusty pencil and paper.<br/>\n<br/>\nDolly is a hefty lass who prides herself on becoming a sergeant leading a wall of Dwarven Defenders from her beginnings as daughter to an unwed barmaid in Fairloch. She's my attempt at a re-tooling of the Dwarven Wall and Valerfor's subsequent reworking thereof (which I sadly can't find atm, but have thoroughly enjoyed playing). She has two of my three favourite classes (CoT and DwD), missing only Monk, but we can't have everything. I've kept her simple (particularly the skillset, but then there ain't a lot of leeway there), and elected to focus in Dwarven Waraxe because, well, why wouldn't you? If there aren't any where you play, pick another dwarfly weapon for her, please, and you gain another feat at least. This is also the first time I've picked the Great Cleave feat without going for Dev Crit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, see what you think of her...<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Dolly Rockroot</strong><br/>\nFighter 8/ CoT 10/ DwD 22<br/>\nDwarf - lawful non-evil<br/>\n1-40 PvM<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Stats</strong><br/>\nSTR 16 (30)<br/>\nDEX 13<br/>\nCON 18 (21)<br/>\nWIS 8<br/>\nINT 13<br/>\nCHA 6<br/>\n<br/>\nHPs: 684<br/>\nAC: (naked) 17, (full plate) 25, (+tower shield) 28<br/>\nSaves: Fortitude 36, Will 23, Reflex 24. +2 v poison, +2 v spells (<em>maybe +6, depending on skills taken</em>), +1 v traps<br/>\nSkills: 129.
