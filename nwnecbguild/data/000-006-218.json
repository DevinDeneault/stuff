I've taken Weapon Focus early on as the small boost is worth more at low levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n Taking Zen Archery at level 15 is purely due to the timing of the shift from Dex to Wis giving the highest bonus, but to be honest, it doesn't really matter when you take it, especially if you plan on wearing Wis enhancing items. Monk levels are chosen to coincide with skill dumps into Tumble. Also, you'll need 5 points in Hide and the Cleave feat for Blackguard and I guess it won't hurt to have the AC and bonus Monk feats by the time you get Wild Shape and are ready to start throwing down in melee.<br/>\n<br/>\n The 8 levels of Blackguard pre-epic is for the extra attack per round. Level 9 and 10 of Blackguard are essential to delay the Epic Druid bonus feat until WIS=30. Swap them for Monk and you get Wholeness of Body, which is complete pants, at the cost of +1d6 sneak attack. Between Blackguard and Druid summons you have an entire army of meat-shields at your disposal, who rather kindly also make your shots sneak attacks, so I'd rather have the extra damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n Once you acquire elemental form you should be able to dish out a beating like a proper thug, with 6 attacks per round, +1 if you want to use flurry, Druid buffing spells and your heavies to give you sneak attacks. Shift back to elf and you can hit them with offensive spells or an arrow to the knee*.<br/>\n<br/>\n At level 40 it shouldn't even be a question; you now have all the tools to re-enact the car door scene from that movie Lock, Stock.<br/>\n<br/>\n After creating this I suddenly realised I should probably have a look for similar builds before posting and looking like a right twat. I could only see 1, available here: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/515338/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tiamat's Claw by KailPendragon</a> however, I feel mine is still different enough to warrant a look.<br/>\n<br/>\n This is the first time I've posted a build, so all comments/criticism welcome, be brutal - I promise I won't cry.<br/>\n<br/>\n *not actually to the knee<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><span style=\"color:#000000\">edit: per Hip 20160917 (corrections/additions of missing info, in</span></em><span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong> red; </strong></span><em><span style=\"color:#000000\">relinked reference build)\u00a0</span></em><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

This is not an archer build.<br/>\nAll your available shifted forms override strength, dexterity and constitution. Keep them low and invest primarily in wisdom. Wisdom is good for your spells, for your AC and for earlier access to Dragon shape.<br/>\nYou should still have points available to buy intelligence and charisma, if you want that.<br/>\nA low dexterity means that you can pick human over elf for more skillpoints and and an extra feat. That will also cure your 20% XP penalty.<br/>\nBuilding with 3 classes that all have alignment restrictions, leaves you with several alignment shifts to handle. If you can adjust the alignment where you play, that's OK. But if not, then the build is not achievable.<br/>\nBetween the 3 classes, the 10 levels of BG are the less productive, power wise. More and earlier Druid development would  be stronger and easier to level with the spellpower and earlier access to shapes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you call synergy, im my eyes you simply want too much in. That more often than not weakens the build.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

But then I'd lose KD/IKD.  Or I could boost monk to 9 for Improved Evasion.  Is it worth it?  I could lower Druid to just 18 (like your very own Forsaken Dragon) and have more Monk and Blackguard for IE and an extra +1d6 sneak attack, at a cost of Elder Elemental shape and spell DC (although factoring in Mr Daggers suggested improvements allows for Greater Spell Penetration, so it's not quite as bad as it first seems).<br/>\n<br/>\nTotally off topic, and don't take this the wrong way, has anyone ever mentioned how annoying your signature is to Brits?  (OK, maybe just this Brit) I always have to read it twice - once as \"eee-zed\" then I'm like \"wait, it's zee, damn it, not again!\".  Don't change it though!

The one you mentioned is GREAT, but it suffers greatly with dispellability and has one alignment shift. I built that one in my early days, but looking at it now, it's very strong only if not dispelled, and when a Druid gets dispelled, it REALLY HURTS, especially if you are shifted.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn't cut back on Monk, in the one I linked here I did because I had CoT bonus feats with which to take KD and IKD, but in yours there aren't any, so it's not worth it. Neither would I cut the Druid aspect of it. You will be a great caster, and none of the other classes will give you anything worthwhile to compensate what you'll lose in terms of caster levels and spells, and shapes and bonus feats, for not going with more Druid. IMO, 6 Monk and 24 Druid is fine. <br/>\n<br/>\nFunny you say this about my signature, I'm Brazilian and I teach English for a living. One of my former colleagues at the course I quit this year is British and he and I used to bust each other's chops with the whole \"driving on the wrong side\" thing.

That would also make pre-epic leveling A LOT harder because you won't get Elemental Shape till epics.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for your build, I'd follow Mick's guidelines. You don't want to invest in ANY physical stat in a non-shifter Druid build because they get overridden by ALL OF YOUR SHAPES. I'd also keep Druid at least at 24 for maximum Owl's Insight benefits. I question the usefulness of 10 BG levels in this build. It does give you Sneak Attack and all, but I wonder if the cost is worth it. An alternative spread could be Druid 24 Monk 9 BG 7. You'd lose 1d6 SA and 1 BAB, but you'd gain +30% Speed bonus from Monk Speed, Improved Evasion and Wholeness of Body, while still keeping a full attack schedule as long as at least 4 BG levels are taken pre-epic, which is better IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Since you would drop some of the Longbow feats per the above advice, you could take KD, IKD and Epic Prowess.  Take Monk at lvl 40 and you don't have to worry about the XP penalty, go Human as Mick said to get more skills and an extra feat and Paladin early on opens up all Martial Weapons (and Heavy Armor if you're so inclined).  You lose the Sneak Attacks and Bull's STR from BG but you get Divine Favor, Aid, Bless, and Prayer to help with damage; keep the +2 to saves; and immunity to fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, Taunt is a must (and Expertise if you have room for it).
