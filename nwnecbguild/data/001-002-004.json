I'm reaching out for some assistance, these old eyes of mine appear to not be able to figure out what in the seven hells I'm doing wrong ( I know it's on me, this is not me passing blame to anyone else) but I can't seem to for the life of me figure out why I'm not able to gain access to world of Greyhawk. Is there an easy installer someplace or an easier way of doing it than placing all the files in the folders manually that I am unaware of? I've tried about a dozen different times now, going in sequence of first to last (up to down) of putting everything in its proper place and yet.. It still isn't working.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it's me screwing things up somewhere, and this is not meant to pass blame. So I'm instead asking if there's a \"installer for dummies\" option or summat like it. Thanks in advance for any assistance rendered! <br/>\nI am in love with the world of Greyhawk as it was the original setting that I got into when it came into tabletop, and would love to explore it from a fresh perspective.\u00a0<br/>\nDawi forever,<br/>\n-Ragar Stormwynd<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

There is no installer, one must manually move the files. People there are pretty good at helping others.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/worldofgreyhawkfr/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/worldofgreyhawkfr/</a><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

We share many members, but while we're devoted to building, they're focused entirely on the WoG side of things. DM Wise is the site's boss, as well as being behind the construction and development of the PW. I'm sure he'd be more than happy to let you know what you need to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Ninja'd by gkorjax!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
