High strength, assassin improved invisibility, weapon master crit range UMD etc. No exp multiclass penalties<br/>\n<br/>\nBase AB 50.<br/>\n<br/>\nTried to get assassin 9 asap to get its special undispellable improved invis without hurting the AB too much<br/>\n<br/>\nHe had to invest a lot of effort to become very smart, its hurt his constitution so he gets a toughness feat along the way. Perhaps I should take that feat earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe a human might have more skill points (to max listen, for example), a dwarf or gnome more HP but I think only half-orc can get to the AB quite that high,\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway hope you enjoyed reading this, feel free to leave comments/suggestions<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Assassin(10), Weapon Master(22), Fighter(8), Half-Orc\nSTR: 19 (34)\nCON: 10\nINT: 14\n\n01: Fighter(1): Expertise, Weapon Focus: Scimitar\n03: Fighter(3): Mobility\n05: Fighter(5)\n07: Weapon Master(1): Weapon of Choice: Scimitar\n09: Weapon Master(3): Blind Fight\n11: Weapon Master(5)\n13: Weapon Master(7)\n15: Weapon Master(9): Cleave\n17: Assassin(1)\n19: Fighter(7)\n21: Fighter(8): Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar, Epic Weapon Specialisation: Scimitar\n23: Assassin(5)\n25: Assassin(7)\n27: Assassin(9): Great Strength, (STR=27)\n29: Weapon Master(12)\n31: Weapon Master(14)\n33: Weapon Master(16): Great Strength, Devastating Critical: Scimitar, (STR=31)\n35: Weapon Master(18)\n37: Assassin(10)\n39: Weapon Master(21): Great Strength, (STR=33)\n\nSkillpoints: 192\nSaving Throw bonuses: Traps: +2, Poison: +5\nAB (max, naked): 50 (melee), 31 (ranged)\nSpell Casting:\u00a0\n\n\n01: Discipline(2), Hide(2), Intimidate(2), Move Silently(2), Open Lock(1),\u00a0\n03: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Intimidate(1), Move Silently(1),\u00a0\n05: Hide(1), Intimidate(1), Move Silently(1), Save(2),\u00a0\n07: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(6),\u00a0\n09: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(10),\u00a0\n11: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(14),\u00a0\n13: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(18),\u00a0\n15: Save(26),\u00a0\n17: Set Trap(14), Tumble(20), UMD(2),\u00a0\n19: Save(4),\u00a0\n21: Save(4),\u00a0\n23: Search(1), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n25: Search(1), UMD(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n27: Tumble(5), UMD(1), Save(9),\u00a0\n29: Discipline(4),\u00a0\n31: Discipline(4),\u00a0\n33: Discipline(3), Listen(1),\u00a0\n35: Discipline(1), Save(6),\u00a0\n37: Tumble(10), UMD(5),\u00a0\n39: Discipline(1), Listen(3),\u00a0</details>\nEdit: changed name to Half-orc assassin\u00a0mafioso (which is a synonym for thug but sounds cooler)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
