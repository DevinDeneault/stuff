She is one of the most underwhelming builds that Bioware folks have been able to come up with, as when she takes Wizard levels, instead of Intelligence, she pumps Constitution. Pityful, to say the least. As for the build itself, she was an Assassin who used magic to aid her combat strategy. However, I didn't ever manage to see her as a Rogue, although she needed to be stealthy, rogue-ish. So I made her a Ranger (rogue warrior) dual-wielder with 10 Wizard levels to give her some very nice buffs but without focusing too much on it. The main focus of the build is Assassin, as she spends most fo the time telling stories of Assassin training and how she was sent to assassinate the Seer. This build should use level 2 spells as Invisibility (except for a few long-term buffs, such as Cat's Grace, Flame Weapon and Extended shield), level 3 as Extended Invisibility (except for GMW until you get a better weapon). Keen Edge won't apply to Shortswords, since they're Piercing weapons. Level 4 spells should be divided between Extended Haste and Improved Invisibility and lvl 5 should be Extended Improved Invisibility. That way you will in a way have HiPS, because you will have many spells to become invisible in combat if you need to flee or cast anything. The DC to your DA will be lowish, but should still paralyze weaker Fortitude types, such as mages. She can come from invisibility, cast True Strike and KD any opponent she can't paralyze, so they won't stand a chance either way. Her AB is 70 with Capped Dex and True Strike, and the enemies won't have Dodge and in some cases Dex AC, so she'll only miss on a 1. And dual-wielding, with Haste, she will have 7 attacks, which means 3 in the first flurry. Deadly!<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, my friends, here she is: Nathyrra!<br/>\n<br/>\n Ranger(12), Illusionist(10), Assassin(18), Elf<br/>\n<br/>\n Alignment: Any Evil<br/>\n<br/>\n Playability: 1-40
