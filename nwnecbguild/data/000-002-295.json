Judging from his recent absence (How dare he sneak away like that without even a postcard!) I can only assume he is there now and spending some quality time with the natives. Nonetheless I am sure his thoughts are with us here at the ECB.<br/>\n<br/>\nHurry back, Kail!  We are growing every day!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
