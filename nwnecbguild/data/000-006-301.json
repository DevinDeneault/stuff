      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hail, ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\n It's time to post yet another Henchman build from the OC. This time it's Linu, who was a Sehanine Moonbow Cleric with low DEX, which is kind of cool. She went on to prove herself through Strength and determination, in a different way than most of her sisters. She did become a Champion of Sehanine, and she was quite gentle and charismatic, so Bard came in the mix too. Now at first glance, her build looks like one of those \"born at 40\" builds, but I assure you it's not. She can cast Magic Vestment on a Tower Shield and a Full Plate, drink a Cat's Grace potion, Cast Eagle's Splendor, cast Divine Shield (with some CHA gear this is excellent) and have a higher AC than any meleer. Now there are some unfortunate consequences to the way I built her, which was to take advantage of the CoT bonus feats as Great Wisdom increases as a way to help deal with the fact I needed to invest on 3 stats. So, in pre-epics, she will be a self-buffing meleer and summoner, but she won't be able to cast level 5 spells for a very long time, until she starts getting her Wisdom increases with CoT (yeah, Champion of Sehanine is CoT) feats. That is more of a nuisance than actually a problem, as all your main buffs: (Shield of Faith, Bull's Strength, Eagle's Splendor, Divine Favor, GMW, Darkfire, Magic Vestment and Divine Power) will be available to you and will progress accordingly. You just won't have useful spells like Word of Faith, Harm, Heal, Blade Barrier, etc.. Still, she will manage without, I can guarrantee that!<br/>\n<br/>\n EDIT: forgot to mention XP Penalty from lvl 37 on.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, here she is: Linu La'neral!<br/>\n<br/>\n Cleric(29), Champion of Sehanine(10), Bard(1), Elf<br/>\n<br/>\n Alignment: Any non-lawful<br/>\n<br/>\n Playability: 1-40 PvM<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 14 (26)<br/>\n DEX: 10<br/>\n CON: 12<br/>\n WIS: 14 (20)<br/>\n INT: 14<br/>\n CHA: 14 (18)<br/>\n<br/>\n Elf: (Hardiness vs. Enchantments, Keen Sense, Low-light Vision, Skill Affinity: Listen, Skill Affinity: Search, Skill Affinity: Spot, Sleeplessness)<br/>\n 01: Cleric(1): Expertise, Domain Trickery, Domain Travel<br/>\n 02: Cleric(2)<br/>\n 03: Cleric(3): Weapon Focus: Mace<br/>\n 04: Cleric(4): STR+1, (STR=15)<br/>\n 05: Cleric(5)<br/>\n 06: Cleric(6): Extend Spell<br/>\n 07: Cleric(7)<br/>\n 08: Cleric(8): STR+1, (STR=16)<br/>\n 09: Cleric(9): Knockdown<br/>\n 10: Cleric(10)<br/>\n 11: Cleric(11)<br/>\n 12: Cleric(12): STR+1, Power Attack, (STR=17)<br/>\n 13: Cleric(13)<br/>\n 14: Cleric(14)<br/>\n 15: Cleric(15): Divine Shield<br/>\n 16: Cleric(16): STR+1, (STR=18)<br/>\n 17: Cleric(17)<br/>\n 18: Cleric(18): Divine Might<br/>\n 19: Cleric(19)<br/>\n 20: Champion of Sehanine(1): STR+1, (STR=19)<br/>\n 21: Champion of Sehanine(2): Epic Weapon Focus: Mace, Great Wisdom I, (WIS=15)<br/>\n 22: Champion of Sehanine(3): {Smite Evil}<br/>\n 23: Champion of Sehanine(4): Great Wisdom II, (WIS=16)<br/>\n 24: Champion of Sehanine(5): STR+1, Great Strength I, (STR=21)<br/>\n 25: Champion of Sehanine(6): Great Wisdom III, (WIS=17)<br/>\n 26: Champion of Sehanine(7)<br/>\n 27: Champion of Sehanine(8): Great Strength II, Great Wisdom IV, (STR=22), (WIS=18)<br/>\n 28: Champion of Sehanine(9): STR+1, (STR=23)<br/>\n 29: Champion of Sehanine(10): Epic Prowess<br/>\n 30: Cleric(20): Great Strength III, (STR=24)<br/>\n 31: Cleric(21)<br/>\n 32: Cleric(22): STR+1, (STR=25)<br/>\n 33: Cleric(23): Great Strength IV, Great Wisdom V, (STR=26), (WIS=19)<br/>\n 34: Cleric(24)<br/>\n 35: Cleric(25)<br/>\n 36: Cleric(26): CHA+1, Great Charisma I, Armor Skin, (CHA=16)<br/>\n 37: Bard(1)<br/>\n 38: Cleric(27)<br/>\n 39: Cleric(28): Great Charisma II, (CHA=17)<br/>\n 40: Cleric(29): CHA+1, Great Wisdom VI, (WIS=20), (CHA=18)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 378<br/>\n Skillpoints: 174<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 29/31/23<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9, Mind Effects: +2<br/>\n BAB: 25<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 37 (melee), 26 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 20/31<br/>\n Spell Casting: Cleric(9),Bard(0)<br/>\n Alignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\n Concentration 43(44), Listen 25(32), Open Lock 1(1), Perform 1(5), Spellcraft 43(45), Tumble 40(40), UMD 20(24)<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Concentration(4), Open Lock(1), Spellcraft(4), Save(6),<br/>\n 02: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(8),<br/>\n 03: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(10),<br/>\n 04: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(12),<br/>\n 05: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(14),<br/>\n 06: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(16),<br/>\n 07: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(18),<br/>\n 08: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(20),<br/>\n 09: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(22),<br/>\n 10: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(24),<br/>\n 11: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(26),<br/>\n 12: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(28),<br/>\n 13: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(30),<br/>\n 14: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(32),<br/>\n 15: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(34),<br/>\n 16: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(36),<br/>\n 17: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(38),<br/>\n 18: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(40),<br/>\n 19: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(42),<br/>\n 20: Save(46),<br/>\n 21: Save(50),<br/>\n 22: Save(54),<br/>\n 23: Save(58),<br/>\n 24: Save(62),<br/>\n 25: Save(66),<br/>\n 26: Save(70),<br/>\n 27: Save(74),<br/>\n 28: Save(78),<br/>\n 29: Save(82),<br/>\n 30: Concentration(11), Spellcraft(11), Save(64),<br/>\n 31: Save(68),<br/>\n 32: Save(72),<br/>\n 33: Save(76),<br/>\n 34: Save(80),<br/>\n 35: Save(84),<br/>\n 36: Save(88),<br/>\n 37: Concentration(6), Listen(25), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(40), UMD(20), Save(1),<br/>\n 38: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(3),<br/>\n 39: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(3),<br/>\n 40: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(3),<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Naturally, it would require martial prof. stuffed in there somewhere, but like I said, didn't know how close to an actual representative character you were trying to design.  The power of better crits would enhance it somewhat and standard clerics are renown for wielding crappy weapons. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can't see where such a low Listen skill will do much good and would rather max UMD.  Maybe some trap skills would be more useful since you will have a strong Divine trickery boost.  Also, this seems much more a self-buffing melee build than a close range caster so I would swing all those Conc points over to Discipline.  If the foe wants to taunt, let 'em... just before they die.   With Gtr Sanctuary, you can always disengage and rebuff away from the fray if dispelled, which will be very tough anyway except for Mords.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also defy the \"even final ability\" rule by maxing WIS at 19 and take either Imp KD or Cleave, losing the added slot @level 1 &amp; level 5, a DC (which is fairly pedestrian anyway) and a Will save (which is a small issue for a CoT).  Yes, those suggestions together with electing martial for RP would mean you would be taking non-epic feats in epic but that never stopped me from making a more overall effective build, especially when building a feat-starved class like cleric.  And the max Owl's buff will produce the identical WIS modification (@24 instead of 25) though it would lose the DC/save in a high-magic, capped ability environment.  No big whoop IMO.  Just a few thoughts to consider.<br/>\n<br/>\nPretty accurate perspective and build otherwise, Max.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I wouldn't change that, even so because weapons matter little to a Cleric anyway.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>I can't see where such a low Listen skill will do much good and would rather max UMD.

As for listen, nearly all creatures use Hiding, even if they're not proficient with it, so with this Listen score you detect everyone but the rogue-types, Again, an evironmental thing, you can change it if you want.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>I would also defy the \"even final ability\" rule by maxing WIS at 19 and take either Imp KD or Cleave, losing the added slot @level 1 &amp; level 5, a DC (which is fairly pedestrian anyway) and a Will save (which is a small issue for a CoT).
