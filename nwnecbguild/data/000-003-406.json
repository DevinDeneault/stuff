      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hey ECBG<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for making a great forum.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm toying with a build, but having difficulties placing the levels correct so that I can utilize the cleric spell Divine Power to its fullest (I know its cheasing, but my current PM supports it)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe level disposition of the build would be 20 monk 16 cleric  4 BG. The race would be a dwarf. It's gonna be a strength based build, as I'm focussing on making a strong dev crit build utilising scimitars good crit range. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow for my problem. I want to utilise Divine Power and its magic of adding another attack at full ab without gimping my final BAB too much. I won't get a full extra attack if I take all four levels of BG before level 20 as my BAB will get to 16 and I'll get my fourth attack and divine power does not give me another attack at full ab, it only raises my ab to that of a figther of same level (in this case adding +4 to all my attacks).<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd like to start with a monk lvl to get the benefits of the monks skill points as well as class feats. Then my trouble begins as I'd like to put in a lot of cleric levels for all the nice and helpful buffs, but I'd also like to have some BG levels in there so I get a free martial weapon proficiency. <br/>\n<br/>\nShould I just go for the level placement and ignore that my BAB will be seriously gimped and enjoy the magic of divine power or should I rather go for a normal 4/4/12 build? <br/>\n<br/>\npre-20: 1 mo, 12 cle, 1 bg, 4, cle, 2 mo<br/>\npost-20: 3 bg and rest monk<br/>\n<br/>\nI need some advice on which is best going for the normal 4/4/12 pre-20 or just getting useful feats for free and using divine powers cheasyness and crappy BAB?<br/>\n<br/>\nJaq<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You can't take it until minimum lvl9 and I can't tell if your CHA will be high enough to get a save bonus worth having.  Just take martial prof lvl1 if thats what you want.<br/>\n<br/>\n- This is very PW dependent, but 16 cleric lvls will get dispelled easy if there's any dispelling going on.<br/>\n<br/>\n- If it's empty body and perfect self, you can get the same with trickery domain (Imp Inv) and Clarity from clerics, but again, very environment dependent (same with SR from cleric spell).  I guess what are you going for with the 20 lvls of monk in terms of what's important to you?  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt terms of build, it seems that other than saving throw progression, stopping at monk 6 (KD/IKD) or 9 (Imp evasion) might be beneficial, since most of those other feats can be replicated via clerical spells (healing, SR, concealment, mind effects), although if there's a super high amount of dispelling/mords, that changes things.  <br/>\n<br/>\nalso, with that specific class mix, you're not getting any epic bonus feats, so youre going to need at least 2 for OV and Dev crit, meaning you can only get 5 great str, less since you'll want EWF.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso recognize that while you get Cleave for free, Power Attack is still a requirement so you must take it for Dev Crit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're stuck on that specific class mix - 20 monk, 4 bg, 16 cleric, my first instinct is to go<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">OK, I want to understand something:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- Why are you making a Cleric / Monk if you're not going to use a Kama?<br/>\n2- Cleric / Monks are stronger as DEX builds, so for a STR build, honestly, Monk is being underused. I'd consider getting rid of it. If you're going for STR, then you might be better off just wearing armor. If you want the Wisdom AC, then dex is the way to go because Monk AC only applies when wearing robes. How about something like Cleric 20, BG 4, Bard 16 (for the Song bonus, UMD and CHA buffs). But, going for Devcrit, this build would be feat-starved. You could drop BG and go with Fighter 4 instead for WS / EWS and 2 more feats to help with requirements.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for BAB, not much you can do. Clerics generally have low BAB and AB in general because of having to invest stat points in WISDOM to cast their spells, so the AB comes via buffs. If you get dispelled, it's bad for you, period. Having Bard Song to go with it may be a good idea. The only exception is Mith's Blood &amp; Faith, which has decent stats without buffs on because of RDD STR bonus.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust throwing in some ideas for you. I will try to concoct something for you and then you can make up your mind whether it's worth it or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
