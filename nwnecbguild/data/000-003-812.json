      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi Emptybody, and welcome!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main issue with this is going to be feat starvation. You need 6 feats to qualify for WM (Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack, Expertise and a Weapon Focus in a melee weapon), which leaves you with 2 other pre-epic feats (assuming you're going Human - if you're not, it's 1). That means several things: i) Dev Crit really will be impossible unless you really gimp the build; ii) if you go for even a couple of Cleric feats, then you're stuffed for Imp Crit, Blind Fight and Knockdown; iii) the earliest you'd be able to take WM at all would be at level 13, so your AB isn't going to be exactly stellar; iv) adding a Tumble class will also knock it down further if you want to make use of it pre-epic; v) your choice of weapons will be pretty restricted. There are probably more, but I think you get the idea...<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not saying it's impossible (well, it would be for me), because some of our great and good can work absolute miracles. I am suggesting you don't hold your breath, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n(You just watch, someone will pop up with 12 variations for you now, just to make me look like an idiot.)<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless, happy to have you on board!<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Inevitable ninja-ing from Mick to prove my point!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
