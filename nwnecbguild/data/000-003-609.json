With all that strength, a two handed weapon is very favorable, single handed and shield for extra AC is attractive.<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/202005/10759084_c04f728a09c1040bfd59d8d423ef8b60.jpg\"/><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:50%;line-height:normal\">Image source:\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/96/dc/17/96dc17ab0c92e4c7665f9dc4f3ab4049.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/96/dc/17 ... ab4049.jpg</a></span><br/>\n<br/>\nDev crit can be incorporated by dropping toughness, blind fight, craft wand and two great strengths for power attack, cleave, great cleave, overwhelming critical, devastating critical for the human version, one extra feat to be dropped for improved critical for the half-orc version.<br/>\nDev crit version base Str is 40 (52 capped), mundane AB 44 (half-orc), 43 (human).<br/>\nThe half-orc version can have two higher strength however it loses epic prowess and a lot of skill points (ie out of tumble AC or concentration), the mundane AB is unchanged.<br/>\nThe human version has discipline but the half-orc version doesn't. A source of knockdown immunity will be mandatory for the human version up to level 30 and the half-orc version all levels.\u00a0<br/>\nEven with max discipline I use knockdown immunity if I have it. No discipline makes one vulnerable to disarm attempts.\u00a0<br/>\n20% exp penalty from lvl 30 onwards for the half-orc version. No penalties for humans.<br/>\nSome delay with obtaining cleric spells to get the strength this high. Level 7 cleric spells at 23, level 8 spells at 26, level 9 cleric spells at 29.\u00a0<br/>\nScrolls could be used until then if you have access to them.<br/>\nI believe there could be very nice synergy with the ultra-high strength and melee touch attack AB for harm (or heal against undead) spell attempts.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Cleric(29), Bard(1), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Half-Orc\nPvM 1-40, low-mid magic\nSTR: 19 (42)\nCON: 9 (11)\nINT: 12 (14)\n\n01: Cleric(1): Weapon Proficiency Martial, Domain Travel, Domain Trickery\n03: Cleric(3): Silent Spell\n05: Cleric(5)\n07: Cleric(7)\n09: Cleric(9): Knockdown\n11: Cleric(11)\n13: Cleric(13)\n15: Cleric(15): Weapon Focus: Heavy Flail\n17: Cleric(17)\n19: Cleric(19)\n21: Cleric(21): Epic Weapon Focus: Heavy Flail\n23: Cleric(23): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=17)\n25: Cleric(25)\n27: Cleric(27): Epic Prowess\n29: Cleric(29): Great Wisdom III, (WIS=19)\n31: Red Dragon Disciple(1)\n33: Red Dragon Disciple(3): Great Strength III, (STR=32)\n35: Red Dragon Disciple(5)\n37: Red Dragon Disciple(7): (CON=11)\n39: Red Dragon Disciple(9): Great Strength V, (STR=37), (INT=14)\n\nSkillpoints: 132\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +2\nAB (max, naked): 45 (melee), 25 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Cleric(9)\n\n\n01: Concentration(4), Lore(4), Spellcraft(4),\u00a0\n03: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1),\u00a0\n05: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n07: Concentration(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n09: Concentration(1), Save(9),\u00a0\n11: Concentration(1), Save(13),\u00a0\n13: Concentration(1), Save(17),\u00a0\n15: Concentration(1), Save(21),\u00a0\n17: Concentration(1), Save(25),\u00a0\n19: Concentration(1), Save(29),\u00a0\n21: Save(34),\u00a0\n23: Save(40),\u00a0\n25: Save(46),\u00a0\n27: Save(52),\u00a0\n29: Save(58),\u00a0\n31: Search(3),\u00a0\n33: Search(2), Spellcraft(1),\u00a0\n35: Concentration(3),\u00a0\n37: Concentration(3),\u00a0\n39: Concentration(3),\u00a0</details>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Cleric(29), Bard(1), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Human\nPvM 1-40, low-mid magic\nSTR: 18 (42)\nCON: 8 (10)\nINT: 12 (14)\n\n01: Cleric(1): Blind Fight, Weapon Proficiency Martial, Domain Travel, Domain Trickery\n03: Cleric(3): Silent Spell\n05: Cleric(5)\n07: Cleric(7)\n09: Cleric(9): Knockdown\n11: Cleric(11)\n13: Cleric(13)\n15: Cleric(15): Weapon Focus: Heavy Flail\n17: Cleric(17)\n19: Cleric(19)\n21: Cleric(21): Epic Weapon Focus: Heavy Flail\n23: Cleric(23): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=17)\n25: Cleric(25)\n27: Cleric(27): Great Strength II, (STR=26)\n29: Cleric(29): Great Wisdom III, (WIS=19)\n31: Red Dragon Disciple(1)\n33: Red Dragon Disciple(3): Great Strength IV, (STR=32)\n35: Red Dragon Disciple(5)\n37: Red Dragon Disciple(7): (CON=10)\n39: Red Dragon Disciple(9): Great Strength VI, (STR=37), (INT=14)\n\nSkillpoints: 175\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +4\nAB (max, naked): 44 (melee), 24 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Cleric(9)\n\n\n01: Concentration(4), Lore(4), Spellcraft(4), Save(4),\u00a0\n03: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(6),\u00a0\n05: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Save(9),\u00a0\n07: Concentration(1), Save(15),\u00a0\n09: Concentration(1), Save(21),\u00a0\n11: Concentration(1), Save(27),\u00a0\n13: Concentration(1), Save(33),\u00a0\n15: Concentration(1), Save(39),\u00a0\n17: Concentration(1), Save(45),\u00a0\n19: Concentration(1), Save(51),\u00a0\n21: Save(58),\u00a0\n23: Save(66),\u00a0\n25: Save(74),\u00a0\n27: Save(82),\u00a0\n29: Save(90),\u00a0\n31: Discipline(1), Search(3),\u00a0\n33: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Search(2),\u00a0\n35: Concentration(2), Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1),\u00a0\n37: Concentration(3), Discipline(1),\u00a0\n39: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(3),\u00a0</details></div>"

      "content": "<div>Hey blackfeltfedora<br/>\nThanks for your comments!<br/>\nI myself have only playtested this to lvl 7 on WoG (like you I chose the half-orc because why not, have a warriors 45 AB on a cleric with a lvl 9 spell book), it is extremely powerful compared to other cleric builds I have playtested.<br/>\nI am not familiar with Soulforge but the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://soulforge.world/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=Information+and+Introduction\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wiki</a>\u00a0seems to indicate it is a pretty awesome place, a PW running for over a decade, going to lvl 40!\u00a0\u00a0excellent choice to play test this as it gains 5 strength at level 40!\u00a0Even says the players + characters who are on. Is\u00a0Vurg the Tainted this build? Cool name!<br/>\nRE the low CON it is something to manage for sure.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThings I found helpful:<br/>\nFighting enemies one by one by pulling them with a ranged weapon.<br/>\nUsing summons to help with tank for you, which you can do from the beginning. If you are worried about dying in a single crit hit then equip a ranged weapon until your HP is higher.\u00a0<br/>\nEntropic shield is handy against ranged attacks before you get improved invisibility.<br/>\nClerics have the endurance spell, which can boost HP up.<br/>\nSingle handed weapon and shield early pre-epic levels (ie before lvl 12), the extra AC just helps, clerics can buff the tower shield up to a +5 tower shield. (Part of the reason why I put the weapon focus feat a little later the other reason clerics also have lots of ways to boost AB)<br/>\nOnce you get a lot of strength and HP I think two handed will be better in 1v1 situations or against spellcasters\u00a0due to the +1.5x strength modifier damage. Switch to shield and one handed when one has to tank or deal with mobs.\u00a0<br/>\nThere are great spell strategies too.<br/>\nDarkness / Ultravision with melee mobs without ultravision. With improved invisibility: attack miss chance 50%, 50% concealment, plus you get AB bonuses against them, the AI can't detect you so well helping with the 1v1 strategy.\u00a0<br/>\nHammer of the gods is a great party friendly AoE ability against low will save opponents who are not mind immune.<br/>\nWord of Faith, blinding mobs for a decent duration with no save (when you get it), is another outstanding strategy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Dev crit is not essential at all, in fact probably weakens the build with all the pre-requisite feats in my opinion, blind fight, toughness, etc are all very important feats. I think you're going to be killing them without it, but its there as an option because some players will want dev crit with all that strength and huge AB boosts from cleric but I think dev crit actually makes it harder :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHope all this helps!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Yep that was me, was able to tag along in a good party to 20 which always helps. SF modified Dev Crit, not as good as an instant kill but the KD/Haste combo is a nice bonus (no perma-haste items on the server). Once I get STR to 25 and WIS to 19 I'm going to throw a point in CON. I think getting all those RDD goodies late in the build will keep things interesting.\n<table class=\"post_content_table\"><tbody><tr><td>A dev crit knocks the target down for 9 seconds (1.5 rounds) if \\it is not immune to knock down, deals extra physical damage of the type the weapon does, and gives the attacker haste for 5 rounds.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>The extra damage is\u00a0critical multiplier x 33, the WM feat is taken into account. The haste effect will not replace haste spells from other sources.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table></div>"
