It's workable in there, but you do need to take it before you take the first level of BG. I suppose Still Spell goes down the hill in this case, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd also swap Armor Skin with EWF and EWF with EP. At that level you'll hardly be needing AB as much as you'll need AC. Basically, I'd take AS first, then EWF, then EP. I would also go for a 1-handed weapon in this toon. I know 2-handed does A LOT more damage, but you don't have PM levels to be immune to crits, nor do you have any means of increasing your AC except Bard Song (you don't take Divine Shield), which doesn't kick in until much later in the build. Maybe you can take WF in a weapon like Warhammer (bludgeoning), and carry a very welcome shield to increase your survivability and carry around a Greatsword as a backup weapon. Then you could drop Improved Critical for IKD or Expertise. I'd go with Expertise for the combo with Taunt. Last, I'd keep Discipline over Taunt and drop Spellcraft. IMO for this build, Taunting is more useful than saves vs spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">And i was happy with my newfounded bonus feat :/<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me fix that and take upon some of your suggestions as well Max.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMoghedien is now focused in Scimitars which allows her the use of a T. Shield and thus advancing even more her already incredible AC. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe retains her KD and Still Spell feats so she can cast while in combat and don't have to undress each time she wants to cast a spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe retains the order of the Epic Feats (offensive first) because the T. Shield gave her the additional AC she might needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith her ability to keen her Scimitar all day long the critical threat range is now 15-20 equal to a keen Greatsword with the Improved Critical feat, that's enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nDivin Shield and Expertise feats are not needed. The reason for that is that Moghedien with a very conservative +5 equipment can reach an incredible 74 AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoreover the use of Divine Shield would easily make her hit the Dodge Cap and thus not utilising the extra AC to the fullest.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaunt skill can and should be selected in place of Discipline, she will probably be clad in KD immune gear (UMD) or her AC will be so high that the enemies won't use KD on her at all, (I have seen that in multiple occasions).<br/>\n<br/>\nDropping Spellcraft which offers her a massive (+10 bonus to all her saves Vs spells) in favor of Taunt though is not an option.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf nothing else her AB is so sky high that she doesn't need Taunt at all, these tricks are best suited to less powerful toons. Her, with an operational 68 AB won't need it, but if you want to have it then take it in place of Discipline.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMany people (not the vet's) will hear me talking about all these massive numbers and wondering how is that possible with this character, she is just a Bard, right? <br/>\n<br/>\nJust three examples to see what i am talking about in a modest +5 environment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMoghedien AC: 10 (base) + 8 (tumble) + 2 (AS) + 4 (RDD) + 4 (haste) + 13 (plate +5) + 8 (T. shield +5) + 1 (cat's) + 6 (26th lvl song) + 2 (curse song) + 1 (m. armour) + 5 (amulet +5) + 5 (ring +5) + 5 (sun soul +5 via umd) =<strong> 74 AC</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nMoghedien AB: 26 (base) + 21 (buffed STR) + 4 (focusses) + 2 (Bard Song) + 6 (Curse Song) + 2 (War Cry) + 2 (aid+bless potions) + 5 (Scimitar +5) + 6 (Taunt - if taken) = <strong>74 AB</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nMoghedien Taunt Skill: 43 Ranks + 9 (buffed CHA) + 15 (26th lvl Bard Song) + 15 (26th lvl Curse Song) = <strong>82 Taunt</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nMost impressive is the fact that for these numbers you won't even need special equipment or massive buffing. Almost everything comes from herself and is undispellable except from Mord's, and Bard Song isn't dispellable at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the <strong>Final Version </strong>of the build.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>MOGHEDIEN \u2013 Melody of the Dark</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>(BARD 26/ BG 4/ RDD 10)</strong> <br/>\n<br/>\nRACE: Human Female<br/>\n<br/>\nALIGNMENT: Neutral Evil<br/>\n<br/>\nPLAYABILITY: PvM 1-40<br/>\n<br/>\nSTARTING STATS:<br/>\nSTR - 18<br/>\nDEX - 08<br/>\nCON - 14<br/>\nINT - 10<br/>\nWIS - 08<br/>\nCHA - 14<br/>\n<br/>\nENDING STATS:<br/>\nSTR - 40<br/>\nDEX - 08<br/>\nCON - 16<br/>\nINT - 12<br/>\nWIS - 08<br/>\nCHA - 16<br/>\n<br/>\nBASIC STATS:<br/>\n<br/>\nHit Points: 400<br/>\n<br/>\nSkill Points: 206<br/>\n<br/>\nHide: 5 (4) \u2192 {13}<br/>\nLore: 8 (35) \u2192 {43}<br/>\nPerform: 43 (56) \u2192 {65}<br/>\nTumble: 40 (39) \u2192 {48}<br/>\nSpellcraft: 40 (41) \u2192 {50}<br/>\nTaunt: 43 (46) {55} OR Discipline: 43 (58) \u2192 {67}<br/>\nUMD: 27 (30) \u2192 {39}<br/>\n<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fort/Ref/Will): 28/ 21/ 25 \u2192 40/ 34/ 38 (saves Vs spells with Bard Song)<br/>\n<br/>\nNaked AC: 23/ 34/ 41 (Naked/ Plate Mail/ Plate Mail &amp; Song &amp; Cat's)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBAB: 26 (Four Attacks/ Round)<br/>\n<br/>\nAB: +45/ +40/ +35/ +30 \u2192  +47/ +42/ +37/ +32 (Bard Song) \u2013 (Scimitar)<br/>\n<br/>\nDMG: 1D6 + 15 / 18-20 x2 \u2192 1D6 +18 / 18-20 x2 (Bard Song) \u2013 (Scimitar)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSpellcasting: Bard 6th Circle level of spells plus full UMD<br/>\n<br/>\nBlackguard Bull's Strength 1/Day (stack-able)<br/>\n<br/>\nBard Song 26 uses/ Day each one lasts for 100 Rounds \u2013 Same goes for Curse Song<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLEVELING GUIDE:<br/>\n<br/>\n01) BARD (01): Power Attack, Cleave<br/>\n02) BARD (02):<br/>\n03) BARD (03): Curse Song<br/>\n04) BARD (04):<br/>\n05) BARD (05):<br/>\n06) BARD (06): Still Spell<br/>\n07) BARD (07):<br/>\n08) BARD (08):<br/>\n09) BG (01): Knockdown<br/>\n10) BG (02):<br/>\n11) BG (03):<br/>\n12) BG (04): Divine Might<br/>\n13) RDD (01):<br/>\n14) RDD (02):<br/>\n15) RDD (03): Blind Fighting<br/>\n16) RDD (04):<br/>\n17) RDD (05):<br/>\n18) RDD (06): WF: Scimitar<br/>\n19) RDD (07):<br/>\n20) RDD (08):<br/>\n21) RDD (09): EWF: Scimitar<br/>\n22) RDD (10):<br/>\n23) BARD (09):<br/>\n24) BARD (10): Epic Prowess<br/>\n25) BARD (11):<br/>\n26) BARD (12):<br/>\n27) BARD (13): Armor Skin<br/>\n28) BARD (14):<br/>\n29) BARD (15):<br/>\n30) BARD (16): Great Strength I<br/>\n31) BARD (17):<br/>\n32) BARD (18):<br/>\n33) BARD (19): Great Strength II<br/>\n34) BARD (20):<br/>\n35) BARD (21):<br/>\n36) BARD (22): Great Strength III<br/>\n37) BARD (23): Lasting Inspiration<br/>\n38) BARD (24):<br/>\n39) BARD (25): Great Strength IV<br/>\n40) BARD (26): ESF: Perform<br/>\n<br/>\nSPECIAL NOTES:<br/>\n<br/>\nBard Song at 21st level gives 2 AB/ 3 DMG/ 2 Fort/ 3 Ref/ 3 Will/ 5 AC/ 30 HP's / 9 to all Skills<br/>\n<br/>\nBard Song at 26th level gives 2AB/ 3DMG/ 2 Fort/ 3 Ref/ 3 Will / 6AC/ 40 HP's / 15 to all skills<br/>\n<br/>\nBard Curse Song subtracts  all these from your opponents<br/>\n<br/>\nDivine Might gives 3 DMG/ 3 Rounds \u2192 9 DMG/ 9 Rounds (Buffed CHA)<br/>\n<br/>\nMoghedien is immune to Fire, Paralysis, Sleep and has Darkvision<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*Thanks for your input and constructive critisism Max, this is exactly how it should be done and i feel that Moghedien is stronger by a lot now!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You will also notice that i purposely avoided going the dev crit route there, although i already was forced to take two of the pre-requisite feats, cause that would make her totaly ridiculous, at least in an environment that the feat is allowed as is. For that modification, i would probably take out AS and two great STR's and fit in there IC/OW/DEV critical. Then with a buffed 50 Str plus Curse song i would proceed to deliver DC 52 Dev Crits from 12-20 all over the place... But it gets boring after a while, that's why i try many times to do something without it, much like i don't use (TS/2X Max IGMS + TS/ 3X Emp IGMS) to instant-kill every Boss.<br/>\n<br/>\n I pretty much agree with you with the split of this build, mostly because in PW's at some point it stops to be about yourself and becomes more about the \"party\", and that's why we play in PW's right? To play with other people as well, so a Bard's awesome all-day-long song boosts everyone's abilities and for that you need an epic Bard. That's why Bard 24/26 is always a \"must\" in my book, when design a toon like that. The other two classes can differ as much as they want, but as long as you have the epic song/curse, you are doing it right.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks for your comments, much appreciated ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

In modules which allow alignment change it could be pretty simple to shift from NE to TN once you have done with your Blackguard levels, at level 12. I've recently done a bit of research and posted in our game guides section of the forum into the practical aspects of alignment changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly Valerfor's build allows the player 12 levels (Bard 8, Blackguard 4) to make your alignment borderline NE (ie Neutral (50) Evil (29)), which is like, one and a half whole modules. You might achieve this goal early, you can just then\u00a0then just hover there at that alignment getting ready to shift once you have done with Blackguard. You could very feasibly achieve this in a popular module such as Aielund Act 1 and Act 2.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you get Blackguard 4 you can just have a Good shifting conversational option and suddenly your alignment has shifted from Neutral (50) Evil (29) to True Neutral (50, 50). And now Moghedien is 'Smite proof'.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoghedien could even go on to be 'reformed' to be a good character as the modules progress as you retain your blackguard abilities with this shift (just not the ability to further level BG, which you no longer need after you get Bull's Strength, Divine Might and Dark Blessing!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the only issue would be if certain servers or module dont allow such alignment changes in characters to load into them. Then you could just simply disregard what I've written<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway just in case you wanted to make this overpowered\u00a0build even stronger to make yourself 'smite' proof.\u00a0Feel free to check the\u00a0NWN Wiki on alignment and/or my post if this is confusing.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Level 28 right now. I ended up not using still spell all that much. Mostly took off armor for buffs before fights. Then both songs/ divine might. Sometimes a stilled wounding whispers or amplify. Always felt I din\u2019t have enough spell slots and would miss out. Now that I feel i got enough to use still spell, I find a bard armor with permahaste and -% spell failure :/<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only fight that was pretty hard was the early wyvern fight. Really enjoying this build!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
