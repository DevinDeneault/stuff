      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hi all - <br/>\n<br/>\nlong time listener, first time caller<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I'm really here to advertise and extend an invitation. Neversummer 4 is a long-standing PvP/PvE persistent world that just made the transition to NWN Enhanced Edition. The hallmark and aspiration of the server is balanced PvP, with six home factions that each offer their own strengths, weaknesses, and playing styles (nature focused, divine, mages, dwarven, dragons, and drow). The server is in the NWN server list as Neversummer 4 EE, or you can direct connect via ns4.ns4ee.com.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe server itself is huge with over 600 areas, including areas for pre-epic and epic adventuring. Lots and lots of custom content in service to balance, so this is not vanilla NWN - most spells, all gear and creatures, and a lot of feat, class, and racial attributes are custom. The modifications are too numerous to mention for a post, but there is a wiki, a website, and a Discord channel with lots and lots of info.\u00a0 I can tell you we love talking builds, and I myself have turned to the ECB boards for inspiration and help in starting builds to play in NS4. Just a general flavor of some of the broader changes:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. All prestige classes, a couple main classes, and any classes taken in epics requires a minimum of 5 levels to be taken<br/>\n2. Each faction has a prestige class that is unique to its faction (for instance, only players in the Ragnar's Kin faction can make a dwarven defender).<br/>\n3. Factions have other limitations in classes, races, and/or alignments, and there are no alignment changes, so you can't make, for example, a paladin/PM<br/>\n4. Subraces<br/>\n5. Reining in of super-abilities like HIPS and stunning fist<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we get is parties of paladins and divine warriors facing off and well-matched against mages, assassins, and undead masters. Battles that literally range across the server. Parties leveling and challenged by epic monsters. Events where you work with your allies to achieve victory and dominance.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I invite you to check it out. Links are below, and please feel free to PM me if I can help. We look forward to new friends .... and foes <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\nWebsite: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://ns4ee.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ns4ee.com</a><br/>\nWiki: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://ns4ee.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ns4ee.com/wiki</a><br/>\nDiscord: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://discord.com/channels/697924719084568676/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Neversummer Enhanced</a><br/>\nDirect connect: ns4.ns4ee.com:5121<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I definitely recommend checking out NS4. It was one of my favourite servers in 1.69 and very little has changed in the EE version. Challenging PvM from 1-40 and the most balanced PvP environment I've ever played in (although there are still some OP builds). Due to the various faction restrictions and custom changes I find theory building for NS4 more interesting\u00a0compared to vanilla NWN.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing to mention in addition to frogofpeace's post is that it's possible to add a permanent +2 or +4 bonus to abilities with books found in monster loot. So in addition to subrace ability changes you could potentially get +4 to all six abilities, although realistically you'll be using +2 books rather than +4 books. As well as increasing the level of build customisation this also makes it possible to create decent builds that are terrible or even impossible to make in vanilla NWN.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

After getting to level 20 there's no solo areas where i would keep dying all the time. I was told that people have zerg groups once a week but i'd like a solo option too. I guess there's not gonna be solo friendly lvl 20+ areas?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yea, also is the server the same as before? I have a huge lag from Europe.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Although the highest character I have in NS4 EE is only 27, most things are the same as 1.69 so I think I have a rough idea of how levelling is in EE. Generally 1-30 is easy and can be done solo with no problem, assuming that you know where to go. 30-35 can be done solo with the right build but it's much quicker and\u00a0safer with a party. 35-40 is a choice between waiting for a party or a very very long solo grind.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 20 I usually solo in either Frostdale or Sunken Isle, although with a decent build or party I might try harder areas like Skara or Isle Of Dreams.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I was able to kill arctic wolves, but they're only cr16 according to website. Sunken Isle had some mobs right off the portal that had spell resistance or something, my druid couldn't get 10 meters before dying. Was there gnolls or something that you do after city guards? They weren't over cr 20 either if i remember right. Anyways, if devs still worked on this mod, i'd make it more solo levelling friendly, even if it's slow levelling, it still would be better than quitting.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Ice Efreets give decent XP although you'll need a lot of Cold DI/DR. There are trolls in Frostdale too but I've never liked levelling there. Sunken Isle is fairly easy for it's CR value, plus it has decent loot if you can kill the bosses. The Merfolk Fishermen have Stunning Fist and Quivering Palm, but as long as you wear the right DR gear none of the mobs in the first area should give you any trouble. Especially if you're a Druid with summons.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Ice efreets are all bludgeon damage, too, so equip a bludge shield and bludge armor. I don't like ice trolls, either, but some people do.<br/>\n<br/>\nRide the dragon outside avendell to western slope and head north for mezzosomethings (we just call them mezzos :P) - ant-creatures. Not quite as good xp as efreets, but can get you another couple levels after 20, depending on your ECL. Or go south from western slope to find gnolls - same comment as mezzos.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo things about NS4: first, it's all about damage resists - pay attention to the type of damage the mob is doing, both physical and elemental. Most armors have physical damage resistance and immunity - equip appropriately, and use buff spells for more DR.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second is the summons are your friends: Summon Creature, Planar Binding, Gate, Dragon Knight, Mummy Dust are heavily modified. Summons vary by alignment, race, and spell foci of the caster, but can really help. Druid spells in particular are very summons friendly and give lots of options (elemental form is pretty nice, too).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
