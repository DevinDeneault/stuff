      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">So why Bard and not Wizard, then? At least with higher INT, rather than CHA, you'll be getting more skill points to distribute. And if you wanted to go DEX, Elf would give you a boost with no xp penalty (although xbow might not be the best weapon choice).<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm not a player of arcanists, let alone builder of them, so I'll leave that for those in the know. But I've had a furtle around in the Build Database and Legacy Archive and found a few Monk/Wiz/PM builds (some DEX, some STR). Alas, they're all level 40 builds, and all take a full Monk schedule pre-epic, followed by 3 levels of Wiz then 16 of PM, with a final Monk dump at level 40. This might not be necessarily true, but it seems to point to there being potential difficulty squeezing all the potential benefits into 30 levels. Just a cautionary note. But, as I say, I'm no arcanist...<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
