      "content": "<div>G'day All,<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm playing a Druid 24/Monk 8/Rogue 8 build on the City of Melnibone PW. It is based on the KailPendragon's Oerthblood. If it works on the low-magic PW at epic levels then I'll post it here for comment and refinement. The primary aim of the build is an Archer (WF/EWF: composite shortbow), Caster (spell foci: evocation) and a high wisdom score. Rogue skills add the ability to deal with locks and traps. Melee consists of using Animal Companions or other players as meat shields, using the Stoneskin wild/elemental shape combo to briefly tank, or simply relying on Monk speed, Tumble and Discipline to avoid Boss sock puppet time and run away.<br/>\n<br/>\nA downside is a feat-starved build. I only have one slot available for metamagic and I'm not sure what to take. I am leaning towards Extend Spell, just to extend those buffs, but would another metamagic feat be more appropriate for an Archer/Caster?<br/>\n<br/>\nOr perhaps skipping metamagic altogether and use that extra feat slot for improved critcal: shortbow?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for your suggestions :-)</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hi SnorriHT<br/>\nGreat you are interested in Druid / Monk / Rogue builds, they are an underexplored class combination.\u00a0<br/>\nThere is excellent synergy between the classes with the amount of skill points Druids obtain + monk wisdom AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know you asked GDL, but if it helps, Weapon Finesse is also bit of a mystery to me in Oerthblood, my only thought is to boost the AB of a high Dex polymorph form such as the Elder Air Elemental Form, but Kail being an experienced builder may have had his reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the build to improve playability I would prioritise in order of leveling Druid &gt; Rogue &gt; Monk. Great idea to start with Rogue 1 for the skill points + starting rogue skills. I would then pump Druid and only take your first Monk level after you get Wildshape with Druid 5+, and it doesn't have to be straight away, the more powerful summons and spells you can cast, the easier it will be to level.\u00a0<br/>\nI do worry about damage with your ranged weapon. I suspect a lot of it will come from sneak attacks.<br/>\nDruids have some of the best AoE disabling spells in the game.<br/>\nIf I were to choose a spell focus, I would choose Conjuration for Stonehold/SoV/Grease Combo<br/>\nIf you are ok with it, you could go for a Druid 24 / Rogue 9 / Monk 7 split, it gives you a little more sneak attack damage with the shortbow for perhaps 1-2 levels of 20% exp penalty.\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>\nIf you want to use a heavy crossbow over a shortbow, Rapid Reload is an attractive feat.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for other Druid Monk Rogue builds, I did quite a bit homework on these having played one to level 40:<br/>\n<br/>\nECB Tapatalk Forum:<br/>\n-\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-skilled-and-sneaky-draconian-arch-druid-ssd-dr-t2355112.html#p15800\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Skilled and Sneaky Draconian Arch-Druid</a> (Druid 36 / Monk 1 / Rogue 3) by myself, apologies for the wall of text in advance<br/>\n- <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/nimble-mystic-dragon-druid-28-monk-9-rogue-3-t2354876.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Caliax's Nimble Mystic Dragon</a> (Druid 28 / Monk 9 / Rogue 3)<br/>\n- <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/druid-monk-rogue-ideas-t2354773.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">VonMord's D32/M5/Ro3</a> build<br/>\n<br/>\nECB Archives:<br/>\n- <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build117712.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sharpdog's D20/M12/Ro8</a> build<br/>\n- <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build246355.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Shadow's Breath</a> D20/Ro13/M7<br/>\n- <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build196069.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shadowy Dragon</a> D14/M1/Ro25<br/>\n-\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build200033.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Equaliser</a> (D15/M6/R19)<br/>\n-\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build310681.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Perfect Combatant</a> (D26/R13/M1)<br/>\n-\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build230606.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nimble Dragon</a> (D30/M9/R1)\u00a0<br/>\n-\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build152600.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dragon Slinger</a> (D20/R13/M7)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to which one might be the most helpful for a combat druid zen archer I cannot say<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for skills, I would try to put UMD 33 modified, Tumble 40 and some points in set trap into the build (between 1 to 11 modified, one with the land can add +4 to set trap to help you get to deadly fire/electrical traps setting with modified set trap 15 outside of combat without failure).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nOther skills I find hard to comment on without knowing the environment. If you are truly in a low magic environment you will not need that many points in Lore. A modified lore score of 20 will allow you to identify items <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Lore\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">up to a value of 50,000gp</a>, perhaps that would be enough? I like discipline in polymorph builds to prevent your polymorphed form (ie Bear, Elemental) being knocked down if you don't have a Thieves Hood with Knockdown Immunity. Only Head, Armor and Shield magical properties transfer into Druid forms.</div>"

      "content": "<div>I agree with\u00a0Orion2019 that you should choose Conjuration over Evocation for your focus. Flame Lash is nice but all Druid Evocation spells can be blocked by Evasion and so, depending on your environment, they aren't a good choice for a solo focus Druid build. Conjuration hits both Reflex and Will saves, plus the spells ignore Spellcraft bonuses. It can even be useful while shifted since the major spells are persistent AoEs.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you only have room for one metamagic feat then I would recommend Silent Spell over Extend Spell. Extend Spell is nice but not essential for Druids, since most Druid buffs are either Hours/Level or Turns/Level.\u00a0You miss out on extended Blood Frenzy (L3), extended Regenerate (L7), extended AoV (L8), and extended AoEs (L2 and L7), but in return you get better spellbook management. Generally level 8 spells are the weakest high level Druid spells, I usually fill those slots with either silent Harms/Heals or maximized Ice Storms. If you drop PBS or Toughness for another metamagic feat then I would recommend either Empower Spell or Maximize Spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapon Finesse does work on creature weapons, Air Elemental is the only reason to take Weapon Finesse in that build.</div>"

      "content": "<div>SnorriHT,<br/>\nI like Extend Spell more then Silent. It's been a while, but that pesky level 8 slot can be filled by Extended Creeping Doom, right? As a frequent wizard, it's one of the spells I envy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, I made an modified build. Changes:<br/>\n- Four additional Druid levels for more caster levels, Infinite Elemental Shape, and another epic bonus feat.<br/>\n- Two less Rogue levels. Loss of 1d6 Sneak Attack.<br/>\n- Two less Monk levels. Loss of Wholeness of Body and reduces unarmed damage from 1d10 to 1d8<br/>\n- Restructure of the Monk levels dropped Discipline to 26 ranks, I consider this the worst draw-back of the build<br/>\n- SF: Evocation to SF: Conjuration<br/>\n- Dropped WF: Shortbow<br/>\n- Picked up Craft Wand<br/>\n- Moved Blind Fight up to character level 1<br/>\n- Dropped ESF: Evocation for Great Wisdom<br/>\n- Dropped EWF: Shortbow for Great Wisdom<br/>\n- Dropped Dragon Form because you said the environment doesn't allow it; if it does, drop Epic Prowess for Dragon Form<br/>\n- Moved the final level of Rogue out to character level 40 for a massive skill dump<br/>\n- Moved up Monk 6 for KD/IKD and another +10% move speed earlier<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease keep in mind that with Zen Archery, even though this build drops both WF/EWF: Shortbow, it gets a net +1 AB with shortbow due to the higher Wisdom score. It also gains +3 AC. When this build has Owl's Insight up (should be all the time), it casts Storm of Vengance at DC 42.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne note about Set Trap: Deadly traps can all be set with 15 modified ranks. The next step up is Epic traps at DC 65, which would require 45 modified ranks. This build could hit that, but it would cost another 30 ranks in Set Trap.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don't like UMD, drop it for something you do like.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Rogue(6), Monk(6), Druid(28), Human\nSTR: 10\nCON: 12\nINT: 14\n\n01: Rogue(1): Point Blank Shot, Blind Fight\n03: Druid(2): Toughness\n05: Druid(4)\n07: Monk(1): {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}\n09: Druid(6): Craft Wand\n11: Monk(3)\n13: Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}\n15: Druid(9): Spell Focus: Conjuration\n17: Druid(10)\n19: Druid(11)\n21: Monk(5): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=24)\n23: Monk(6): {Knockdown, Improved Knockdown}\n25: Druid(14)\n27: Druid(16): Great Wisdom II, (WIS=26)\n29: Druid(18)\n31: Druid(20)\n33: Druid(22): Great Wisdom IV, (WIS=30)\n35: Druid(24): Great Wisdom V, (WIS=31)\n37: Druid(26)\n39: Druid(28): Great Wisdom VII, Great Wisdom VIII, (WIS=35)\n\nSkillpoints: 337\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8, Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +1, Fear: +2\nAB (max, naked): 26 (melee), 39 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Druid(9)\n\n\n01: Disable Trap(4), Heal(4), Lore(4), Open Lock(4), Search(4), Set Trap(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(12),\u00a0\n03: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Save(17),\u00a0\n05: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(19),\u00a0\n07: Concentration(1), Discipline(6), Lore(1), Save(23),\u00a0\n09: Concentration(2), Save(5),\u00a0\n11: Concentration(1), Discipline(8), Save(9),\u00a0\n13: Disable Trap(5), Open Lock(3), Search(5), Set Trap(2), Tumble(5), UMD(5), Save(1),\u00a0\n15: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5), Save(2),\u00a0\n17: Concentration(1), Save(9),\u00a0\n19: Concentration(2), Save(5),\u00a0\n21: Concentration(1), Discipline(5), Save(7),\u00a0\n23: Concentration(2), Discipline(2), Save(3),\u00a0\n25: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(10),\u00a0\n27: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(20),\u00a0\n29: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(30),\u00a0\n31: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(40),\u00a0\n33: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(50),\u00a0\n35: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(60),\u00a0\n37: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(70),\u00a0\n39: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(80),\u00a0\n</details>\n\u00a0EDIT: Stag's suggestion.</div>"

One can then put Str to 14, Con to 14, helps with encumbrance and adds some mighty damage to the bow which I believe SnorriHT told us was a problem in his/her environment.<br/>\n- With the extra HP drop toughness and I would be sorely tempted to also drop two great wisdoms and take WF/EWF: Ranged and Improved Critical: Unarmed with the extra feats<br/>\n- Ending Wis is 32 (which will be 44 most of the time). Base Ranged AB is 40, a warriors AB<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for extend vs silent, I think extend would be better in what you have written given a large proportion of druid level investment is epic levels due to rushing Monk 6, it enhances play-ability early levels</div>"

      "content": "<div>To expound upon Orion's very reasonable suggestions, another option would be ESF: Conjuration as the epic feat taken instead of the other Great Wisdom. To reiterate, this would drop Toughness and two Great Wisdoms for WF/EWF: Shortbow and either IC: Unarmed or ESF: Conjuration.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I would have to know the environment to decide between the WIS 36 and STR 14/CON14. Most environments, I'd probably go with the WIS 36, but if low levels and carry capacity is a problem (particularly if henchmen aren't available), STR14/CON14 might be the best option.<br/>\n<br/>\nExamples:<br/>\nSOU/HOTU, WIS 36<br/>\nInfinite Dungeons module, STR14/CON14</div>"

      "content": "<div>Thank you all your suggestions and your hard work. I am just amazed how knowledgeable and giving you everyone is here :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe build environment on the City of Melnibone is tough:<br/>\n- Minimum of 3 levels to access class specific gear (i.e. you can X/Y/Monk 1 but you can't use any Monk specific gear because you only have one level of Monk);<br/>\n- Can only save up to 12 skill points per level;<br/>\n- Can only dump up to 7 points per level into a skill;<br/>\n<br/>\nSo skill dumping is limited. I tried it in the CBC but I just can't get enough Set Traps points, so Tumble was increased to 30 instead. It would have been possible if I had 4 points in Set traps at Level 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am playing the original build on the server and levels 1-3 were brutal. It would have been easier had I gone Rogue 1 (with Set Traps), followed by 5 Druid levels then Monk 1. The original build is now at level 8 and things are good.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom level 9 onwards I'll be going with a Druid 26 / Monk 6 / Rogue 8 build. The last rogue level is at 40, so the xp penalty is a moot point. Other changes are:\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n- WF replaced with Rapid reload. There are a lot of custom Crossbows which are typically added to the loot pile; so they're mine now :-)<br/>\n- EWF, Epic Prowess and Dragon Shape replaced with Great Wisdom<br/>\n- Druid 26 allows Infinite Elemental Shape, which will be very handy in a low magic world<br/>\n- Changed Spell Foci to Conjuration<br/>\n- Retained Extend Spell<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll present the proposed update later, as I'm ninja posting from work at the moment\u00a0 :-)</div>"
