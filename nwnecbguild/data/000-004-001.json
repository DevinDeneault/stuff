Only thing I spot off the bat is their fortsaves and their hitpoints. And that is by Bard-/cursesong alone. Count the bardbuffs from spells and they're not even close.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you get your performance points elsewhere, I'd like Still Spell, Expertise and perhaps Extend Spell. At least those are what I think would be the top three missing feats. I know you have craft wand to compensate, but Still/extended would let you use your 6th lvl slots as it is.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

For a level 20 build you won't be able to set epic traps in any case, though if you're interested in having the skill you'll need 13 modified ranks to max it - assuming you also take a modified 5 ranks in Disable Trap (which is cross-classed for Bard, so takes twice the points) - or 15 without the synergy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe AB and AC stuff you mention will either have to wait for a further post or for someone else posting about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps for now!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
