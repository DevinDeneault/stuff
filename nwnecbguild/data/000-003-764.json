With all stats capped (ie Cons / Dex / Wis / Cha) saves are F43 W50 R38<br/>\n<br/>\nThen add up to 13 casts / day of Divine Favor &amp; extended Divine Favor combined for +5 AB / +5 magic damage and it looks like something simply delightful.<br/>\n<br/>\nLeast important stat being the base AB of 47 (just kidding)<br/>\n<br/>\nOut of curiousity, spell DC for saving throws cast by scrolls states it is 13+spell level in the Wiki. Does anyone know if the same is true with wands? Running around with a wand of the hammer of the gods with a sky high will spell DC sounds pretty appealing<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Paladin(28), Champion of Torm(10), Rogue(2), Human\nSTR: 13\nCON: 8\nINT: 13\n\n01: Paladin(1): Point Blank Shot, Power Attack\n03: Paladin(3): Zen Archery\n05: Paladin(5)\n07: Paladin(7)\n09: Paladin(9): Weapon Focus: Heavy Crossbow\n11: Paladin(11)\n13: Paladin(13)\n15: Paladin(15): Divine Might\n17: Paladin(17)\n19: Paladin(19)\n21: Rogue(1): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=22)\n23: Paladin(21)\n25: Paladin(23): Epic Weapon Focus: Heavy Crossbow\n27: Champion of Torm(2): Great Wisdom III, Great Wisdom IV, (WIS=26)\n29: Champion of Torm(4): Great Wisdom V, (WIS=28)\n31: Champion of Torm(6): Great Wisdom VII, (WIS=30)\n33: Champion of Torm(8): Great Wisdom VIII, Great Wisdom IX, (WIS=33)\n35: Champion of Torm(10): Great Wisdom X, (WIS=34)\n37: Paladin(26): Epic Prowess\n39: Paladin(28): Great Charisma II, (CHA=18)\n\nSkillpoints: 184\nSaving Throw bonuses:\u00a0\nAB (max, naked): 33 (melee), 47 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Paladin(4)\n\n\n01: Discipline(4), Open Lock(1), Save(10),\u00a0\n03: Discipline(1), Save(16),\u00a0\n05: Discipline(1), Save(22),\u00a0\n07: Discipline(1), Save(28),\u00a0\n09: Discipline(1), Save(34),\u00a0\n11: Discipline(1), Save(40),\u00a0\n13: Discipline(1), Save(46),\u00a0\n15: Discipline(1), Save(52),\u00a0\n17: Discipline(1), Save(58),\u00a0\n19: Discipline(1), Save(64),\u00a0\n21: Disable Trap(5), Search(9), Set Trap(14), Spot(5), Tumble(20), UMD(24),\u00a0\n23: Discipline(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n25: Discipline(1), Save(11),\u00a0\n27: Discipline(1), Spot(17),\u00a0\n29: Discipline(1), Spot(3),\u00a0\n31: Discipline(1), Spot(3),\u00a0\n33: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n35: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(8),\u00a0\n37: Discipline(1), Save(14),\u00a0\n39: Discipline(1), Save(20),\u00a0</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi Stag<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for pointing that the odd number thing out. That is very sharp! I don't like it either, As you know the maximum number of Great Wisdom's that can be taken is ten, and I take GW X at level 35 with CoT 10. So if I make some adjustment to the CoT levels towards the end aiming for even wisdom scores where possible this could make it work better.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore I could increase Cha by 2 and drop Wis by 2 to help achieve even CHA numbers whilst leveling, I would lose one Divine Favor Spell cast / day but gain a longer Divine Might duration and damage. Base AB 47 is plenty combined with DF so the build can certainly afford it.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">You know it was only after I wrote this build that Gkorjax reminded me of The Arbalest when I was casually chatting about it. It probably doesn't stand a chance with all the awesome cleric spells your evil cleric/blackguard would have available, and unfortunately smite evil is melee range only. But the saves the build has plus evasion should make my dude somewhat implosion resistant (if such a thing exists)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd thanks for the comment on Min-Maxing I think I should am for a ranged AB of 45 (Mith's AB goal for a good warrior) and try to pump up Cha for more divine damage and duration rather than just rely on the Eagles splendor/Aura of Glory combo. On WoG it will also be able to buff ammunition with UMD which is pretty sweet.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Edit:</strong><br/>\nUpdated version<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Paladin(28), Champion of Torm(10), Rogue(2), Human\nSTR: 14\nCON: 8\nINT: 12\n\n01: Paladin(1): Point Blank Shot, Power Attack\n03: Paladin(3): Zen Archery\n05: Paladin(5)\n07: Paladin(7)\n09: Paladin(9): Weapon Focus: Heavy Crossbow\n11: Paladin(11)\n13: Paladin(13)\n15: Paladin(15): Divine Might\n17: Paladin(17)\n19: Paladin(19)\n21: Rogue(1): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=22)\n23: Paladin(21)\n25: Paladin(23): Epic Weapon Focus: Heavy Crossbow\n27: Champion of Torm(2): Great Charisma I, Great Wisdom III, (WIS=25), (CHA=17)\n29: Champion of Torm(4): Great Wisdom IV, (WIS=27)\n31: Champion of Torm(6): Great Wisdom V, (WIS=28)\n33: Champion of Torm(8): Great Wisdom VI, Great Wisdom VII, (WIS=30)\n35: Champion of Torm(10): Great Wisdom VIII, (WIS=31)\n37: Paladin(26): Epic Prowess\n39: Paladin(28): Great Charisma IV, (CHA=22)\n\nSkillpoints: 184\nSaving Throw bonuses:\u00a0\nAB (max, naked): 34 (melee), 45 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Paladin(4) 6 6 6 5\n\n\n01: Discipline(4), Open Lock(1), Save(10),\u00a0\n03: Discipline(1), Save(16),\u00a0\n05: Discipline(1), Save(22),\u00a0\n07: Discipline(1), Save(28),\u00a0\n09: Discipline(1), Save(34),\u00a0\n11: Discipline(1), Save(40),\u00a0\n13: Discipline(1), Save(46),\u00a0\n15: Discipline(1), Save(52),\u00a0\n17: Discipline(1), Save(58),\u00a0\n19: Discipline(1), Save(64),\u00a0\n21: Disable Trap(5), Search(9), Set Trap(14), Tumble(20), UMD(24),\u00a0\n23: Discipline(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n25: Discipline(1), Save(11),\u00a0\n27: Discipline(1), Spot(17),\u00a0\n29: Discipline(1), Spot(3),\u00a0\n31: Discipline(1), Spot(3),\u00a0\n33: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n35: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(8),\u00a0\n37: Discipline(1), Save(14),\u00a0\n39: Discipline(1), Save(20),\u00a0</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
