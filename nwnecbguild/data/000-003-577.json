      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hi there! I would like you to ask for some help with finishing up a build. It is not anything special I think, as it's Bard/RDD/BG combo. I have not played for years and this build is totally based on what I have managed to read and found on the forums. I have always liked to play Bard/RDD combo in the past and wanted to recreate it for my new playthough of OC, custom modules and basically everything that I could play alone or with friends. As a side thing, if you have a recommendation of big and long modules to play, or hard ones, please let me know!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's more or less worse version of MOGHEDIEN \u2013 Melody of the Dark (BARD 26/ BG 4/ RDD 10) from what I have deducted, Valerfor's build seems to be mostly what I liked in those type of builds, with the exception of higher INT and less STR. Now, I have no practical knowledge if I do not dump my STR too low for higher INT and so on. I was thinking about 2-3 versions of my build.<br/>\nThe one I paste below is the one with highest INT, would like to get your opinions. I had problems with deciding on remaining skill points, if I should put then in concetration, listen, worsen my UMD to 30(33), with INT 16(18) seems like I would cover mostly everything. But now I am probably getting into teritory of 'if this build does everything, then it does nothing right'.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary><table class=\"post_content_table\"><tbody><tr><td>Class Race</td>\n<td>Bard(26), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Blackguard(4), Human</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table><table class=\"post_content_table\"><tbody><tr><td>40</td>\n<td>Human: (Quick to Master)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ba</td>\n<td>01: Bard(1): Power Attack, Cleave</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ba</td>\n<td>02: Bard(2)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ba</td>\n<td>03: Bard(3): Curse Song</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ba</td>\n<td>04: Bard(4): STR+1, (STR=16)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ba</td>\n<td>05: Bard(5)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ba</td>\n<td>06: Bard(6): Still Spell</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ba</td>\n<td>07: Bard(7)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ba</td>\n<td>08: Bard(8): STR+1, (STR=17)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>RDD</td>\n<td>09: Red Dragon Disciple(1): Knockdown</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>RDD</td>\n<td>10: Red Dragon Disciple(2): (STR=19)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>RDD</td>\n<td>11: Red Dragon Disciple(3)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>RDD</td>\n<td>12: Red Dragon Disciple(4): STR+1, Blind Fight, (STR=22)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>BG</td>\n<td>13: Blackguard(1)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>BG</td>\n<td>14: Blackguard(2): {Smite Good}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>BG</td>\n<td>15: Blackguard(3): Divine Might</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>BG</td>\n<td>16: Blackguard(4): STR+1, (STR=23)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>RDD</td>\n<td>17: Red Dragon Disciple(5)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>RDD</td>\n<td>18: Red Dragon Disciple(6): Weapon Focus: Scimitar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>RDD</td>\n<td>19: Red Dragon Disciple(7): (CON=16)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>RDD</td>\n<td>20: Red Dragon Disciple(8): STR+1, (STR=24)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>RDD</td>\n<td>21: Red Dragon Disciple(9): Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar, (INT=18)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>RDD</td>\n<td>22: Red Dragon Disciple(10): {Darkvision}, (STR=28), (CHA=16)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ba</td>\n<td>23: Bard(9)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ba</td>\n<td>24: Bard(10): STR+1, Improved Critical: Scimitar, (STR=29)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ba</td>\n<td>25: Bard(11)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ba</td>\n<td>26: Bard(12)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ba</td>\n<td>27: Bard(13): Epic Prowess</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ba</td>\n<td>28: Bard(14): STR+1, (STR=30)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ba</td>\n<td>29: Bard(15)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ba</td>\n<td>30: Bard(16): Armor Skin</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ba</td>\n<td>31: Bard(17)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ba</td>\n<td>32: Bard(18): STR+1, (STR=31)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ba</td>\n<td>33: Bard(19): Great Strength I, (STR=32)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ba</td>\n<td>34: Bard(20)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ba</td>\n<td>35: Bard(21)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ba</td>\n<td>36: Bard(22): STR+1, Great Strength II, (STR=34)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ba</td>\n<td>37: Bard(23): Lasting Inspiration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ba</td>\n<td>38: Bard(24)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ba</td>\n<td>39: Bard(25): Great Strength III, (STR=35)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Ba</td>\n<td>40: Bard(26): STR+1, Epic Skill Focus: Perform, (STR=36)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Statistic</td>\n<td>Hitpoints: 400</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Skillpoints: 335</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 28/25/21</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>BAB: 26</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>AB (max, naked): 43 (melee), 26 (ranged)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>AC (naked/mundane items only): 23/34</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Spell Casting: Bard(6)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Alignment Changes: 0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Skills</td>\n<td>Concentration 42(45), Discipline 42(55), Hide 5(4), Listen 41(40), Lore 8(38), Open Lock 1(0), Perform 42(55), Spellcraft 41(45), Taunt 42(45), Tumble 40(39), UMD 30(33)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table></details>\n\nBefore bumping my INT by 2, I had a STR 16/DEX 8/CON 14/WIS 8/INT 14/CHA 14 with 2 spare points that would either go into DEX to 10 or CON to 15 (for con buffs that rollls 1+d4, which basically is always +40 when casted). With this kind of ability split I had only 292 skill points which would mean I would have to drop either concetration or listen, or bump my UMD to max and have 25 points which is not enough for any of them I guess. Only heal 25 seemed right though with maxed bard song, take 20 and health kits I should be able to heal any poison or disease even with 0 ranks.<br/>\nIt was like that:\n<table class=\"post_content_table\"><tbody><tr><td>Discipline 43(56), Hide 5(4), Lore 8(37), Open Lock 1(0), Perform 42(55), Spellcraft 42(45), Taunt 43(46), Tumble 40(39), UMD 30(33), remaining skillpoints 37</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\nWith this setup, I had dev crit but only 34 STR as I dropped Great STR for the feats. I also was thinking, that instead of Great STR in this case I could free up 3 feats and go for any of the following: Improved Knockdown, Great Con +1, Expertise (and maybe improved expertise, and use that increased INT). But I could not find any practical information if improved knockdown would be worth the feat, would not knockdown be enough for most mages? I do not think I would be using it vs dragons, for example. Seemed like overkill for my use, but as I said, no practical knowledge. Expertise seems fine, especially with that Taunt combo. I was not sure about Improved one though. Always could go Expertise and 2x Great STR. Just STR 34 seemed too little for dev crit and it seems like it is mostly 'I win, so let's win more', less interaction with my own chatacter, just scoring crits and cry vs undeads :) I am unsure how much STR matters at this level vs other feats.\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary><table class=\"post_content_table\"><tbody><tr><td>Human: (Quick to Master)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>01: Bard(1): Power Attack, Cleave</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>02: Bard(2)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>03: Bard(3): Curse Song</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>04: Bard(4): STR+1, (STR=17)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>05: Bard(5)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>06: Bard(6): Still Spell</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>07: Bard(7)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>08: Bard(8): STR+1, (STR=18)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>09: Red Dragon Disciple(1): Knockdown</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>10: Red Dragon Disciple(2): (STR=20)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>11: Red Dragon Disciple(3)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>12: Red Dragon Disciple(4): STR+1, Blind Fight, (STR=23)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>13: Blackguard(1)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>14: Blackguard(2): {Smite Good}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>15: Blackguard(3): Divine Might</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>16: Blackguard(4): STR+1, (STR=24)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>17: Red Dragon Disciple(5)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>18: Red Dragon Disciple(6): Great Cleave</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>19: Red Dragon Disciple(7): (CON=16)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>20: Red Dragon Disciple(8): STR+1, (STR=25)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>21: Red Dragon Disciple(9): Weapon Focus: Scimitar, (INT=16)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>22: Red Dragon Disciple(10): {Darkvision}, (STR=29), (CHA=16)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>23: Bard(9)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>24: Bard(10): STR+1, Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar, (STR=30)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>25: Bard(11)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>26: Bard(12)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>27: Bard(13): Improved Critical: Scimitar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>28: Bard(14): STR+1, (STR=31)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>29: Bard(15)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>30: Bard(16): Overwhelming Critical: Scimitar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>31: Bard(17)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>32: Bard(18): STR+1, (STR=32)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>33: Bard(19): Devastating Critical: Scimitar</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>34: Bard(20)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>35: Bard(21)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>36: Bard(22): STR+1, Epic Prowess, (STR=33)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>37: Bard(23): Lasting Inspiration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>38: Bard(24)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>39: Bard(25): Armor Skin</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>40: Bard(26): STR+1, Epic Skill Focus: Perform, (STR=34)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table></details>\n\nSo, If it is not any big mess, what do you think? I do not really want epic overpowered character, if going this route I think I would go with one of the existing builds. But I always liked to have more INT on my characters, and more STR to drag that loot with me. Having concetration would help recast buffs while fighting if I am not wrong and listen would be nice to have with Amplify. I guess I could drop ESF Perform as with gloves +30 and probably with +CHA items in game I would not need that +10 perform, but I take it as 'insurance vs negative effects'.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope it is not as big of useless mess as I think it is :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi yecori1001!<br/>\nI think your adjusted build looks very powerful. HP 400 in a build with 26 bard levels (d6 hit die!) is decent, along with AB 43, it is effective 50 AB with bard/curse song 16+ (+2AB/-5AC to enemies) and 56 AB if you taunt them as well. However it is very nice to not have to even rely on these to hit things well.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI dont think you need improved expertise with +4 AC from RDD 10 and +8 AC from Tumble plus tower shield, but expertise might be nice. I dont think you will have trouble hitting things with taunt and curse song, so the expertise for extra AC might be good against mobs in some environments.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nYour curse song should lower the discipline score of enemies, so knockdown attempts should be easier, plus one has all the AB boosts. I think it would be ok to have plain knockdown in a medium sized character, it is just my preferences I guess.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother way to deal with mages is to use the Bard's silence spell. Cast it on yourself, you will be surrounded by a silence aura, if it catches a mage before they can get a dispel off, then the mage might be in trouble (This is Grizzled_Dwarflord's idea in his <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/vicar-of-the-void-cleric-35-monk-4-ranger-1-t2355317.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Vicar of the Void</a> build, with thanks to GDL) the build also has haste and invisibility, so your bard could be charging at the mage invisible and hasted with a silence aura.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some thoughts. At the moment I can't see anything I would change anything significantly, Int 16(18) is a reasonable idea for a bard, they tend to have so many great class skills which eat up the skill points. UMD can be 30 modified or 35 or 40 depending on magical items, bards can use scrolls without a check, with the hardcore UMD setting, provided they exceed the item value.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks Orion for the input. Do not you think I reduce the STR too much? When I compare my 36 STR (or 34 with dev crit for the 14 int version) to 40 it seems like a big different for the cost for 'skill points' only. After reading threads and seeing sometimes even 6 feats into Great STR it does seem like it. However I have not much practical knowledge so I might be misjuding it.<br/>\nI would not see a way to put Expertise in the INT 16 build, dropping one great str is equal to dropping 2 of them, then it would be 34 STR with expertise and maybe improved knockdown or toughness for 40 hp? But is it worth it? In the INT 14 INT, I could see dropping dev crit, great cleave and OC for expertise and and maybe 2 great STR to bring it up to 36 STR. But then I would miss out around 86 skill points.<br/>\nI was testing scrolls in SP module and I guess I was on normal settings as level 9 was failing without 33 UMD. In the best case scenario I would like to have 45 modified umd, just could not see what other still I could adjust without destroying their usefulness when they are not maxed. I am predicting/guessing that with bard, instruments etc I would not need much illegal equipment to use on my char, most of it should be available with 33 +modified CHA at later time. Would not be suprised if I am totally wrong. As you are saying, in the hardcore setting, those 3 points could be easly put in Concentration, Discipline and Taunt to bump it to 43.<br/>\nIn the end I think I must answer to myself if resisting taunt, ability to recast some buffs in fight and ability to 'listen out' some enemies is worth sacrificing the STR, but as you notice, I am having a problem with estimating the value of STR.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">That's right Orion, I would like to have something of a jack of all trades that is fun to play not just pure fighter with INT 8 for some of releplaying purposes. Int 16(18) I think basically covers mostly all skills, with the exception of low-end UMD. I think persuade for modules will be enough from CHA items and songs, or at least enough for most convos.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's a fair point Webshaman, it is just always hard to have everything, it seems like it's always 1 more feat missing, a little more here and there... I guess I could switch one Great STR from the INT 18 build towards Expertise, on 36th or 39th level when my Taunt would be fully skilled, for and end-game build, as in middle-game it will be locked out by RDD and then I think UMD/Perform boost is more important to increase first. Since 35 STR gives nothing, I would have one more feat free unless I decide to drop Improved Critical: Scimitar for another Great STR, but since 34/36 STR seems fine I think IC might be better to keep, unless it's not?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I understand correctly, Improved Expertise is -10 attack rolls and +10 AC of other type. Basic Taunt is -6, which would still result in -4 for attack rolls, am I correct? Seems like normal Expertise would be\u00a0 better and if I am not replacing IC, the free feat could go towards Improved Knockdown for that more sure hit, especially when we are dropping STR even further.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, build would be the same as the first spoiler but STR: 15 (34) DEX: 8 CON: 14 (16) WIS: 8 INT: 16 (18) CHA: 14 (16) with two Great STR at the end replaced with Expertise and Improved Knockdown. Seems alright?<br/>\nAlternative would be STR: 15 (36) DEX: 8 CON: 14 (16) WIS: 8 INT: 16 (18) CHA: 14 (16), with IC replaced with Expertise only, everything shifted earlier and Expertise taken at 36 level for the combo.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I have compared spells I drafted earlier, with your list Orion, most of them were the same choices. Though, I think there are few things I would do differently. Please let me know what you think!<br/>\n<br/>\nlevel 2 - Would not Ghostly Visage be better over Clarity/Invisibility (Improved Invisibility is available at later level, would not be better to get something else rather than duplicating the spell from the list?). Damage reduction even that small be still useful at high level, it lasts for 26 minutes with bard 26 and maybe it can be stacked with Ethereal visage? Somewhat we could get protection of mind spells from Protection from aligment, maybe not against everything though.<br/>\n<br/>\nlevel 3 - Magic Circle seems like a bit of overkill when having protection from aligment, as it grants same immunity for allies over only yourself. Maybe Displacement could server better here? Find traps maybe I would exchange with Greater magic weapon but that depends I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nlevel 4 - I do not think I can agree with Legend Lore when we are a bard, that has 38 lore without bard song (that can give +15) and Identify spell. 38+15 is already 53 lore, with Identify it's 53+10+26=89 if I understand correctly. I though lore was capping earlier for identifying most of the eq. Legend Lore offers longer durability, but I think that inconvenience is worth having another spell slot. In single player it would not matter, in the online, I guess we could get a scroll of that spell because of umd and cast once we have enough equipment. If rest is not restricted, then you can use Identity as well. I think I would get on that level Hold Monster instead.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Invisibility is good to save on level 4 spells. The concealment from II persists but to hide from sight again recasting the invis is nice with a lvl2 spell, unless there are potions etc <br/>\nDisplacement is made redundant by II concealment. <br/>\nMagic circle is another mind immunity spell in case one runs out of prot v alignment<br/>\nHold Monster is a nice spell, although unless CHA 16 is massively boosted the DC will not be high, and there are limited spells per day, I have prioritised non DC casting.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I think your high starting intelligence is indeed that, a luxury. If you want it, you can have it. But there are other things you can do with those buy points that makes the build more powerful. <br/>\nStarting with intelligence 16 instead of 14 only adds one skill to the build. You take no feats that require or benefit from intelligence. Concentration, Spellcraft and Taunt are \"nice to have\" skills, but not necessarily essential to the build. In most cases one, and sometimes even two of them can be tossed out, depending on your play style and the environment. That being said - I love the Bard skill set and think Bard should have more skill points per level.<br/>\nIf I had those 4 buy points to spend at character creation, I would probably rather spend them on raising charisma to 16 to let it end at 18 for a better Divine Might, better saves and an extra lvl 4 spell slot.<br/>\nAnother tweak I think of is starting with strength 16, swapping Improved critical with Great strength and end up with strength 38 and +1 AB and damage.<br/>\nYou can do both if you are willing to start with intelligence 12, ending at 14. But then you have to say goodbye to your intelligent warrior and two full skills.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Good point Orion, thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your voice Mick! Mostly I wanted to make something with higher INT, and yeah, I though about feats that higher INT unlocks, still thinking to be honest. I think I can agree with you that Concentration is a luxury, but since I have 16 int, why not. I could swap it for maxed out umd and rest into Heal. With lower INT I think there is not much to talk about, Valerfor's build seems to be already what it is supposed to be. In the end, I think build is supposed to be fun. Without it, I could take out Still Spell I think and just equip/reequip armor. In this case, Extended spell would be much better I think. Biggest advantage of INT 16 is\u00a0 Listen, that I could, with maybe Amplify, hear some enemies sneaking up to me. Concentration also allows to recast some spells while fighting, without dev crit there might be a cases of overrun fights where maybe it could be useful. But that is just my theory.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe point, why I was making this thread, was to confirm if I was not making my build too much of a weak one by redistributing its strenght. I have found Valerfor's build during checking and I would totally go for it if I wanted lower INT, seems nicely build - well, I would remove 2 STR from it to boost INT a bit for more points, as you might noticed my question on one of your threads about the point distribution. I was thinking about that too. But remaining points were hard to decide how to spend them. Also with that build I definetly would want to go dev crit, with the increased INT, STR was dropping to 34 and 2 ability points remaining. What I am sure of, is that I'd like to play Bard 26, RDD10 with minimum of 14 starting INT. Now just to optimize it...\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary><table class=\"post_content_table\"><tbody><tr><td>STR+1</td>\n<td>DEX+1</td>\n<td>CON+1</td>\n<td>WIS+1</td>\n<td>INT+1</td>\n<td>CHA+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>16</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>14</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table></details>\nBut does the STR matter that <em>much </em>in the end? That is what I am trying to find out. Orion's put some examples, and without RDD it seems like high STR. Yes, I can agree the point of RDD is mostly raising STR over the standard limit, but does it really matter that much? It adds to ther attack, but is not it high enough? I am sure I will be using one-handed weapon and shield, so that 1.5x multiplier will not apply to me. 36 STR vs 40 STR seems like +2 modifier only. With 34 is only +3. I am really trying to see how it matters, why pick 36 STR instead of 34 and maybe get two expertises for example. Maybe on tight rolls, but if without RDD 36 STR is very high, would it be really that tight? I doubt this build would do well in PvP, as I understand game is hardly balanced for it, unless played on specific server. But that is also not the purpose I am trying to find a nice build. Well, maybe I wrote too much about nothing, really, but I hope I show my point :) In the end I would like to learn more about NWN, but with only wiki and not playing the game yet, seems a bit hard to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I am ready to hear more if anything's offered! I am grateful for you all for sharing your knowledge with me!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Did not really want to drop IC for that feat and dropping 2 STR to only get Expertise and maybe Improved Knockdown seemed too much. How unfortunate that Bard can not get great STR as his class epic feat :)<br/>\n<br/>\nTo achieve it, I am dropping Perform +10 feat, which still had 5 perform over with base CHA and gloves +30, now it would need +10 CHA buff to cast it, or +6 when bumping it from 41 to 43 in the skill sheet which still seems easly achieveable (-1 to open lock gives 2 points needed). Difference between gloves/no gloves with this feat was like 2 HP and +1 skill point (+6 instead of +5). In the grand scheme it should not hurt at all. Missed attack rolls is restored from buffed Divine Power, though I think it would still miss one AB only but gets higher saves.\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Class Race\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Bard(26), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Blackguard(4), Human\nAbilies \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0DEX: 8\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0WIS: 8\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CHA: 14 (18)\n40\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Human: (Quick to Master)\nBa\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a002: Bard(2)\nBa\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a004: Bard(4): STR+1, (STR=16)\nBa\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a006: Bard(6): Expertise\nBa\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a008: Bard(8): STR+1, (STR=17)\nRDD\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a010: Red Dragon Disciple(2): (STR=19)\nRDD\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a012: Red Dragon Disciple(4): STR+1, Blind Fight, (STR=22)\nBG\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a014: Blackguard(2): {Smite Good}\nBG\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a016: Blackguard(4): STR+1, (STR=23)\nRDD\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a018: Red Dragon Disciple(6): Weapon Focus: Scimitar\nRDD\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a020: Red Dragon Disciple(8): STR+1, (STR=24)\nRDD\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a022: Red Dragon Disciple(10): {Darkvision}, (STR=28), (CHA=16)\nBa\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a024: Bard(10): STR+1, Still Spell, (STR=29)\nBa\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a026: Bard(12)\nBa\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a028: Bard(14): STR+1, (STR=30)\nBa\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a030: Bard(16): Epic Prowess\nBa\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a032: Bard(18): STR+1, (STR=31)\nBa\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a034: Bard(20)\nBa\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a036: Bard(22): STR+1, Great Charisma I, (STR=32), (CHA=17)\nBa\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a038: Bard(24)\nBa\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a040: Bard(26): STR+1, Lasting Inspiration, (STR=34)\nStatistic\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Hitpoints: 400\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 29/26/22\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0BAB: 26\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0AC (naked/mundane items only): 23/34\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Alignment Changes: 0\nSkills\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Concentration 42(45), Discipline 43(55), Hide 5(4), Listen 41(40), Lore 8(38), Open Lock 1(0), Perform 41(45), Spellcraft 41(45), Taunt 43(47), Tumble 40(39), UMD 29(33)\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nBa\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a002: Discipline(1), Perform(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(5), \nBa\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a004: Discipline(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(5), Taunt(1), \nBa\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a006: Discipline(1), Hide(2), Perform(1), Taunt(1), UMD(3), \nBa\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a008: Discipline(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), UMD(3), \nRDD\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a010: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(3), Spellcraft(1), \nRDD\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a012: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(3), Spellcraft(1), \nBG\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a014: Concentration(4), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), \nBG\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a016: Concentration(3), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(1), \nRDD\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a018: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(3), Spellcraft(1), \nRDD\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a020: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(2), Spellcraft(1), Save(1), \nRDD\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a022: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(6), \nBa\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a024: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(5), UMD(1), \nBa\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a026: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(5), UMD(2), \nBa\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a028: Discipline(1), Perform(6), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), \nBa\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a030: Discipline(1), Perform(6), Taunt(2), \nBa\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a032: Concentration(2), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(5), \nBa\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a034: Concentration(2), Discipline(1), Listen(3), Taunt(3), \nBa\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a036: Concentration(2), Discipline(1), Listen(5), Taunt(1), \nBa\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a038: Discipline(1), Perform(2), Spellcraft(5), Taunt(1), \nBa\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a040: Concentration(2), Discipline(1), Listen(5), Taunt(1), \n</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
