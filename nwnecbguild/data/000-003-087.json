I'm wondering if Empyre may also have entertained this concept at some point as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>edit: Here are two I found in legacy archive just by poking around a few moments. They happen to both be Clc 15 versions.\u00a0 </em><br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>The Miserable Devastating Dwarf</strong> (cleric15/fighter6/weapon master19) by avado<br/>\n<strong>Infernal Thug</strong> (Rogue 13/Fighter 12/Cleric 15) by CrispyCritter</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>I suggest looking for Clc/Ftr/WM or Clc/CoT/WM combos first since WM builds are typically either sculpted for DevCrit or high damage (i.e. STR-focused).\u00a0 Even if a build doesn't specifically design DevCrit into it, most STR builds can be modified to accomplish that task.\u00a0 Just be wary that some of the legacy builds were created before v1.69 so may reflect \"foreign\" concepts using today's perspective (I noticed one of those Ftr 2 club exploit builds in the list I generated).</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Thank you Stagmeister for reminding me!<br/>\n What happened is that my computer was damaged by water. And I have not been able to rescue the hard drive yet, and there are many things that are not important enough to backup, like game-saves. So that derailed this project.<br/>\n SantaClaus was kind and gave me a new computer for Christmas. I have reinstalled the game and a lot of community stuff. In the meantime I had forgotten about this build.<br/>\n I should probably build the character again in a trainer module, just to double-test that it is legal. But I don't like to post builds without previous real gaming experience.

When I returned from family activities over Christmas I found the apartment above mine had decided to dump its leaking bathroom onto my computer (among other things). Thus, I too am in rebuild mode. A tedious task, not helped when CEPs go to war with each other. I currently have the three official campaigns properly loaded, together with Aribeth's Redemption (hence the CEP war) and Sands of Fate, which I hope to actually finish this time. Then it will be Aielund's turn.<br/>\n<br/>\n I also have a couple of unfinished builds from here to firm up, so I wasn't nagging, I promise.<br/>\n<br/>\n And I look forward to seeing the end result of your endeavours in your own good time. <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hey Mick, the build does look very solid. My only consideration about it would be if indispellability is worth all the extra levels (I'm not sold on either alternative, TBH, so I'll just throw it out there for reflection). I know you like to be indispellable, but I find it more important for melee-based arcane builds than for Clerics (hurts a lot more to lose a Premonition or Spell Mantle than anything a Cleric can cast). What buffs are so vital that you wouldn't want to be dispelled? DP and DF are short-duration, and the rest can be substituted by gear as you level up in most servers (including Aielund). At least the way I play Clerics, indispellability is more of a nice to have thing than a must. What if you went with 15+ Cleric levels and then focused more on either Monk, CoT or both? Something like Monk 6 / Cleric 16 /\u00a0CoT 18 would grant you \"free IKD\", more skill points, more skill dumps and higher saves. Basically at the cost\u00a010 CLs. The two feats you lose (Cleric 23 and 26) you get back from CoT 14 and 18, which can also be used to take GW.<br/>\n<br/>\n What do you think? Would you test this alternative?<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
