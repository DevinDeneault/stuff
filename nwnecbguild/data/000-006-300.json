      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hail, ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\n This was one of the most difficult builds to do. Boddyknock was a very ingenious character who spent his time researching things, and yet instead of making him a Wizard, Bioware made him a Sorcerer. For a while, I struggled with the idea of making him a double-arcane caster, with 9th level spells on both Wizard and Sorcerer, and then Pally levels for Divine Shield and Save boosts, but it just didn't feel right. It was only when I abandoned the idea of making him a Sorcerer that I built something for him that was satisfying enough. He's essentially a mage, but one who's intelligent enough to understand he needs to learn some defensive combat techniques to help him stay alive, hence Fighter levels, but also quite an engineer who is very interested in little trinkets and magical devices of all sources, hence Rogue levels for Trap skills and UMD. He focuses on two schools, one to damage his foes and the other one to control their minds. He's not made for PvP, so Enchantment is a very good choice. He can cast a high DC Great Thunderclap, which is an often overlooked but very useful spell. He can also use Tenser's Transformation for +17 AB and two extra attacks per round when he's too lazy to cast spells. The best part is that while items don't merge on Tenser's, Epic Mage Armor does, and so does the cast spell of Haste, so he should have a high AC when shifted. Other than that, he has to stick to wearing an Elven Chain Shirt (no spell failure), and on WoG, which is where he is supposed to be played, Shield bracers (give Shield-type AC). On any other a non-arcane failure shield will do the trick. If not, he can have a shield equipped and cast only stilled versions of the spells, as with his settings, he has enough spellbook management for this. This build is the exact same level distribution as GDL's War Wizard (and a couple of others), but has a very different approach, as it doesn't get Auto-still feats and focuses in two schools of magic.<br/>\n<br/>\n I was very pleased with the result once I abandoned the Sorcerer idea, hope you like him as well: Boddyknock Glinckle, everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\n Wizard(35), Fighter(2), Rogue(3),
