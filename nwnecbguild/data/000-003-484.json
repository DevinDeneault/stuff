      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">OK, looking at the feats now, I see a problem or rather, I would prioritize differently.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first thing that jumps to my eyes here is Weapon Finesse taken before Called Shot. I would definitely prioritize archer stuff as it's essentially an archer. Now if you're planning to melee till you get AA levels, you need to move the Rapier feats up in the mix there, agree? Here is how I would do it:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- Point Blank Shot, Weapon Focus Longbow<br/>\n2- Rapid Shot<br/>\n3- Called Shot<br/>\n4- Weapon Specialization Longbow<br/>\n6- Blind Fight, Weapon Finesse<br/>\n9- Weapon Focus Rapier<br/>\n12- Improved Critical Longbow<br/>\n15- Improved Critical Rapier<br/>\n18- Knockdown<br/>\n19- Improved Knockdown<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest of the feats and the leveling sequence are fine by me. I do consider that having KD / IKD and WF Rapier will give you some versatility even if you're not going to melee all the time. In case you need to, you can do it pretty efficiently I would even go as far as considering dropping Armor Skin down there for even more versatility and EWF Rapier. You may not end up doing this in the end, but I'd leave it somewhere suggested as a viable tweak. Take Fighter 7 at level 7 and Bard 1 at 8 for an updated modified UMD score of 10 instead of 9 (which is essentially the same as 5)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only other thing I would suggest is to move up Bard 2 for level 28 or so for later Tumble and UMD dumps so you're not so gimped for so long with that lack of skill updates. Other than that, I think it's a pretty solid build now.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

However, the comment you made about the AB's for the builds Mick pointed out were low, therefore a dealbreaker, is a little naive.  I think you're getting caught up in a 'who has a higher AB' thinking.  Yes, 60 (or 53 in your latest build) is very nice but,at the end of the day, most PW's aren't built where a naked AB in that range is the norm. Otherwise all you'll see are AA's and WM's running around.  To keep things in perspective, most melee toons (non-WM) are in the low to mid 40's AB-wise.  Is your AB better than those builds?  Mathematically yes.  Does it mean it can fight better?  Not necessarily.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You'd get the monk progression and WIS AC in melee when you need it and with enough AA levels have adequate archer presence and use the DEX allocation solely for reflex and a bit more AC. With the monk progression, the later melee APR AB will rival the later exalted AA APR AB.  There actually isn't all that much more to be gained with bard over wiz since UMD will net few uses.  With wiz there will be no scroll check involved so it's a wash unless there are some killer assassin-only boots or some such uber class-specific loot available.  Just remember to swap out the bow when you want the monk speed boost.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there is high DEX bard or wiz rogue/AA with lots of sneaks for added damage and ED.  Dunno if that is very twisted, though.  Rog AA's were very popular at one time.  Probably still are.<br/>\n<br/>\nLongbow (elf) vs. shortbow (half-elf) isn't even worth discussing IMO.  Seriously.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, for my tastes, Mick's 2-way build is the best I could have done myself and since he's already saved me the anguish and trouble... time to STEAL!     If you don't like the dual DevCrit, stop at Overwhelming and nab that Called Shot feat that was on his wish list and another to be determined.  There are scant few builds that I wouldn't tweak even a bit, and Mick's Blade 'n Bow is one of them.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

For example, Imbue Arrow will use the DEX modifier to adjust AB to see if the arrow hits and it will use the DEX modifier to increase the reflex save DC of the fireball. So, where a 20th level archer with a 32 DEX will have a fireball with a DC of 41 versus the WIS-based (with 13 DEX) archer's fireball with a save of 31, and the AB calculation for the arrow itself will be 10 lower as well.

Therefore, I would make dam sure I got the the foci, specialization &amp; imp crit for that rapier/shield switch.  You have a few choices to accomplish that.  Either dump a few Grt Dex or include more fighter levels.  You are right.  The range attack is nasty.  Too nasty IMO and totally unnecessary for a two-way build like you are attempting.   Get the rapier damage up where it belongs. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd TBH, this is hardly an AA with a twist.  It's a very common build perhaps not by ECB documenting but it's used everywhere right down to the rapier alternative attack (probably the reason it hasn't been posted).  About the only customization that I see are your skill choices which are probably based on the server where you intend to play it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, not trying to rain on your parade, foojin, it'll work just fine, but is nothing special.  BTW, what is the reason for STR 16?  Anticipating +3 mighty bow?  (I realize you need at least STR 13 for PA).  I also question the value of Imp Expertise trying to hit an enemy with an AB of 33.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Regarding Expertise/Improved Expertise, if you want a slightly different approach with defensive feats, consider Dodge and Mobility instead. Those feats provide +5 AC against a single opponent's attacks of opportunity and that enables you to keep your bow out when a low-moderate AB opponent runs up to you and you can continue shooting him in the face instead of having to switch to melee. Keep in mind that PBS is also giving you +1 AB in that situation. (Against, high AB or high damage output opponents, the AoOs may be too painful to take, but handling mobs who rush up this way can be fun. Just don't get swarmed.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, I know others may disagree, but if you actually play this toon through the lower levels, I advise putting Weapon Finesse earlier in DEX builds (e.g. level 1 to level 3). Your toon has 16 STR, so the difference isn't so big, but still +1 or +2 AB for you (and more since you will be looking to boost DEX as much as possible magically with this guy) and it's pre-epic when you will be forced into more melee (because you won't be able to kill the baddies with your bow before they get to you) and having a couple extra AB at that point can be a big help. IMO, toughness or knockdown can be pushed a bit later in the build without much loss (the -4 AB KD penalty makes it least attractive to use at early levels when AB is low anyway).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
