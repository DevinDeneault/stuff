What sets my build apart are the focus on CHA instead of STR and smiter build until Great Smite X instead of critical feats (improve critical, overwhelming critical, and devastating critical). When battle begins, you act as a caster cleric, casting buff to you and your teammates/henchman/summon while softening the opposition with offensive spells or debuff. Later, you charge into the front helping your front-line (hopefully they are still standing and beating the enemy) while your divine buff is still active. I chose the War and Strength domain because of the CHA modification bonus. CoT levels are taken after epic level to ensure that the feats (including bonus feats) are invested to Great Smite X. Paladin levels are for paladin feats and skill dumps at level 40. I have to admit that this build is a late bloomer, which means at pre-epic levels (1 - 20), you are stuck with lvl 4 cleric spells and your playstyle is similar to paladin casting divine might + shield and other buffs then charge to melee your enemy. At mid epic (lvl 21 - 30), you have access to lvl 6 cleric spells and Great Smite V to give variations to your melee style. In order to reach the maximum potential of this build, having access to lvl 9 cleric spells and Great Smite X, you need to reach level 40 by playing the high level module such as Sands of Fate after completing the OC, SoU, and HotU campaigns.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, this is my first build post so if there is an error, please let me know so I won't make the same mistake in another post and share your opinion about this build whether this is a doomed build, mediocre, or good build.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">In vanilla NWN Cleric levels don't affect Smite Evil, only Paladin and CoT levels do. This build has a +143 damage Smite Evil which is very low for a smiter, especially considering that it only has 3 uses per day and the high prerequisite for Greater Smiting. If this is made for an environment where Cleric levels do affect Smite Evil then it might work well, but in vanilla NWN I wouldn't recommend playing this build.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssuming that Cleric levels do affect Smite Evil in your environment, there are a few changes I think you should make.<br/>\nConsider changing the level layout to Cler24/Pal2/CoT14 in order to swap a G WIS feat for Epic Prowess (or any general epic feat by shuffling feats). However this will mean ending at either 18WIS/26CHA or 19WIS/25CHA which wouldn't be ideal. Your current pre-epic spread is Cler18/Pal2, I recommend going with Cler17/Pal2/CoT1 for slightly better saves. Cler18/Pal1/CoT1 prevents you from getting Extra Smiting in pre-epic levels and Cler16/Pal3/CoT1 results in 16 BAB which isn't a good idea for a battle cleric. The best pre-epic spreads for this build are Cler18/Pal2 and Cler17/Pal2/CoT1.<br/>\nThe lack of Blind Fight will be a real problem in many environments, I suggest dropping either Empower Spell or Maximize Spell for Blind Fight. I would also drop the other metamagic feat for either Knockdown, Improved Critical, or Silent Spell. Unfortunately most smiters are feat starved so there's no room to get everything without dropping Great Smiting feats.<br/>\nThe skill choices are decent, it's just a shame that the build is so skill starved.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

To me this is a very clever idea in PvM.<br/>\nIt boosts the AB significantly in a CHA focused build that would otherwise have awful AB outside of smites which are 3x/day.<br/>\nThe cleric 27 in the build allows for the +20 AB cap to be hit easily, and its 'undispellable', which I like in a cleric build.\u00a0<br/>\nEmpowered endurance can help one boost HP.<br/>\nAdd in War Domain and capped strength, one can hit +56 AB at level 40.<br/>\nThere is a 8-14 round duration divine shield and divine might ability to boost AC by 8-14 and divine damage by 8-14 / hit.\u00a0<br/>\nPlus double buffable saves which can be off the charts.<br/>\nThis is not a \"best AB\" or \"best smite damage\" build but more of a serious attempt at a well built charisma based cleric with smiting abilities.<br/>\nI have not seen a thoughtfully designed charisma based cleric for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the weaknesses which was already mentioned by the OP was the cleric spells come late.<br/>\nThe starting stats I would change.\u00a0<br/>\nCHA is increased by 8 and WIS by 5. Two cleric bonus feats are used for great wisdom.\u00a0<br/>\nTherefore 10 usual stat increases plus one great stat feat plus two bonus great wisdoms from cleric.<br/>\nIf the build goes 14 - 8 - 8 - 16 - 12 - 16. During leveling, CHA increased by 10, WIS by 3 (two bonus epic feats from cleric).<br/>\nThe build should have the same ending CHA and WIS, plus Int 12 for 43 more skill points which would allow a skill such as tumble or taunt to be included in the build<br/>\nPlus lvl 6 cleric spells as soon as available for heal / harm / greater sanctuary as soon as it is available.\u00a0<br/>\nI would get lvl 7 cleric spells pre-epic asap for Word of Faith (no save huge AoE blindness) / Summon VII, then use the cleric 23 and 26 levels to access 8 and 9 spells respectively with the bonus feats.<br/>\nI wonder if it is possible for Cleric 26 to come sooner in the build for sooner cleric 9 spells? It would help with playability 1-40.<br/>\nAgree swap Maximize with Blind Fight, an alternative might be silent spell for silent harm/heal/WoF.\u00a0<br/>\nAgree the Cleric 17 / P2 / CoT 1 split pre-epic adds more saves, not that the build needs it but its essentially free saves.<br/>\nWith the double-buffable base saves at 30 I don't think spellcraft needs be that high,\u00a0the +8 to saves against spells could be toned down a little to assist investment in other skills such as tumble.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it will do fine in the NWN OC, SoU, HoTU campaigns. It will probably do ok in Aielund.\u00a0<br/>\nIn a low to mid magic PvM (enchantment +1-6) it would probably do fine.\u00a0<br/>\nIn WoG I would put Taunt in the build as well just in case all those cleric buffs are not enough for an extra -6 AC to opponents.<br/>\nIt is in the PvP and high magic environments (ie +15-20 AB weapons) where I believe this build could struggle.<br/>\nBut overall there are probably enough places where this build can have a home.<br/>\nThanks for sharing this build concept, I enjoyed reading it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks as well for the tips on pasting without formatting Wildleaf, I have learnt something!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thank you very much for the warm welcome and great inputs. I checked the nwnwiki and I missed one detail about smite evil where the bonus damage are determined by levels of paladin and/or CoT.\u00a0 *sigh* There goes my idea of 'smiter cleric'. That means I need to re-purpose my build idea without Great Smite feats which freed many feats for Auto-Silent/Auto-Quickened spell feats, epic spell focus feats (necromancy or evocation), blind fight, and knockdown. To Yunim and Orion, I could rebuild the first build so that at pre-epic lvls, lvl 5 spells are available and lvl 8 at mid-epic, but at the cost of epic weapon focus feats, which lower the AB to an already low AB build. If I remade my starting stats to 14/8/8/16/12/16, Great Smite X wouldn't be possible even if the toon has the required stats. I will edit the first post so the maximize spell is switched with blind fight and kept the rest as it is (minus the box) if it could be useful to other players.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond build's description (post-edit) : I remade my starting stats with 14 INT to have more skill points to invest. Taunt and Spot skills are now included (other alternative is Tumble by replacing Spot or Taunt).\u00a0 At pre-epic levels, the build functions as a caster cleric with lvl 9 spells plus\u00a0 metamagic feats (extended + empower + maximize spells). I also moved divine might + shield and blind fight feats to pre-epic for some melee capability. At mid-epic, silent (or quickened as an alternative) spell feats up to auto level are invested to improve your spellcasting ability along with cleric lvl 24 for undispelable buff. More CoT levels are also taken for higher saving throw. In late epic, epic weapon focus feat is taken along with spell focus necromancy (or evocation if preferred) up to epic level to further improve your spellcasting experience. Other feats like armor skin and knockdown are taken for defensive and offensive purposes. Thanks to Orion for this input so the non-smiter Divine Trinity build could be improved. The concept is still the same: you act as caster cleric, casting buff to you and your teammates while softening the opposition with offensive spells or debuff. Later, you cast divine might+shield+other buffs and act as a melee, helping the front-line (if your teammates are still alive and kicking around) before the buff duration runs out.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nTitle: Divine Trinity (Cleric 27/ Paladin 3/ Champion of Torm 10)<br/>\nRace : Human<br/>\nAlignment : Lawful Good<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 14<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 8<br/>\nWIS: 16 (19)<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 15 (26)<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Cleric(1): Power Attack, Extend Spell, Domain Strength, Domain War<br/>\n02: Paladin(1)<br/>\n03: Cleric(2): Weapon Focus: Longsword<br/>\n04: Cleric(3): WIS+1, (WIS=17)<br/>\n05: Cleric(4)<br/>\n06: Cleric(5): Empower Spell<br/>\n07: Cleric(6)<br/>\n08: Cleric(7): WIS+1, (WIS=18)<br/>\n09: Cleric(8): Maximize Spell<br/>\n10: Cleric(9)<br/>\n11: Cleric(10)<br/>\n12: Cleric(11): WIS+1, Blind Fight, (WIS=19)<br/>\n13: Cleric(12)<br/>\n14: Cleric(13)<br/>\n15: Cleric(14): Divine Might<br/>\n16: Cleric(15): CHA+1, (CHA=16)<br/>\n17: Cleric(16)<br/>\n18: Cleric(17): Divine Shield<br/>\n19: Cleric(18)<br/>\n20: Champion of Torm(1): CHA+1, (CHA=17)<br/>\n21: Cleric(19): Silent Spell<br/>\n22: Cleric(20)<br/>\n23: Cleric(21)<br/>\n24: Cleric(22): CHA+1, Great Charisma I, (CHA=19)<br/>\n25: Cleric(23): Automatic Silent Spell I<br/>\n26: Cleric(24)<br/>\n27: Champion of Torm(2): Great Charisma II, Automatic Silent Spell II, (CHA=20)<br/>\n28: Champion of Torm(3): CHA+1, {Smite Evil}, (CHA=21)<br/>\n29: Champion of Torm(4): Automatic Silent Spell III<br/>\n30: Champion of Torm(5): Great Charisma III, (CHA=22)<br/>\n31: Champion of Torm(6): Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword<br/>\n32: Cleric(25): CHA+1, (CHA=23)<br/>\n33: Cleric(26): Spell Focus: Necromancy, Greater Spell Focus: Necromancy<br/>\n34: Paladin(2)<br/>\n35: Cleric(27)<br/>\n36: Champion of Torm(7): CHA+1, Epic Spell Focus: Necromancy, (CHA=24)<br/>\n37: Champion of Torm(8): Armor Skin<br/>\n38: Champion of Torm(9)<br/>\n39: Paladin(3): Great Charisma IV, (CHA=25)<br/>\n40: Champion of Torm(10): CHA+1, Knockdown, (CHA=26)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 306<br/>\nSkillpoints: 215<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 37/38/30<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8<br/>\nBAB: 25<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 30 (melee), 24 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane items only): 11/22<br/>\nSpell Casting: Cleric(9)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nConcentration 42(41), Discipline 43(45), Persuade 7(15), Spellcraft 38(40), Spot 43(47), Taunt 42(50)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Concentration(4), Persuade(4), Spellcraft(4), Save(8), <br/>\n02: Concentration(1), Discipline(5), Persuade(1), Taunt(5), Save(1), <br/>\n03: Concentration(1), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(2), Save(2), <br/>\n04: Concentration(1), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(4), <br/>\n05: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(7), <br/>\n06: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(10), <br/>\n07: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(13), <br/>\n08: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(16), <br/>\n09: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(19), <br/>\n10: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(22), <br/>\n11: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(25), <br/>\n12: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(28), <br/>\n13: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(31), <br/>\n14: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(34), <br/>\n15: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(37), <br/>\n16: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(40), <br/>\n17: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(43), <br/>\n18: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(46), <br/>\n19: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(49), <br/>\n20: Discipline(18), Spot(23), Save(13), <br/>\n21: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(2), Save(14), <br/>\n22: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(17), <br/>\n23: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(20), <br/>\n24: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(23), <br/>\n25: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(26), <br/>\n26: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(29), <br/>\n27: Discipline(7), Spot(7), Save(20), <br/>\n28: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(23), <br/>\n29: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(26), <br/>\n30: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(29), <br/>\n31: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(32), <br/>\n32: Concentration(6), Spellcraft(6), Save(25), <br/>\n33: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(28), <br/>\n34: Concentration(1), Taunt(32), <br/>\n35: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(2), Save(2), <br/>\n36: Discipline(3), Spot(4), <br/>\n37: Discipline(2), Spot(1), Save(2), <br/>\n38: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(5), <br/>\n39: Concentration(4), Discipline(1), Taunt(5), <br/>\n40: Discipline(2), Spot(3),<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Hellball 120 damage 1x/day. They will only cost one feat but require significant caster level investment.<br/>\nSure Paladin 26 CoT 14 can have 440 damage smites but then you end up with 26 levels of paladin when you aren't smiting. In a rest restricted environment that is crummy. I would always want cleric over paladin from a power perspective, the number of spells paladins get per day is tiny compared with a cleric.<br/>\nThanks for letting me know the reason for the starting attributes, that is a good reason to keep your original starting attribute split for the old build.\u00a0<br/>\nWith the new one if you do choose to go with that one I would try to get Blind Fight, DS and DM earlier than late epics and consider getting with undispellability from cleric 24 sooner as well (Its pretty annoying to cast all your buffs then get them dispelled)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Orion, I am grateful that you appreciate my first build despite its shortcomings. I seem to stumble on an exotic or unusual build/playstyle of smiter cleric with lvl 9 cleric\u00a0 spells. I am considering a second approach with more CoT levels, courtesy to Yunim's input so the level spread will become Cleric 24/ CoT 14/ Paladin 2. I dubbed such approach as \"Divine Trinity of Smite mk.2\".\u00a0 I don't know if the cleric levels is enough for undispelable or not. Skill starvation due to 10 INT heavily limits the skill investment. Spellcraft could be dropped for Taunt or Tumble if preferred. Heavy cleric levels increases the buff from War and Strength domain, but resulting in drop of Smite Evil damage. Perhaps if there is a module/server where cleric levels is counted to Smite Evil damage, the Smiter Cleric build can gain a foothold.\u00a0 If I am in a mood to play an unusual build, I will revisit this build or there is another character builder who can build a better smiter cleric.\u00a0Without further ado, I give another shot at Smiter Cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nTitle: Divine Trinity\u00a0of Smite mk.2 (Cleric 24/ Paladin 2/ Champion of Torm 14)<br/>\nRace : Human<br/>\nAlignment : Lawful Good<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 14<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 8<br/>\nWIS: 14 (19)<br/>\nINT: 10<br/>\nCHA: 18 (26)<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Cleric(1): Power Attack, Divine Shield, Domain Strength, Domain War<br/>\n02: Paladin(1)<br/>\n03: Cleric(2): Weapon Focus: Longsword<br/>\n04: Paladin(2): CHA+1, {Smite Evil}, (CHA=19)<br/>\n05: Cleric(3)<br/>\n06: Cleric(4): Divine Might<br/>\n07: Cleric(5)<br/>\n08: Cleric(6): CHA+1, (CHA=20)<br/>\n09: Cleric(7): Extra Smiting<br/>\n10: Cleric(8)<br/>\n11: Cleric(9)<br/>\n12: Cleric(10): CHA+1, Extend Spell, (CHA=21)<br/>\n13: Cleric(11)<br/>\n14: Cleric(12)<br/>\n15: Cleric(13): Blind Fight<br/>\n16: Cleric(14): CHA+1, (CHA=22)<br/>\n17: Cleric(15)<br/>\n18: Cleric(16): Improved Critical: Longsword<br/>\n19: Cleric(17)<br/>\n20: Cleric(18): CHA+1, (CHA=23)<br/>\n21: Cleric(19): Great Charisma I, (CHA=24)<br/>\n22: Cleric(20)<br/>\n23: Cleric(21)<br/>\n24: Champion of Torm(1): CHA+1, Great Smite I, (CHA=25)<br/>\n25: Cleric(22)<br/>\n26: Cleric(23): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=15)<br/>\n27: Champion of Torm(2): Great Smite II, Great Smite III<br/>\n28: Champion of Torm(3): WIS+1, (WIS=16)<br/>\n29: Champion of Torm(4): Great Smite IV<br/>\n30: Champion of Torm(5): Great Smite V<br/>\n31: Champion of Torm(6): Great Smite VI<br/>\n32: Champion of Torm(7): WIS+1, (WIS=17)<br/>\n33: Champion of Torm(8): Great Smite VII, Great Smite VIII<br/>\n34: Champion of Torm(9)<br/>\n35: Champion of Torm(10): Great Smite IX<br/>\n36: Champion of Torm(11): WIS+1, Great Smite X, (WIS=18)<br/>\n37: Champion of Torm(12)<br/>\n38: Champion of Torm(13)<br/>\n39: Champion of Torm(14): Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword, Great Wisdom II, (WIS=19)<br/>\n40: Cleric(24): CHA+1, (CHA=26)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 312<br/>\nSkillpoints: 129<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 38/40/30<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8<br/>\nBAB: 25<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 30 (melee), 24 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane items only): 9/20<br/>\nSpell Casting: Cleric(9)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nConcentration 43(42), Discipline 42(44), Persuade 4(12), Spellcraft 40(40)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Concentration(4), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(4), Save(3),\u00a0<br/>\n02: Concentration(1), Discipline(5),\u00a0<br/>\n03: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(2),\u00a0<br/>\n04: Concentration(1), Discipline(2),\u00a0<br/>\n05: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(2),\u00a0<br/>\n06: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(1),\u00a0<br/>\n07: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(2),\u00a0<br/>\n08: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(3),\u00a0<br/>\n09: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(4),\u00a0<br/>\n10: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(5),\u00a0<br/>\n11: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(6),\u00a0<br/>\n12: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(7),\u00a0<br/>\n13: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(8),\u00a0<br/>\n14: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(9),\u00a0<br/>\n15: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(10),\u00a0<br/>\n16: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(11),\u00a0<br/>\n17: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(12),\u00a0<br/>\n18: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(13),\u00a0<br/>\n19: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(14),\u00a0<br/>\n20: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(15),\u00a0<br/>\n21: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(16),\u00a0<br/>\n22: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(17),\u00a0<br/>\n23: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(18),\u00a0<br/>\n24: Discipline(20), Save(1),\u00a0<br/>\n25: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(2),\u00a0<br/>\n26: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(1),\u00a0<br/>\n27: Discipline(3), Save(1),\u00a0<br/>\n28: Discipline(1), Save(3),\u00a0<br/>\n29: Save(6),\u00a0<br/>\n30: Discipline(2), Save(7),\u00a0<br/>\n31: Discipline(1), Save(9),\u00a0<br/>\n32: Save(12),\u00a0<br/>\n33: Discipline(2), Save(13),\u00a0<br/>\n34: Discipline(1), Save(15),\u00a0<br/>\n35: Discipline(1), Save(17),\u00a0<br/>\n36: Discipline(1), Save(19),\u00a0<br/>\n37: Discipline(1), Save(21),\u00a0<br/>\n38: Discipline(1), Save(23),\u00a0<br/>\n39: Discipline(1), Save(25),\u00a0<br/>\n40: Concentration(14), Persuade(3), Spellcraft(11),\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
