(currently playing this on WoG - Merigo, if you see her on the server).<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth Mithdradates and Grizzled_Dwarflord made some builds in 2005 in the archives, Mithdradates a human dex based dual shortsword wielder with epic dodge and 42 AB, and GDL a strength based dual mace wielder with 40 AB, 30 assassin levels and 16d6 death attack with a DC of 42 (the death attack might have been nerfed since 2005?).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway this time I wanted to try to return the Assassin class to its place of former glory by trying to make a viable elven two-bladed sword wielder with 19d6 death attack, 40 AB and a death attack DC of 38.<br/>\n<br/>\n\u00a0It also has some 320+ skill points to do a whole pile of roguish stuff whilst having elven keen senses, 350 odd base hp to survive melee long enough to dish out some punishment, and with 6 attacks / round (7 with haste) and a large weapon I put in improved disarm for some extra situational AB.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the undispellable improved invisibility feat (50% concealment) from assassin along with darkness abilities this looks like quite a dangerous opponent and a welcome party member<br/>\n<br/>\nExp penalties only on level 20, the rest of the leveling is exp penalty free...<br/>\n<br/>\nOne could always drop toughness for improved knockdown but I didn't want to be too risque with the HP in a dedicated melee character<br/>\n<br/>\nOh and for some inspiration:<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Header-darth-maul-bastila-shan-jedi-guard-star-wars-double-lightsaber-blade-1.jpg\" /><br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Rogue(7), Fighter(8), Assassin(25), Elf\nSTR: 15 (30)\nCON: 12\nINT: 16\n\n01: Rogue(1): Two-Weapon Fighting\n03: Rogue(2): Ambidexterity, {Evasion}\n05: Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}\n07: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Two-Bladed Sword\n09: Assassin(2): Improved Knockdown\n11: Assassin(4)\n13: Assassin(6)\n15: Rogue(4): Blind Fight\n17: Assassin(8)\n19: Rogue(6)\n21: Fighter(6): Epic Weapon Focus: Two-Bladed Sword, Epic Weapon Specialization: Two-Bladed Sword\n23: Assassin(10)\n25: Assassin(12)\n27: Assassin(14): Great Strength I, Epic Skill Focus: Hide, (STR=22)\n29: Assassin(16)\n31: Assassin(17)\n33: Assassin(19): Great Strength III, (STR=26)\n35: Assassin(21)\n37: Assassin(23)\n39: Assassin(25): Great Strength V, (STR=29)\n\nSkillpoints: 325\nSaving Throw bonuses: Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +3, Poison: +12\nAB (max, naked): 40 (melee), 30 (ranged)\nSpell Casting:\u00a0\n\n\n01: Disable Trap(4), Hide(4), Listen(4), Move Silently(4), Open Lock(1), Search(4), Set Trap(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(11),\u00a0\n03: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Listen(2), Move Silently(2), Search(2), Set Trap(2), Tumble(2), UMD(2), Save(6),\u00a0\n05: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Listen(2), Move Silently(2), Search(2), Set Trap(2), Tumble(2), UMD(2), Save(4),\u00a0\n07: Discipline(1), Save(11),\u00a0\n09: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n11: Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n13: Disable Trap(2), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n15: Disable Trap(4), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n17: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(7),\u00a0\n19: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Listen(2), Move Silently(2), Tumble(2), UMD(2),\u00a0\n21: Discipline(3), Save(7),\u00a0\n23: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(3),\u00a0\n25: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n27: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(7),\u00a0\n29: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(9),\u00a0\n31: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Listen(2), Move Silently(2), Tumble(2), UMD(2),\u00a0\n33: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(2), Tumble(1),\u00a0\n35: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(2), Tumble(1),\u00a0\n37: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(2), Tumble(1),\u00a0\n39: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n</details>\n<strong>Edit:</strong>\u00a0incorporated Mick Dagger's suggestions into the build<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">The twin blade has a certain coolness factor to it and I remember that you have explored before how you can use it as a large weapon to improve the disarm tactics. Sneak attackers benefit more than other characters from many attacks per round, because it let you attack flat footed creatures with all the attacks in the first attack flurry, and all will give the SA damage. So dual wielding pays well off. With 7 attacks (hasted) per round you land 3 attacks in the first flurry.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaking Fighter makes sense when you build a strength based assassin. You get the Armor proficiencies for free and have enough bonus feats for two weapon fighting plus all essentials. A full BAB class also helps with one more attack per round. Rogue avoids cross classing the stealth skills you need for assassin. SA from rogue also makes ISA stack with Death\u00a0 attack damage. The build concept is good!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have some suggestions for what I believe will improve the build. First of all; with all that Sneak/Death attack damage, it pays off to focus on the things that can help you land sneak attacks. That is stealth, knockdown and flanking. <br/>\nSo I would give the stealth skills priority. I would still use full plate (and perhaps downgrade to chain shirt later on) and find a way to get the epic stealth focus feats. IKD also must in. Flanking is a matter of tactical positioning when playing in a party. Stealth can also help here.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what I would do differently:<br/>\nStart with Str 15, Dex 16 and Con 12 and take strength +1 at level 4 instead of constitution. You cannot take ISA with the bonus feat at assassin 14. Drop the Great dexterity feat and take ESF Hide (or Move silently) instead. Drop one ISA for the other ESF stealth feat.<br/>\nMax out the stealth skills.<br/>\nDon't be shy, drop Toughness! Take IKD instead.<br/>\nAlternatively you can take Epic prowess instead of Toughness. Then you can drop Fighter 7 and 8 and take two levels of Assassin instead. That will give you +2 DC, an extra 1d6 DA damage and a bonus feat. Take an ESF stealth feat or ISA with that feat. You will not get IKD that way though and you will not be able to max out Discipline, but there are ways to live without Discipline.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Then something else rose in the primordial swamp of my subconscious...<br/>\n<br/>\nThis link is a dwarf, and uses Greataxe rather than a twin blade, and is a level 20 build from Valerfor. It's a Fighter 6/ Assassin 10/ Rogue 4 build, and might be of interest. <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/royal-assassin-ftr-6-ass-10-rog-4-t2354443.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Royal Assassin</a><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
