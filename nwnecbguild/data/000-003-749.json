      "content": "<div>Hi GDL<br/>\nThis looks like a pretty solid build idea, cleric / rogue has a lot of great synergies and shadowdancer works very well as well<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Int could be increased to 14 and Wisdom to 15(19) for extra skill points, one is going to use a few to max out the stealth skills + have space for concentration, spellcraft and the rogue goodies<br/>\n<br/>\nI would swap the order of weapon finesse and extend spell if you can<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to have undispellability if I'm running a cleric in WoG but I understand Maximillan Kane has written he didn't necessarily mind it, I think he wrote at length about it in his\u00a0Magical Master build, and I think if you run a few buffs (ie DP + II) at a time it should be fine. its not like undispellability is perfect either, without very high caster levels you are still vulnerable to both Mords and Breaches<br/>\n<br/>\nI am curious as to whether HiPS can dodge greater dispelling or Mords</div>"

      "content": "<div>HiPS can be used to dodge any single target spell like Mords against PvP opponents but it's not completely reliable in PvM, due to the game treating detect differently for PCs and NPCs. Naturally it won't work against AoE dispels or anything with True Seeing, and against high detect opponents it's not completely reliable either.<br/>\nAgainst a PC without TS, if you time it correctly HiPS will almost always cause an action cancel and prevent your opponent from casting. Against an NPC without TS, sometimes they can continue to cast even though they should not be able to detect your character. Their ignorance is strength, since effectively they haven't realised yet that they can't see you.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Thanks for your insights everyone!\u00a0 I think Orion is leaning closer to my line of thought.\u00a0 I wasn't going for undispellable buffs in this build.\u00a0 Indeed, I even opted to stop around Cleric 16/17.\u00a0 Prior to posting the build, I was experimenting with 14 Int, and 15 Wis for starting stats.\u00a0 I found the 12 Int was just not quite enough.\u00a0 There are so many skills to try to make worth while....<br/>\n<br/>\nI also considered dropping SD altogether since the character has Craft Wand and the Trickery Domain (a poor man's HiPS by crafting Invis Wands).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe pre-epic feat selection is less than optimal.\u00a0 I just threw them up there as place holders.\u00a0 While I didn't want to take Toughness, without he has under 300 hit points.\u00a0 Granted he eventually gets HiPs and Epic Dodge, it's that pre-epic portion that might get dicey, exspecially against dedicated casters.\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nMore to think and ponder.\u00a0 I think there may be a niche for a build like this, particularly as a party character that can platoon as both healer and trapper.</div>"
