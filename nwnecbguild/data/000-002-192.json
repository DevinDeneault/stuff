      "content": "<div>Mick is the creator of the build and the best to answer questions about it, but as for your other question, I will try to explain briefly what is the main difference (without being the only) of a PvP server Vs a PvM one.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn PvP servers you do not have the middle ground, there are no builds that are geared towards making your levelling process easier or builds that are flavourful. You always build with the exact environment in mind (items, rules changes, etc) and most importantly you build based on what you are going to face from the rest of the players. You will see many small changes &amp; details that in PvM we ignore or we leave up to the player to decide, like being an Elf because they are spotting better than anyone else. You won't see an average (or simply good) weapon master, you will see a Half-Orc maxed-out strength with a scythe or the opposite, a Dwarven Defender! Clerics are everywhere of course, at level 20 and because these servers usually nerf to the ground Isaacs Missiles, you will probably encounter Ice Storm spammers and so on...</div>"

It is based on a half elf character I played many years ago on a level 20 PW.\u00a0 I enjoyed playing that character and I was satisfied with how it performed in PvM. I improved the build further before posting it here. So that's the story behind why it is flagged as PvM.<br/>\nWhen you build for PvP, you build to beat specific opponents in a given environment. That is not the story behind this build.</div>",
