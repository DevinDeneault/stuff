      "content": "<div>I see that you have great confidence in your playing skills alessiaccio for going into combat with 85 hp at lvl 20! That, or you do not plan to get hit, which is a wise choice always ;) And although I understand your need to have as many skill points as possible, you can optimize your attributes quite a bit. Your dexterity is what keeps you alive (AC) and what makes you hit as well (AB), so you better have it as high as possible, considering that you also have a lot of 3/4 BAB levels in there as well as keeping in mind that you will always want to use Rapid Shot for that extra arrow (another -2 to AB).\u00a0 Why do you need 16 Charisma in your build with only 8 Bard levels? To take a bonus 3rd level slot? Use your UMD man, scrolls, wands, you name it. And you absolutely do not need 16 Intelligence either, you have plenty of skill points already. Use scrolls/wands of darkness to land your SA damage and keep a stack of invisibility potions to disappear when trouble is coming your way. <br/>\n<br/>\nStart with: Str 11 Dex 17(22) Con 10 Int 14 Wis 8 Cha 14 as a minimum and you just gained +1AB/AC, +20 Hp, +1Dmg, +1 Ref/Fort. <br/>\nSkills (179): Spellcraft 23(25), Tumble 20(26), Listen 18(17), Search 23(25), Open Locks 9(15), Set Traps 9 (15), Perform 13(15), UMD 18(20), Disable Traps 16(20), Move Silently 15(21), Hide 15(21) <br/>\nOr something like that and keep in mind that all your dexterity-based skills will also get enhanced further by the increase of your dexterity in-game (+6) and the various tools that are available (lockpicks, potions of cunning &amp; grace, etc). <br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck,</div>"
