      "content": "<div><strong>Man-at-Arms (Medieval Soldier), Fighter(38), Bard(2)<br/>\nBy Tyr Templar</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Concept:</strong> The Man-at-Arms is a highly trained, heavily armed medieval soldier, who resolves \"diputes\" not with diplomacy but on the battle field with Blade (medium or large), Heavy Flail or Polearm, whatever the \"issue\" may call for, having specialized training and thus mastery in them all.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>The Build--Pros and Cons:</strong> The Man-at-Arms enjoys a very good (high) AB 47 (46+1 Song), good AC (for a melee build), good HPs, a nice skill set (thanks to bard), decent saves (excluding will, and which you\u2019ll want to shore up as is typical of most melee builds), and rather wonderful damage output thanks not only to STR but also FTR specialization on not just one but FOUR different weapons\u2014namely: Scimitar (med-size, Slashing, enabling use of Tower Shield for AC, too), Heavy Flail (large, Bludgeoning), Halberd (large, Piercing and Slashing), and Great Sword (large, Slashing), thus dishing out all three physical damage types (and does so by the bucket loads, too!).

With mastery in four (4) different weapons, the Man-at-Arms is and remains unique , it being my pleasure to revisit this idea in light of the patch and (finally) get around to posting same.

      "content": "<div>Empyre,<br/>\nI appreciate your enthusiasm for the Man-at-Arms, ... thanks [remainder of comment edited as what it referred to has been cured, thus making the rest of this comment unnecessary and moot]. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, gotta admit it is rather nice to have options--especially when able to cover off all 3 different physical damage types as here, with different weapons sizes, too. Just like mages have choice when it comes to their spells, it is quite nice for melee to have options in terms of different weapons, too. The scimmy with its crit range is really wonderful for making quick work of your foes and/or chewing through the mobs, but not so good when up against the big boss (like an evil lich, dragon or other such crit. immunes, like a pale master (player)), etc.. For that, you whip out your big weapon, pick the right one for the job (and gives a nice bonus in the disarm game, too). Also, with 4 weapon specializations, no problem when it comes to covering off all of the elemental damage types either. Some worlds limit one element damage enhancement per weapon, but when you've four of them to enhance ... Yep, what the Man-at-Arms is all about: focused specialization in 4 weapons as opposed to only a single one, because having choice/freedom is I agree good!   <br/>\n<br/>\nCrit and Bludgeon ON!

Spells) were more important. If on the other hand one isn't much of a taunter (nice to have, works especially good vs. melee among others, and which will nicely be enhanced even further if add charisma gear as per the discussion, below), then spot is a good alternative, indeed (heh, not just hear the STR-based sneaky types coming, but go forth and hunt them down, eh?!! I LIKE IT!). <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, spot speaks to the hide skill whereas listen speaks to move silently when it comes to the sneaky types; listen on its own works quite nicely (as against move silently skill, not hide though so can't go hunt them with that alone, true), I do rather like taunt, thus training it up instead of the usual UMD since Bard entitles access to arcane items, bard toys, etc. UMD's only really necessary for monk gear, possibly some obscure cleric items; however, if want to make use of such gear, etc., depending of course on the availability of such gear, which is world-dependent, then that's another possibility as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers should of course feel free to adjust to suit their own needs/preferences, as always. <br/>\n<br/>\n----</div></blockquote>\n<strong>Discussion:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nYes, Max, this is most true re: WS. Once WS is taken pre-ep by fighter, opens up EWS in epics which can be taken as a bonus feat by CoT just as it can as a Fighter, and great thing to point out! Also, 10 CoT increases all saves +5, and if take 8 of it pre-epic, also boosts reflex as Mick likewise points out. Taking all 10 of it pre-ep means getting the +5 sacred defense in nice and early, along with the reflex boost. Cost: nothing, this is most true (other than CoT alignment restriction--i.e., non-evil). Really does speak to our Yardstick project, doesn't it? (Thanks, guys!!). <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Man-at-Arms: Fighter/Bard. Simple yet Effective, 2-Class Design (PvM/E):</strong><br/>\nThat said, the build as posted 2-class design is very playable, designed for PvM/E . Combining bard for the skills, arcane access and even a nice song (more of a whistle, really, still nice, even gives a tad bit of a boost to will save albeit as a warrior as originally posted you'll definitely want to put your bard entitlement to scrolls (and/or clarity potions) to good use, as is just so typical of melee builds. Bard entitles arcane items, bard instruments and other such toys, which is really nice to have on a melee build, combined with 4 weapon specializations, and the Man-at-Arms is as versatile as s/he is effective, and no restriction when it comes to alignment either (apart from Bard non-lawful, can enjoy the full good-evil axis, being good, neutral or evil as one may desire--i.e., no restrictions as such in turn). Something to be said for a two-class build: simple and efficient yet effective, and very fun to play (PvM/E), and thus worthy of a post. (Just can't get any simpler than that).<br/>\n<strong><br/>\nCoT Multi-Class Adustment--PvM/E -AND- PvP (especially):</strong><br/>\nAh, but bring in CoT for the +5 sacred defense (and boost to reflex pre-ep) and the Man-at-Arms survivability in terms of PvP has just increased exponentially, where saves count (i.e., good saves across the board especially for a melee, with great fort, and with spellcraft maxed as well, the Man-at-Arms has nice saves v. spells across the board as well, with a super fort, and including a rather decent will which is quite rare to see on a melee build). In terms of PvP play, Sacred Defense really does shore up the saves, indeed; wonderful synergies with Fighter base class (as we discussed over on the Yardstick thread) and so much nicer to own such things as opposed to seeking out and/or buying potions, scrolls. (NOTE: as is the case of most melee, who tend to have a nice fort as original build shows, but that's about it barring potions, scrolls which isn't an issue PvM/E so far as will's among the easiest things to shore up, but not necessarily true when it comes to PvP play). In terms of PvP play, it's important to note that saves are very important, and moreover that hard saves (sacred defense, spellcraft, etc.) unlike scrolls can't be dispelled PvP either. This, because such saves (with CoT in the mix) are something that the Man-at-Arms actually and wholly owns. (NOTE: with the ability of course to shore them up further with scrolls, potions all the same, thanks to Bard, but in PvP you'll enjoy \"owning them\" from the get-go). <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Divine Wrath:</strong><br/>\nYes, CoT in addition gets Divine Wrath: opens up with any CHA item (incl. potion) and, when \"pulled\" automatically boosts saves further, along with a boost to AB and damage, too. (Note: 10 CoT, gives +5 more saves, +5 more AB and +5 damage, such damage being divine based meaning it can't be resisted either). Does the Man-at-Arms need it? Of course not, having a really nice (high) AB and wonderful damage set-up (high STR, WS/EWS and on all four weapons!), but nothing wrong with a little bit of extra icing on the cake, as they say. Just a little something in the back pocket per se, which can be cracked open in case of emergency. Like say you're up against some PG/RDD with an uber dev.crit DC or something. Heh, disarm with your big 2-hander or, better yet, pull on the Wrath and then do so, following through with the damage (already wonderful as is, just enhanced with the wrath, with disarm also enhancing AB/attack, not to mention your foe is going to have a hard time doing much of anything--much less any dev.crit--without their weapon). Meantime, by \"breaking the glass\" DW also gave Man-at-Arms an instant +5 fort (as in, an adj. Naked FORT 42 (51 v spells), self-buff). [Note: also just so happens that in the dev.crit game a DC 42 is essentially the highest possible DC a non-RDD can achieve barring magic gear, with whatever equipment your foe gets you also of course geting as well, so as to become a complete wash in turn, but will likewise not be doing any dev.critting much less much of anything without their weapon when disarmed either]. Yep, sounds pretty darn good to me, and while DW's just a bit of extra icing on the cake, the ability to open up a once-a-day ability isn't such a bad thing (as in, no need to panic, you see.  ). And yep, all of it for free!! (Well, apart from the CoT alignment requirement calling for any non-evil, which may be a problem PvM/E for those who enjoy walking the \"Dark Side\", but not generally a problem when it comes to PvP, ... <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers guys, and great discussion as always. I'll post the multi-class version on a thread of its own, though there's something definitely to be said for a simple and efficient 2-class structure, a well-rounded (very good/strong) warrior, with decent saves (nice fort, but definitely excluding will) (PvM/E) and no alignment restrictions when it comes to the good-evil axis either. [Note: Alignment issue notwithstanding, much better saves with CoT in the mix (making for an even stronger warrior in turn), and being the way to go for PvP especially where there's no such thing as too much saves, couldn't possibly agree with guys more!].<br/>\n<br/>\nSlash, Bludgeon and Pierce ON! ~ Tyr<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: added note about dev.crit. DCs (PvP), and AC adj. in multi-classed CoT build (if i.e. took AS instead of EP for PvM/E). Added note about alignment (i.e., CoT unlike FTR requires a non-evil alignment).</div>"
