      "content": "<div>I just threw this together for you. Unfortunately, there was no room for Improved Critical. the higher your Set trap skill, the higher the DC of traps you set, so I maxxed it. I also maxxed Disable trap to have the best chance of handling traps set by other players. UMD 33 will let you use any scroll.<br/>\n<br/>\n You could also optionally add a third gift for +2 WIS, which would give you +1 Will save and +1 AC. If you don't want to use gifts, each of which costs you a 1-point ECL penalty, causing you level more slowly, I could easy change it to use 1 gift (DEX only), or no gifts.<br/>\n<br/>\n It just occurred to me that it might be a good idea to replace those last two Great Dexterity feats with Epic Prowess and Armor Skin. This would result in no change for your AB, +1 for your AB, and -1 for your Reflex Saves. The down side is you would lose one point on some skills, like Hide and Move Silently and Set Trap.<br/>\n<br/>\n Something else just occurred to me. Maybe HiPS is nerfed in Arelith.
