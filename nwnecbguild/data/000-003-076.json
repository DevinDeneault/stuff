      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hello to everyone, i'm here to ask some help developing a build for a Ravenloft Based persistent world, roleplay based, with a max level of 20. (oh, low magic, means max+2/+3 items)<br/>\n<br/>\n I'd like to develop a Build with Palemaster (undead themed characters), but with a build focused on melee and combat (it mustn't be optimized, just an interesting build)<br/>\n<br/>\n Right now, i was thinking something like<br/>\n<br/>\n Bard6/Fighter4/PM10<br/>\n<br/>\n or<br/>\n<br/>\n Wiz6/Fight4/PM10<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n It would be a build based on sword and shield, good AC, heavy armor, and buffed with Still Spell casting.<br/>\n<br/>\n The advantage and disadvantage of the two:<br/>\n<br/>\n The Bard based:<br/>\n Pro:<br/>\n -Tumble skill that gives you +4 AC<br/>\n -higher BAB (+1)<br/>\n -level 6 bard song (+1hit,+2 damage)<br/>\n -higher lore<br/>\n -can level UMD<br/>\n -a little more HP<br/>\n -just need CHA 12<br/>\n<br/>\n Cons:<br/>\n -Just level 2 spell, so with still spell, you can use just level 1 spell<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Wizard based:<br/>\n<br/>\n Pro:<br/>\n -Spell level 6, so Still Spell level 5 spell<br/>\n -More buffs (ethereal visage)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Cons:<br/>\n -Less hp<br/>\n -Less BAB (-1)<br/>\n -Less AC from tumble (cross class skill may give +2 instead of +4)<br/>\n -no UMD<br/>\n -Need an INT point of 16 to works<br/>\n -More dependant on Rests (the server got rest restriction, so you can rest just in certain area)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n So, right now, this is my approach to the Build, but i'd like some different perspective and notes about this build, even considering different classes/level<br/>\n<br/>\n Consider that this server got Rest Restriction so it would be good even some perspective less based on spells.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Thank you to everyone for the attention and for any possible answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

With all those PM levels, your AB will be so low you will have trouble hitting anything. You could squeeze one more AB into either variation if you take 6 levels of Fighter and 4 levels of the caster. Maybe somebody more practiced with casters could help salvage this idea.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It might help with getting the problems for a level 20 build sorted when set next to how it could work at level 40. I know that's bugger all use for your Ravenloft PW, but it's an interesting build regardless.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

With Bard6 / PM10, you will have the same number of spell slots, as a lvl 11 bard, but you will only know the number of spells as a lvl 6 Bard (and the leveling order is irrelevant). This way you can use the 3rd level slots to still your 2nd level spells, or even the 4th level slots to empower them, but you will not know any 3rd or 4th level spells. AFAIK you don't need more than a base CHA of 12 as long as you can find charisma enhancing items to open and fill the higher level slots with metamagic. However you said your world is low magic, so a base value of 13 at least is advised I think.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I have tried to build something for you, but I end up cutting down on the PM levels all the time. Pre epic PM is bad for AB in a combat build, and bad for spell casting in a mage build. In a \"spell-sword\" It ends up crippling both parts that are hard pressed in the first place.<br/>\n My advice if you want to keep some playability, is to build a straight wizard, play it as a melee mage in combat and role-play it as a necromancer preoccupied with bone-lore. You can do the same thing with cleric and get a character with much stronger melee presence.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That way Perform ends at 29, so you will need a minor boost to Charisma, or a skill enhancing item to be able to sing the level 16 song properly.<br/>\n But my point: It is no longer a Pale Master. IMO Crit immunity only reaches its potential in an epic environment with Dev Crit. The PM AC bonus is normally not worth the pre epic loss of BAB. The summons and once per day touch attack have limited value.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
