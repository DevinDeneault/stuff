      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The original build can found <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100128225734/http://nwn.bioware.com/underdark/character_wrathfulberserker.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nCreated by Anuis a.k.a. Joey B.<br/>\nIndispensable Edit Guy: Doug_G <br/>\nReformatted by HipMaestro &amp; pals, 110914<br/>\n<br/>\nThe burnished knights on their horses were being savaged by the club-wielding brute whose deep rumbling laugh frayed the nerves of even most stalwart. The creature stood more than twice the height of an average man wore foul-smelling leathers and an eye patch made of human skin. Its teeth had grown out and over its rubbery lips to form yellowed and broken daggers flecked with old blood and gristle. It smashes a company of cavalry attempting to release the pressure on a company of foot soldiers who had been scattered with a few great swings of that fire-hardened club. The soldiers fight back but are simply no match for this threat.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Come beast, look upon doom!\" The bloody valley shook with the power and resonance of this new voice. The giant turns at the sound, seeing a man of hard muscles and snaking blue tattoos step free from the forest. He wears a vicious black helmet of crude spikes and jagged metal. In his hands he swings an axe spotted with the blackish blood of the giant kind. He strides forward, like a rolling avalanche, batting away the giant's minions; his axe hewing a lethal path until he stands before the giant. The man lets out a mighty roar that shatters the brief quiet on the war field. The sound crashes upon the minions and sends them fleeing in a blind panic. The giant's heart grows faint at the sound, and drops its club to cover its ears. \"May death take you!\"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Wrathful Berserker cut deep into the cowering figure before him.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe theme of this build is to make the best use of terrifying rage. The Wrathful Berserker then follows up his rage effect with liberal use of devastating criticals against those who are terrified. Nothing can withstand this particular build except those who have high saves against the fear effect of the rage.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce a victim is terrified, they cannot defend themselves against the blows of the berserker's axe. Even without the devastating critical, the damage is still enough to hurt most creatures for the duration of the effect. The damage can be even higher if traveling in a group of clerics, wizards, and/or sorcerers who can supplement or enhance the Berserker's efforts. The Wrathful Berserker's weapon preference is the great axe, and he is a true embodiment of fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of items, he should equip heavy armor type; full plate is preferred along with the great axe. Other items really don't matter since this build is made to not to rely on any stat boosters, but if that is wanted, anything with CON and STR and/or CHA boost is best to use. If you are going to encounter a creature that is powerful, such as a boss monster on the server, you will need to get items that will heal you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbarian(32), Fighter(8), Human, True Neutral vs. smites (else, any Non-lawful, per Hip 110914)<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 16 (28)<br/>\nDEX: 15<br/>\nCON: 15 (16)<br/>\nWIS: 10<br/>\nINT: 10<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Fighter(1): Toughness, Dodge, Mobility<br/>\n02: Fighter(2): Power Attack<br/>\n03: Barbarian(1): Cleave<br/>\n04: Barbarian(2): CON+1, (CON=16)<br/>\n05: Barbarian(3)<br/>\n06: Barbarian(4): Great Cleave<br/>\n07: Barbarian(5)<br/>\n08: Barbarian(6): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n09: Barbarian(7): Improved Critical: Greataxe<br/>\n10: Fighter(3)<br/>\n11: Barbarian(8)<br/>\n12: Barbarian(9): STR+1, Weapon Focus: Greataxe, (STR=18)<br/>\n13: Barbarian(10)<br/>\n14: Barbarian(11)<br/>\n15: Fighter(4): Knockdown, Weapon Specialization: Greataxe<br/>\n16: Barbarian(12): STR+1, (STR=19)<br/>\n17: Barbarian(13)<br/>\n18: Barbarian(14): Iron Will<br/>\n19: Barbarian(15)<br/>\n20: Fighter(5): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n21: Fighter(6): Epic Weapon Focus: Greataxe, Epic Weapon Specialization: Greataxe<br/>\n22: Barbarian(16)<br/>\n23: Barbarian(17)<br/>\n24: Fighter(7): STR+1, Improved Power Attack, (STR=21)<br/>\n25: Fighter(8): Epic Prowess<br/>\n26: Barbarian(18)<br/>\n27: Barbarian(19): Terrifying Rage<br/>\n28: Barbarian(20): STR+1, (STR=22)<br/>\n29: Barbarian(21)<br/>\n30: Barbarian(22): Great Strength I, (STR=23)<br/>\n31: Barbarian(23)<br/>\n32: Barbarian(24): STR+1, Overwhelming Critical: Greataxe, (STR=24)<br/>\n33: Barbarian(25): Great Strength II, (STR=25)<br/>\n34: Barbarian(26)<br/>\n35: Barbarian(27)<br/>\n36: Barbarian(28): STR+1, Devastating Critical: Greataxe, Thundering Rage, (STR=26)<br/>\n37: Barbarian(29)<br/>\n38: Barbarian(30)<br/>\n39: Barbarian(31): Great Strength III, (STR=27)<br/>\n40: Barbarian(32): STR+1, Epic Toughness I, (STR=28)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 644<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 26/18/18<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Traps: +5<br/>\nBAB: 30<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 43 (melee), 33 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 16/26<br/>\n<br/>\nSkillpoints: 193<br/>\nDiscipline 43(52), Intimidate 40(39), Taunt 43(42), Tumble 21(23), remaining 25<br/>\n<br/>\nNote:  The skill distribution template of the original build was incomplete.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Following in the grand tradition of Mick and Valerfor offering updated versions of some of our legacy builds, I thought I'd re-examine the Wrathful Berserker. I've kept the underpinning principles the same, but tightened up on a few things - including adding a third class. Mostly it's marginal, but his AB, AC (though still sucky), saves, DC for both Dev Crit and Terrifying Rage are higher, and he has increased his skill points. Of course, there are some losses as well as gains. He loses 28 hit points, 1 Greater Rage, along with some frankly superfluous feats and the ability to be evil. I've also given him a heavy flail, because I like them (and they're great when Rage and Dev Crit don't work, against undead, for example), but a great sword/axe is still viable. I believe it is an improvement, but I'll let you be the judge of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nApoplectic Berserker<br/>\nBarbarian 28/ Fighter 4/ CoT 8<br/>\nHuman - any non-evil, non-lawful<br/>\n<br/>\nStats<br/>\nSTR 16 (30)<br/>\nDEX 12<br/>\nCON 16<br/>\nWIS 8<br/>\nINT 12<br/>\nCHA 8<br/>\n<br/>\nHPs: 616<br/>\nAC: (naked) 17, (full plate) 25, (+tower shield) 28<br/>\nSaves: Fortitude 35, Will 20, Reflex 23.

Better AB, AC, saves and critical skills - and a more focused build altogether.<br/>\nIf I should suggest anything at all, it would be to add a Tumble class as a minor class for skill dumps, to add valuable AC to this two-hander build. Bard (a non-lawful class to boot) could also improve the Spellcraft and the saves vs spells with the same investment in skill points.<br/>\nYou would of course lose the Fighter/CoT synergy with improved saves together with EWS, and a possible XP penalty may become an issue.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks Mick!<br/>\n<br/>\nTo avoid that xp penalty, and totally reverse the alignment, Assassin might well be viable. Something like a Barbarian 32/ Fighter 6/ Assassin 2 (both in epic levels), with a B16/ F4 split pre-epic. I appreciate the cross-classed skill investment in Hide and MS, but more points would be available in any case. Toughness could be lost pre-epic (still leaving a very healthy HP pool), but I'd have to drop 2 Great Strengths in epic levels, bringing the Dev Crit DC down to 39 and losing 1 AB. Barbarian 32 gives one more bonus feat, so I'd be losing 2 CoT ones, but I don't really see the point in dropping AS and EP, when AC already needs attention and 1 AB would still be lost. And I'd rather keep the TR DC as high as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorth pursuing?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

However, the prime focus of this beast is offence, making use of TR to scythe away the chaff, then following up with KD and Dev Crit. The hope is to get in, get it done quick, and get out. A deep HP pool and DR helps with those blows he does take, and travelling in the company of a buffer and healer would aid significantly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is my long-winded way of saying that I think I'll keep him as is.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
