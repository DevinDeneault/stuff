First, let's qualify your request a bit further.... a bit longish.<br/>\n<br/>\n You are actually requesting TWO builds... one for the Original Campaign (OC), i.e. the \"Plague Campaign\" and another discrete build for the Shadows of Undrentide (SoU) thru Hordes of the Underdark (HotU) expansions.\u00a0 If you play solo (meaning: complete every quest and all combat opportunities without using hirelings or summons much at all for battles), you can expect to reach level 18 for the OC, level 12-14 for SoU and level 12-14 thru level 28 for HotU.\u00a0 The OC is considered to be a learning campaign where many of the challenges have been toned down and loot is rather easy to accrue. The SoU thru HotU series is much harder by design.\u00a0 It will test your build's optimizations better, especially the abridged and stingy SoU modules (there are 3 acts in that campaign).<br/>\n<br/>\n My advice, as a new player, is to focus on the OC toon first, test out the waters and then decide if your original plan should have some tweaks, or else even go in another direction altogether.\u00a0 You could just play the same 1-18 levels with the same design for the SoU-HotU adventure, but who knows?\u00a0 You can always change your mind or at least decide on certain aspects of the build that may need to be altered to broaden the experience or the potential.\u00a0 Sound like a plan?\u00a0 Hope so.<br/>\n<br/>\n What you seem to be inferring is a spellsword, an arcane caster that has sufficient melee prowess to be able to buff and go hand-to-hand against most opponents while still retaining strong offensive casting power.\u00a0 That means minimal use of polymorph forms like Tenser's Transformation. The most effective combination would probably be the Paladin-Sorcerer CHA synergy, typically employing Divine Might and Divine Shield to bolster their combat effectiveness.\u00a0 In this case, a human would be best to avoid a -20% combat experience penalty..\u00a0 An elven Paladin-Wizard would also avoid the penalty, but lose out on the synergy since that combo would need to be an INT-focused build.\u00a0 In the OC, a CHA build has further non-combat advantages in regards to Persuade checks so consider that in your decision.\u00a0 Either build will be forced to maintain Lawful Good alignment so you may find yourself a fallen paladin if you stray too far from the RP aspects and lose your lawful ranking (there are many opportunities in the OC to regain accidental evil actions by good ones, but none to counter lawlessness).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n So, just off the top of my head, without outlining any particulars, my instinct is to recommend something like Pal 4/ Src 14 with an ability spread of STR 16 (18), DEX 8, CON 14, WIS 8, INT 12, CHA 16(18) and using feats Power Attack, Still Spell (if wearing full armor or Extend Spell in robes... choose your option), Divine Shield, Divine Might, Weapon Focus (any one-hand), Improved Critical, Blind Fight, Knockdown.\u00a0 That assures the toon will have Level 7 spells (Level 6 stilled) available for the final battle.\u00a0 The spread would probably need to be modified slightly to enable Improved Knockdown for a Level 28 build, but let's postpone that idea for the moment.\u00a0 RDD may come into play in an extended version but never intended to be part of the OC.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Please read, consider and digest and then decide what your bias is.\u00a0 If you have never played NWN before, spellcasting can take some practice.\u00a0 There are many nuances unique to the game, so spellsword may not fit your learning curve well.\u00a0 You be the judge.\u00a0 If I have echoed a lot of information about the game you've already become familiar with... well... better safe than sorry, eh?</div>"

Check the <strong><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#0000FF\">NWN wiki</span></a></strong> to help you resolve most of your questions and the ECB will fill in any remaining issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n It's not that you CAN'T run a single toon through all the campaigns.\u00a0 It's just not what was intended.\u00a0 Trying to start SoU with a level 18 toon is pretty much a waste of time because there will be no challenge PLUS you will be dragging all the uber gear, loot and gold over which is so not what SoU was designed for.\u00a0 As I stated before: it is stingy.\u00a0 Gold is hard to acquire and gear is far more limiting.\u00a0 Bioware created SoU to better reflect how the game should be balanced rather than a casual walk through the park requiring little strategy or care.\u00a0 Trust me.\u00a0 When you have become comfortable with your success with the OC, that will mark the beginning of what the true NWN experience has to offer.\u00a0 * 'nuff preaching *<br/>\n<br/>\n Here is Valerfor's yardstick build, modified slightly to account for the OC level limitations.\u00a0 Skills have been modified slightly.\u00a0 Concentration is worthless to any non-caster (a pally is a self-buffer rather than an offensive spellcaster) in an environment where there is no opposed threat of being taunted.\u00a0 None of the Bioware campaigns have introduced taunting into the creature AI so you can save skill investment from Concentration for custom content where it is a factor.\u00a0 Also, notice the value I've placed on Extend Spell to lengthen the duration of Divine Favor and Prayer, specifically, while the toon is still in its early stages.\u00a0 The +12 CHA cap should be relatively easy to reach by combining Eagle's Splendor/Aura of Glory buffs with common nymph cloaks resulting in a final CHA 28 (+9 modifier).\u00a0 Fully capped, that's a dozen turn attempts per day which should be more than enough in an environment with unlimited resting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>OC Pally 18</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n Paladin(18),\u00a0 Lawful Good Human<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 15 (18)<br/>\n DEX: 8<br/>\n CON: 12<br/>\n WIS: 14<br/>\n INT: 12<br/>\n CHA: 15 (16)<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Paladin(1): Power Attack, Weapon Focus<br/>\n 02: Paladin(2)<br/>\n 03: Paladin(3): Divine Shield<br/>\n 04: Paladin(4): STR+1 (16)<br/>\n 05: Paladin(5)<br/>\n 06: Paladin(6): Extend Spell<br/>\n 07: Paladin(7)<br/>\n 08: Paladin(8): STR+1 (17)<br/>\n 09: Paladin(9): Blind Fight<br/>\n 10: Paladin(10)<br/>\n 11: Paladin(11)<br/>\n 12: Paladin(12): CHA+1 (16), Knockdown<br/>\n 13: Paladin(13)<br/>\n 14: Paladin(14)<br/>\n 15: Paladin(15): Divine Might<br/>\n 16: Paladin(16): STR+1 (18)<br/>\n 17: Paladin(17)<br/>\n 18: Paladin(18): Improved Critical<br/>\n<br/>\n HP: 198<br/>\n Saves (F/W/R): 15/11/8\u00a0 (17/13/10 vs spells)<br/>\n BAB: 18<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 23 (melee), 17 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 11/22<br/>\n<br/>\n Skills@Level 18<br/>\n Discipline 21(25), Heal 4(6), Spellcraft 9(10), Taunt 21(24), Tumble 10(9)<br/>\n<br/>\n Schedule<br/>\n 01: Discipline(4), Spellcraft(2), Taunt(4), Tumble(2)<br/>\n 02: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(2)<br/>\n 03: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1)<br/>\n 04: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(2)<br/>\n 05: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1)<br/>\n 06: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(2)<br/>\n 07: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1)<br/>\n 08: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(2)<br/>\n 09: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1)<br/>\n 10: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(2)<br/>\n 11: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1)<br/>\n 12: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(2)<br/>\n 13: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1)<br/>\n 14: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(2)<br/>\n 15: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1)<br/>\n 16: Discipline(1), Heal(2), Taunt(1)<br/>\n 17: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1)<br/>\n 18: Discipline(1), Heal(2), Taunt(1)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n I hope this is helpful enough for you to just start playing without concerns about how/when to allocate your resources.\u00a0 Report back when you have finished your pally test before deciding how to approach a first-time spellcaster build.\u00a0 We'd like to know the details of the experience as new builds are being recommended for your playstyle.\u00a0 Good luck!</div>\n</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">Thank you! i will test it and see what happens.</div></div>"

Of the two campaign choices that you have, the second is the best one and involves your character going through SoU to HoTU and finish somewhere between 27-28 lvl. I saw that Hip already provided you with a build for the OC, so i will provide you with another, different one, for the SoU to HoTU campaign. This one is based to the \"Puissant Paladin\" by Theophilus Fist and myself which can be found in the same thread as the holy knight, later on. The Puissant Paladin has two main differences from the Holy Knight. First, it completely forfeits charisma as a factor in this build, so the option of using Divine Might and Shield isn't there (but read on and i will explain why). Secondly, Puissant Paladin attains the dreaded \"Devastating Critical\" and he does so, with the maximum Human DC!
