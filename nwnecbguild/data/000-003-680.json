Move on if you didn't get it.]<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway there are some cool things about Bard-orcerers. One is the Bard song which immediately makes you popular with everyone. Second is the huge number of spells/day and spells available to use. Third is that you dont have to memorise your spells just rest whenever and you can cast whatever you want whenever.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are weaknesses of course. I've tried to address some of them. Firstly the build is feat starved. I felt the best approach would be to abandon all thoughts of being a combatant, avoiding all those feats like Blind Fight/Knockdown/WF/EWF/EP, and embrace the lifestyle of being a singer and spell-slinger hence the title.<br/>\n<br/>\n[Although he could also equip a sling as well to be a <strong>singer, slinger and spell-slinger</strong>, he is going to be an inaccurate slinger.]<br/>\n<br/>\nBard/ Sorcerer have atrocious d4/d6 hit die so I've opted for a cons based non-DC spell caster, add EDR III.<br/>\n<br/>\nDispels are the final issue I can see.\u00a0I've opted for undispellability (at level 40) which is pretty standard for a spellsword to get this late 30s-40 but will need to be managed carefully avoiding dispels until you get to 40 by which time you can retire the character (lol).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nDamage shields would be strong here with extended wounding whispers, death armor, flame shield and mestil's acid sheath, although not having critical hit immunity will be problematic, one might have to utilise the Shapechange (Iron Golem) approach if you want to use this optimally, until Epic Spell: Epic Warding is obtained.<br/>\n<br/>\nI definitely wanted a level 16 Bard/Curse Song in the build, just too powerful to give up.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeaps of craft magic in the build (Scribe Scroll/craft wand), with dual spell books seemed silly not to take it, and will make you even more popular than you already were.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSomehow I fit in the ability to set and craft deadly traps into the build which is nice too.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway this guy is looking like a bit of a 'rock star', feel free to review, suggestions/tweaks always welcome<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Bard(16), Sorcerer(24), Human\nSTR: 10\nCON: 16 (24)\nINT: 14\n\n01: Bard(1): Scribe Scroll, Lingering Song\n03: Sorcerer(2): Extend Spell\n05: Sorcerer(4)\n07: Bard(3)\n09: Sorcerer(5): Craft Wand\n11: Sorcerer(7)\n13: Bard(5)\n15: Bard(7): Spell Penetration\n17: Bard(9)\n19: Bard(11)\n21: Bard(13): Epic Damage Reduction I\n23: Bard(15)\n25: Sorcerer(9)\n27: Sorcerer(11): Epic Damage Reduction III\n29: Sorcerer(13)\n31: Sorcerer(15)\n33: Sorcerer(17): Epic Fortitude\n35: Sorcerer(19)\n37: Sorcerer(21)\n39: Sorcerer(23): Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor, Epic Spell: Epic Warding\n\nSkillpoints: 253\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9\nAB (max, naked): 23 (melee), 23 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Bard(6),Sorcerer(9)\n\n\n01: Concentration(4), Craft Trap(4), Disable Trap(1), Listen(4), Lore(1), Open Lock(1), Perform(1), Set Trap(1), Tumble(4), UMD(4),\u00a0\n03: Concentration(1), Lore(2), Save(3),\u00a0\n05: Concentration(1), Save(11),\u00a0\n07: Concentration(1), Listen(1), Perform(3), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n09: Concentration(1), Craft Trap(2), Spellcraft(1), Save(2),\u00a0\n11: Concentration(1), Craft Trap(1), Save(7),\u00a0\n13: Concentration(1), Craft Trap(1), Listen(5), Tumble(5), UMD(5),\u00a0\n15: Concentration(1), Craft Trap(1), Listen(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n17: Concentration(1), Craft Trap(1), Listen(1), Tumble(5), UMD(5),\u00a0\n19: Concentration(1), Craft Trap(1), Listen(1), Perform(3), Set Trap(1),\u00a0\n21: Concentration(1), Listen(1), Save(9),\u00a0\n23: Concentration(1), Listen(1), Perform(3), Set Trap(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n25: Concentration(1), Set Trap(2),\u00a0\n27: Concentration(1), Set Trap(2),\u00a0\n29: Concentration(1), Set Trap(1), Spellcraft(3),\u00a0\n31: Concentration(1), Set Trap(1), Spellcraft(3),\u00a0\n33: Concentration(1), Set Trap(1), Spellcraft(3),\u00a0\n35: Concentration(1), Set Trap(1), Spellcraft(3),\u00a0\n37: Concentration(1), Craft Trap(1), Spellcraft(3),\u00a0\n39: Concentration(1), Craft Trap(1), Spellcraft(3),\u00a0</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

My goal was to try to make a spellsword with undispellable Sorcerer magic and the lvl 16 Bard songs.<br/>\nI chose to let the mage part focus primarily on non save spells with the low DC and a fair chance to penetrate the standard item based SR 32. The combat part is dex based and AB is OK'ish. It\u00a0 improves with taunt and the songs active. Damage relies heavily on buffs.<br/>\nDamage shields work best in golem shape with the added immunities and hitpoints.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
