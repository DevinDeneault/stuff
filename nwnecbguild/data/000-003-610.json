      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">This looks like a Dex based Robe wearin' Wis pumped Monkey.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith no way to tie down the Dex AC (no Uncanny Dodge), I can see why Wis has been taken here.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, it really looks like AB is suffering here, and for no real purpose that I can discern.\u00a0 Taking 8 levels of Monk pre-epic lowers the AB by 2 (I can honestly see taking 4, to get the Kamas w/o burning up a feat, but I don't really see a purpose for taking 8).<br/>\n<br/>\nSince WoG has spamming effects that force lots of saves, you will eventually roll a 1 and fail, regardless of saves.\u00a0 So immunities is where it's at.\u00a0 It is the only thing that will save you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would drop all the save boosters for other, more meaningful feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis build will have major problems dishing out damage on WoG, where DR is a standard feature on most m0bs, not to mention Bosses.\u00a0 Hitting at high levels will also start to become a problem, as the AB is a tick low for this type of build.\u00a0 It will basically be a 20 hunting build.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's got some good elements that just need to be re-applied differently to be optimized for WoG play IMO.\u00a0 I personally would go \"all in\" on Dex here.\u00a0 Drop 4 levels of Monk pre-epic and move them to Epic.\u00a0 That will automatically get this build 1 AB.\u00a0 The Dex will get a lot more as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Kamas on WoG are very unexciting (best standard drop are Dragon Claws, +3, 1d6 fire, keen), this build will be hunting for that precious Kama no kama drop or socket kama w/gems (custom kama).<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally have mostly given up on Kamas on WoG - one can get by a little (mostly m0bs) but Bosses laugh at your kamas.\u00a0 Even a woodpecker build has problems on WoG at the upper end of the spectrum.<br/>\n<br/>\nFighting Kama<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk25/Fighter8/Weaponmaster7 (Monk 12/Fighter 9/WM 19) - this build I abandoned as it performs subpar on WoG.\u00a0 It is great against m0bs, but Bosses wreck it, fast.\u00a0 Even after tweaking, it just looses out to all fist options (which is what I go with primarily on WoG now).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs already suggested, Spring Attack and Dodge can go - one can get Dodge on some boots (with KD immune) and Spring Attack and Mobility will not be necessary with enough Tumble.\u00a0 Invest in more Dex or...yeah, more Dex.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, this build has no way to \"tie down\" that Dex bonus to AC.\u00a0 It is a major problem with this build, and is one I ran into with a similar type build (kama quisinart - Fighting Kama above) - once this build hits a wall of opponents, it gets wrecked on WoG as AC plummets.\u00a0 A class with Uncanny Dodge or another way to avoid being flatfooted (Barb/Rog/Ass or DD) would really go a long way here to helping that out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more I play on WoG, the more I see two paths - either the AC Junkie that really needs to protect all sources of AC (and this AC needs to be insanely high, like 80+ at a minimum as most End Bosses on WoG can easily hit anything in the 70s) OR a DR, immunity based Regen Wall of Pain that cannot be critted.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I have both types of builds on WoG at level 40, I can attest to the later.\u00a0 Nightshade (Monk 34/SD5/Ass1) is an exception, but even it reaches limits unless supremely optimized (which, while possible on WoG, is very, very difficult to achieve).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Kamas, they are basically useless on WoG for End boss hunting.\u00a0 I once used to party up with a Monk/Pally based character who had a Legendary Holy Avenger Kama on WoG - and even that character was struggling vs End Bosses O_o<br/>\n<br/>\nM0bs had no chance against her, however.<br/>\n<br/>\nIF one can party up with a high level Bard, that can change things drastically.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here is what I would suggest - move 4 levels of Monk to post Epic (+1 AB).\u00a0 Drop the whole Dodge/Mobility/Spring Attack and get Zen Archery (one can get a sweet shortbow that is really nice for a Monk!\u00a0 Or Xbows, if that is your thing) so that one has the travel and range thing out of the way.\u00a0 The Disarm feats might be a viable option here.\u00a0 Disarm on WoG (esp. Improved Disarm) is a very underappreciated feat imo.\u00a0 Kamas are tiny, so they are not optimal for this feat, but it should still work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would personally drop all the save boosting feats as well and invest in other, more useful feats (like perhaps some skill focuses SF:Concentration, etc).\u00a0 WoG m0bs and Bosses love to Taunt.\u00a0 As a Kama wielder, one wants to also lock down that Discipline (vs Disarm).<br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest changing the alignment to Lawful Evil - there are very good reasons for this.\u00a0 Evil on WoG seems to get the best access to advantageous items if they do not have UMD (UMD users on WoG are \"teh chizz\" - ultimate builds, really).\u00a0 There are very good items on WoG especially for this type of build that all require one to be evil to use.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's my $.02<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Mind immunity comes late at lvl 40 so the will save isn't totally wasted if your clarity gets dispelled.\u00a0<br/>\n- 50% undispellable concealment for 20 rounds is pretty awesome (Empty Body x2/day) sounds awesome<br/>\n- lightning fast speed around the vast maps of WoG is fabulous with high tumble and excellent tactical capabilities during battle<br/>\n<br/>\nTweaks might be:\u00a0<br/>\n- add a few points to Base AB aiming for 38-40 (increasing dex at the cost of wisdom for example) if you can<br/>\n- if you have an excess of combat feats, you could lower fighter to 6 and increase total CoT levels to 14 for better saves<br/>\n- I would drop some points from heal and put them into search for secret door and trap detection (maybe 5-10 crossclassed skill points),\u00a0<br/>\n- Tumble doesn't have to be 43 it can be 40 for maximal AC bonus (+8), take your last monk level at 37 for mind immunity and a rapid push to 40<br/>\n- Con 8 is slightly low for a meleer (160[monk20]+200[fighter10cot10] -40[con 8] +40[toughness] = 360 max) but some players prefer that, I like 400-500 base HP on my meleers so its a bit more forgiving<br/>\n- wish it had UMD, uncanny dodge, epic dodge but that is a different build<br/>\n- I would try to get one crossclassed point in open lock, set trap and disable trap as a dexer, these can be handy skills<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

For example, I'd have had to take the potential Dex penalty from the lack of UD into account - so I can see how you try to counter-balance that with a higher Wis ranking (which strangely enough might have been better with Ranger, for the spell buffs). I might also have been tempted to take the first Monk level at L2 rather than waiting until 7, to get both the Kama proficiency nice and early as well as an early bump to AC from Tumble (though I still wouldn't be wearing robes until more Monk levels were taken). With Fighter in there instead of Ranger, I'd also be looking at taking feats like WS and Blind Fight earlier than the dual-wielding feats, but that may well just be me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other issue with Fighter over Ranger here is about skill points. You get less of them, so can't grab enough for Hide and Move Silently. While I understand Taunt is prevalent on WoG, so is pretty well everyone sneaking you. So (and this is with no experience of the PW) I might be tempted to drop Heal and Concentration for the stealth skills (though dropping Discipline is a potentially viable thought in a Dex build, too).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thoughts. Once you've got the whole thing finalized to your satisfaction, and you feel it's as optimized as you can get it, let me, Mick or Empyre know, and we can move it to the Level 40s section.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Improved Disarm) is a very underappreciated feat imo.\u00a0 Kamas are tiny, so they are not optimal for this feat, but it should still work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would personally drop all the save boosting feats as well and invest in other, more useful feats (like perhaps some skill focuses SF:Concentration, etc).\u00a0 WoG m0bs and Bosses love to Taunt.\u00a0 As a Kama wielder, one wants to also lock down that Discipline (vs Disarm).<br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest changing the alignment to Lawful Evil - there are very good reasons for this.\u00a0 Evil on WoG seems to get the best access to advantageous items if they do not have UMD (UMD users on WoG are \"teh chizz\" - ultimate builds, really).\u00a0 There are very good items on WoG especially for this type of build that all require one to be evil to use.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's my $.02</div></blockquote>\nI just followed the level progression of the Crimson Nun of Pain. If I only take 4 monk pre epic, what would be good for the other 4 and where?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would be considered more meaningful feats?<br/>\n<br/>\nI was able to get my hands on both a 6 and 4 socketed kamas which I put divine and positive energy damage on both. I feel like my damage is doing okay atm but not super sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould it be worth it to remove either fighter or CoT for a class with access to uncanny dodge? I would like to be able to dish out and take as much as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nIm not too worried about damage later as one of my party members is running with a high lvl bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust saw some of the feat suggestions for skills.. noted.. thank you!<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a way to change my alignment without the help of a DM?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for all of the helpful suggestions!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I also did not know that 8 was the max tumble AC! And i thought about having a few points in those Dex skills but wasnt super sure.

For example, I'd have had to take the potential Dex penalty from the lack of UD into account - so I can see how you try to counter-balance that with a higher Wis ranking (which strangely enough might have been better with Ranger, for the spell buffs). I might also have been tempted to take the first Monk level at L2 rather than waiting until 7, to get both the Kama proficiency nice and early as well as an early bump to AC from Tumble (though I still wouldn't be wearing robes until more Monk levels were taken). With Fighter in there instead of Ranger, I'd also be looking at taking feats like WS and Blind Fight earlier than the dual-wielding feats, but that may well just be me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other issue with Fighter over Ranger here is about skill points. You get less of them, so can't grab enough for Hide and Move Silently. While I understand Taunt is prevalent on WoG, so is pretty well everyone sneaking you. So (and this is with no experience of the PW) I might be tempted to drop Heal and Concentration for the stealth skills (though dropping Discipline is a potentially viable thought in a Dex build, too).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thoughts. Once you've got the whole thing finalized to your satisfaction, and you feel it's as optimized as you can get it, let me, Mick or Empyre know, and we can move it to the Level 40s section.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div></blockquote>\nThank you for the advice.

Essentially, every level you take in a weapon-based class will give you +1 BAB (these include Fighter, Barbarian, Ranger, CoT, DwD, Paladin, Blackguard, Weapon Master, AA, and PDK). Those classes that give more \"variety\" (Bard, Rogue, RDD, SD, Cleric, Druid, Monk, Assassin, Shifter, and HS) will not add any BAB at their 1st, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels (hence what has become known as the Rule of Four, as three out of each four levels taken will get +1 BAB). Finally, those, classes that (on their own) want little to do with weapons (Sorcerer, Wizard, Pale Master) get +1 BAB every second level you take in the class. In epic levels, everyone - regardless of class - gets +1BAB on every odd level of the build. So the maximum BAB can be is 30, and its minimum is 20.<br/>\n<br/>\nIgnoring the Monk class, which is a special case and doesn't need going into just here, the most attacks per round a melee build can achieve (without Haste and single-handed) is 4, and you need a BAB of 16+ pre-epic in order to achieve that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that makes sense and helps a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: As has just been pointed out to me, it's actually possible to go as low as a minimum BAB of 19, should you really be searching for the bottom of the BAB barrel (thanks, Orion!)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
