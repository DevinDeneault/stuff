Just some fun away from the forum agreement in the other place not to talk about this.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here's the game - post one Epic build that you know / hope can gather solo as many of the rod parts possible maybe even see off Secret Pants themself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a few words why.<br/>\n<br/>\nRules?  How about:<br/>\n<br/>\n* No assumption of a perma-haste item<br/>\n* Equipment that is common loot / Boss drop OK<br/>\n* You have access to crafted wands<br/>\n<br/>\nLet the game begin!<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my SM-T810 using Tapatalk<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>"
