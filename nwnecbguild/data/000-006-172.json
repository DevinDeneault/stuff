      "content": "<div>For along time now I've been wanting a Paladin Sorc spellsword. \u00a0But every time I try and make one all I can see is major feat starvation. \u00a0From looking at the paladins spellbook it looks like they should compliment a spellsword nicely.<br/>\n<br/>\nGoals:<br/>\n1. \u00a0Full paladin spellbook<br/>\n2. \u00a0Full Sorcerer spellbook<br/>\n3. \u00a0Tumble class for skill dumps.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the following is what I've been able to come up with. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe downside's?<br/>\n<br/>\n1. \u00a0Lower AB (fairly normal for a spellsword)<br/>\n2. \u00a0No spell penetration feats<br/>\n3. \u00a0No Blind fight. \u00a0(Though I'd be sorely tempted to exchange empower spell for blind fight.)<br/>\n4. \u00a0No scribe scroll or craft wand<br/>\n5. \u00a0EXP penalty from lvl 13 onward<br/>\n<br/>\nPro's<br/>\n1. \u00a0Full paladin spellbook<br/>\n2. \u00a0Epic Sorcerer<br/>\n3. \u00a0Full Autostill.<br/>\n4. \u00a0Divine Might and Shield with decent charisma to back it up (can also self buff charisma for better usage)<br/>\n<br/>\nOut of curiosity, I made the same char with Fighter instead and ended up with like 7-8 more feats due to the \u00a0bonus feats. \u00a0And replacing with wizard gets more feats and skill points, but lower DS/DM due to gimped charisma. \u00a0This gal does meet all of my initial goals, so it isn't a complete loss. \u00a0But is there a way to make a decent pally/sorc? Does the paladin spellbook make up for the missing feats? or are they all gimped and thats why no one uses them....<br/>\n<br/>\nSorcerer(23), Paladin(15), Rogue(2), Human<br/>\nLawful Good, PVM<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 14 (22)<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 12<br/>\nWIS: 12 (14)<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 16 (20)<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Sorcerer(1): Still Spell, Power Attack<br/>\n02: Paladin(1)<br/>\n03: Sorcerer(2): Weapon Focus: Longsword<br/>\n04: Sorcerer(3): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n05: Sorcerer(4)<br/>\n06: Paladin(2): Extend Spell, {Smite Evil}<br/>\n07: Paladin(3)<br/>\n08: Paladin(4): STR+1, (STR=18)<br/>\n09: Paladin(5): Divine Might<br/>\n10: Paladin(6)<br/>\n11: Paladin(7)<br/>\n12: Paladin(8): WIS+1, Knockdown, (WIS=13)<br/>\n13: Rogue(1)<br/>\n14: Paladin(9)<br/>\n15: Paladin(10): Divine Shield<br/>\n16: Paladin(11): WIS+1, (WIS=14)<br/>\n17: Paladin(12)<br/>\n18: Paladin(13): Empower Spell<br/>\n19: Paladin(14)<br/>\n20: Sorcerer(5): CHA+1, (CHA=17)<br/>\n21: Sorcerer(6): Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword<br/>\n22: Sorcerer(7)<br/>\n23: Sorcerer(8)<br/>\n24: Sorcerer(9): CHA+1, Great Strength I, (STR=21), (CHA=18)<br/>\n25: Sorcerer(10)<br/>\n26: Sorcerer(11)<br/>\n27: Sorcerer(12): Great Strength II, (STR=22)<br/>\n28: Sorcerer(13): CHA+1, (CHA=19)<br/>\n29: Sorcerer(14)<br/>\n30: Sorcerer(15): Great Strength III, (STR=23)<br/>\n31: Sorcerer(16)<br/>\n32: Sorcerer(17): CHA+1, (CHA=20)<br/>\n33: Sorcerer(18): Great Strength IV, (STR=24)<br/>\n34: Sorcerer(19)<br/>\n35: Sorcerer(20)<br/>\n36: Sorcerer(21): STR+1, Automatic Still Spell I, (STR=25)<br/>\n37: Rogue(2): {Evasion}<br/>\n38: Sorcerer(22)<br/>\n39: Sorcerer(23): Automatic Still Spell II, Automatic Still Spell III<br/>\n40: Paladin(15): STR+1, (STR=26)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 294<br/>\nSkillpoints: 227<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 26/22/21<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8<br/>\nBAB: 26<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 35 (melee), 25 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 17/28<br/>\nSpell Casting: Sorcerer(9)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nConcentration 43(44), Discipline 43(51), Spellcraft 42(44), Taunt 24(29), Tumble 40(39), UMD 35(40)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Concentration(4), Spellcraft(4), Save(12),\u00a0<br/>\n02: Concentration(1), Taunt(5), Save(11),\u00a0<br/>\n03: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(2), Save(13),\u00a0<br/>\n04: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(16),\u00a0<br/>\n05: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(19),\u00a0<br/>\n06: Concentration(1), Taunt(4), Save(19),\u00a0<br/>\n07: Concentration(1), Taunt(1), Save(22),\u00a0<br/>\n08: Concentration(1), Taunt(1), Save(25),\u00a0<br/>\n09: Concentration(1), Taunt(1), Save(28),\u00a0<br/>\n10: Concentration(1), Taunt(1), Save(31),\u00a0<br/>\n11: Concentration(1), Taunt(1), Save(34),\u00a0<br/>\n12: Concentration(1), Taunt(1), Save(37),\u00a0<br/>\n13: Tumble(15), UMD(15), Save(18),\u00a0<br/>\n14: Concentration(2), Taunt(2), Save(19),\u00a0<br/>\n15: Concentration(1), Taunt(1), Save(22),\u00a0<br/>\n16: Concentration(1), Taunt(1), Save(25),\u00a0<br/>\n17: Concentration(1), Taunt(1), Save(28),\u00a0<br/>\n18: Concentration(1), Taunt(1), Save(31),\u00a0<br/>\n19: Concentration(1), Taunt(1), Save(34),\u00a0<br/>\n20: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(15), Save(23),\u00a0<br/>\n21: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(26),\u00a0<br/>\n22: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(29),\u00a0<br/>\n23: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(32),\u00a0<br/>\n24: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(35),\u00a0<br/>\n25: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(38),\u00a0<br/>\n26: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(41),\u00a0<br/>\n27: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(44),\u00a0<br/>\n28: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(47),\u00a0<br/>\n29: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(50),\u00a0<br/>\n30: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(53),\u00a0<br/>\n31: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(56),\u00a0<br/>\n32: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(59),\u00a0<br/>\n33: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(62),\u00a0<br/>\n34: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(65),\u00a0<br/>\n35: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(68),\u00a0<br/>\n36: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(71),\u00a0<br/>\n37: Tumble(25), UMD(20), Save(37),\u00a0<br/>\n38: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(2), Save(38),\u00a0<br/>\n39: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(41),\u00a0<br/>\n40: Concentration(1), Discipline(43), Taunt(2),\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[ Edited to fix my bad stats and add the exp penalty to the con's list]</div>"

Yes, she'd lose some skill points, but she wouldn't need UMD anyway<br/>\n<br/>\nTalking of AC and armour more generally, given that she's not taking Automatic Still Spells until in the 30s, does this mean she'll be casting in robes and then donning her full plate before charging in until that time?

If you wanted to, you could even go Dexer for combat instead of STR, make yourself much more difficult to hit, and probably keep close to the same AC with monk gear (shields are legal with monk gear too). If you ran into something you couldn't damage with a normal Dex weapon, well that's what spells and smite are for.\u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hey guys! Please allow me to pitch in and get a bit more technical.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do like Monk better than Rogue for this build, but the WIS AC is NOT a factor, because you'll be wearing armor. So that part of Monk is basically moot, as is the attack progression and Flurry of Blows. What Monk does do for you is give you Concentration AND Discipline as class skills, which means you can move the 15th Paladin level pre-epic and get the max off of your buffs. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou won't have such low AB as you think, as long as you use your Paladin spellbook correctly. You'll have a +5 Longsword from pally 15, and A couple of Divine Favors to give you that extra boost in boss fights. What I truly don't understand and really seems weird to me is the chosen leveling order. Why would you be in such a hurry to take your Sorcerer levels? I do understand 1 level on WoG for True Strikes and a certain Robe you get that can make your life easier, but to be honest, I would play this one as a straight-up meleer for the first 14 levels. The pally buffs do make up for the lower stats, as it is something that most pallies suffer from. Then, at level 12 (after your GMW and DF have reached +4 each), and you have 12 BAB in the first 12 levels, you can start getting your character to lag behind without that much problem. <br/>\n<br/>\nStag, the reason you don't value KD as much probably has to do with the difficulty you've gotten used to facing. If you ever do play on WoG, I'm 100% sure you'll change your mind. There's no need to disable non-threatening enemies, but if a regular mob high-level Wizard could cast Time Stop, Mordenkainen's Disjunction, Time Stop, Greater Sanctuary, then buff up and beat the crap out of you, or cast Time Stop and Bigby 9 plus a bunch of IGMSs at you, you would understand that if you let certain enemies cast the first spell, you're in for a world of pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is exactly what I meant when I said that you're shaped as a builder by the environments you face.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>",

Taunting in this build would be more useful in pre-epic. When your Pal buffs haven't kicked in yet. After that, it's questionable to say the least. You can even fathom spending points on Taunt to help in pre-epic, but in epics it  just won't make enough difference. So, perhaps a partial drop of Taunt is the best. Stop it at 20, if you must have it. Just so it gives you that extra boost in pre-epics, then just forget about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most important side effect of going straight up pally for the first 12 levels is the 3 attacks per round right away. That makes a HUGE difference! Especially when fighting in melee is your main method of killing things.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>",

I prefer going for it after Paladin 12. I know you play sneakily most of the time, but the way I see it, this is not a guy to play sneakily, this is a guy to play as a warrior with later casting prowess, because you need to build BAB for your later levels. Hasting a low AB 1-attack toon for 6 rounds is hardly going to be a game-changer. Hasting a 3-attack toon for 6 rounds buffed with Bless, Aid, GMW and Divine Favor will be AWESOME.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's just my 2 cents.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: I would NEVER drop Empower on a Sorcerer build, EVER. You could memorize some Invisibility Purges or get Dusts of Appearance to counter invis'ed people.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>",
