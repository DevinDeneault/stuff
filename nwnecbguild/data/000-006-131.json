There is a lot of investment to get Undead form from Druid 5/Shifter 10-11.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">The main difference between wildshape (Druid and Shifter) forms and polymorph (Polymorph Self and Shapechange) forms is item merging. Armor, helmet, and shield slots merge for all wildshape forms, while no items merge for any polymorph forms. In this particular case, other item slots (apart from bracers/gloves which don't merge for any wildshape forms) also merge for both Risen Lord and Vampire, while weapon properties merge for Risen Lord form.<br/>\n<br/>\nDespite a Vampire Wiz/Shif having some benefits such as extra immunities and elemental DR, I think a Wiz/PM would be a better option in general. Comparing Vampire and Iron Golem, the Vampire has +8 CON, elemental DR, +5 regen, and better item merging in comparison to the Iron Golem.<br/>\nA Risen Lord Wiz/Shif gets 50% Piercing DI and 50% Slashing DI in addition to undead immunities which helps differentiate it from a Wiz/PM or Iron Golem tank.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Yes, Yunim highlighted the main differences, and I think overall how a PM is more flexible vs a Shifter variant.\u00a0 While this concept is not completely original, it does illustrate the variety one can achieve with this game.\u00a0 One of the other perks for this Shifter variant is that you do have a few other forms that could be useful in certain situations, kobo commando being chief among them.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides the merging of item properties (this unto itself is its own thread to understand what merges, why it merges, and why other things don't merge), there is one more important distinction that makes a Shifter Undead shape superior to the Shapechange spell -- <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">a Shifter's shape cannot be dispelled</span>.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to merging, when you shift into, say, Vampire form any items with properties will merge with you and become part of your shape properties.\u00a0 This would include both Ring slots, Amulet slot, Boot Slot, Belt slot, Armor slot, Helmet slot, Shield slot (if any) and Cloak slot.\u00a0 Say you have a Ring of Major Fire Resistance and a Ring of Regeneration, and then say you have an Amulet of Acid Resistance, and then say you have a Greater Swordsman Belt, and a Cloak of Stamina +5, and Boots of Astounding Grip.\u00a0 When you shift, all of those wonderful properties merge onto your shifter form.\u00a0 It should be noted that ability bonuses will not stack and only the highest is applied when merging.\u00a0 The same is true for AC values.\u00a0 Only the highest AC value is retained.\u00a0 So there's no payoff for having a bunch of AC enhancing items; you only need the one with the highest value.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
