Wilting<br/>\n 9: Mordenkainen's Disjunction<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n NOTES<br/>\n<br/>\n - I played this character primarily as a Melee Mage, loading up the buffs and then casting Tenser's Transformation, Divine Might and Divine Shield.<br/>\n<br/>\n - You can also stack damage shields (Death Armor, Elemental Shield, Mestil's Acid Sheath) but you may want to forgo Divine Shield with this tactic, so you can actually get hit.<br/>\n<br/>\n - Four metamagic feats and access to all the Shadow spells allow for a lot of flexibility with your spellbook if you want to play spellslinger style.<br/>\n<br/>\n - Spell selection can be altered depending on your environment. The important things are to pick up buffs first and to alternate spell damage types each level.<br/>\n<br/>\n - Divine Shield gives a +6 bonus to AC for 6 rounds. With Empowered Eagle's Splendor and a bit of Charisma gear you can easily cap your CHA at 32, giving Divine Might/Shield a +12 bonus for 12 rounds.<br/>\n<br/>\n - I never wore armor but if you wanted to go that route you could swap out Silent Spell for Still Spell and maybe set DEX to 10 and CON to 14.<br/>\n<br/>\n - Healing Domain was chosen for the Empowered boost it provides to healing potions and Protection Domain power was the least useless ability for a level 1 Cleric, having a DC of 17 unbuffed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><span style=\"color:#000000\">edit: per Hip 20160627 (corrections/additions of missing info, in</span></em><span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong> red</strong></span><em><span style=\"color:#000000\">); moved final version to lead post</span></em><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Great ideas here though, especially War domain which I overlooked since the stat bonuses were tied to Cleric levels -- regardless, the attack and damage bonus and damage reduction would be useful. I also like your stat spread better. Shield (+4 Deflection) is superior to Shield of Faith (+2 Deflection) in this build.<br/>\n<br/>\nExpertise is indeed nerfed on my server, but if another module allows it then it could be worked in easily enough.\n</div></blockquote>\nGood point comparing the two \"shield\" spells.  At least it leaves some juggling room.  Divine Favor's magic damage can pierce DR.  One point mages sometimes forget is that Umber Hulk gets True Seeing at Level 4. earlier access to that spell buff than any caster except a cleric with animal domain.  I usually use an extended Umber Hulk for the majority of the venture saving Tenser's for the most demanding situations.  The only disadvantage is that the animation is kind of clunky but it's the best overall shape offered by that spell.  Hulk is extremely difficult to KD and cannot be disarmed as well.   \n<blockquote><div>\nWith a Sorcerer's high number of spells per day and limited spells known, I never saw the value in taking crafting feats. Brew Potion might be useful since you can use potions while polymorphed, allowing you to add Flame Weapon and Keen Edge to Tenser's Sword or apply Stone Bones to yourself while in zombie form. Alas, GMW potions only come in a caster level 5 variety.\n</div></blockquote>\nKeep in mind that you can craft some items with spells you may not even intend to retain on your final spell list.  It may make leveling a bit tougher with the XP expense, but you will have gained unique items that the designers have likely not considered when they built and balanced the environment.  I remember one server that allowed brewing of all cleric spells level 0 to 3 except Bless or Aid.  For some reason, the designer decided those two spells threw the balance out of whack (those potions were not vended either!).  Go figure.<br/>\n<br/>\nKail swears by Craft Wand on WoG.  You'll seldom see any of his caster-ish builds that have been biased toward that server that he omits wands.  Wizards have enough extra feats to allow some more diversity crafting-wise, but even a sorc can strengthen their arsenal and play the profiteer.  I've used all three feats and each has it's own advantages.  For your melee mage, I think you are correct.  Brewing potions that can be used while polymorphed is a natural adjunct.  Even Shadow Conjuration potions are possible though the spell list is limited.\n<blockquote><div>\nSome worlds (including the one where I mostly play) have modified Tenser's to not polymorph you. This is generally a more favorable version of the spell allowing you to utilize your gear and choice of weapon. The default version works fine as well but I would avoid gear with CHA or spell slot bonuses since after a few polymorphs you might find yourself missing some spells-per-day.\n</div></blockquote>\nThat's the first I've heard of a customization like that.  Never played a mage on Thain. Good stuff to know.\n<blockquote><div>\nI play on Thain (which is closer to mid-magic) and I mostly solo. It's not terribly challenging for the most part, but builds that sacrifice too much of either defense or offense can struggle when not in a party.</div></blockquote>\nThain is a decent testing ground for most builds.  It's been balanced well so your results should be likewise, fairly representative of a pre-epic server.  Tweaking for the server is a normal part of the build optimization procedure and really cannot be captured in a general build submission unless it was designed specifically for that server in which case the title should reflect that fact to make it easier for others to filter (the ECB really doesn't have any search or filter mechanism unless you count Google).<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have relatively few pre-epic builds.  Exceptional ones are rare mainly due to the lack of flexibility in applying dump classes (like pally in this one).  On some worlds, like Arelith, they have set prerequisites for toggling class selection that can be very prohibitive when building a pre-epic character.  Thain is not one of those, however.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Do you plan on killing things with spells or melee through shapeshifting/Tenser's? I don't see the benefit in not taking any spell focus feats with your high Charisma score, and instead taking Divine Might with such a low base BAB. IMO those two feats would be more effective if they were taken as SF / GSF something (Evocation or Necromancy, mostly). <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
