Given that we don't know who was using the build, or where, it would be hard to ask them - unless <em class=\"mention\">@eltalstro</em> can help us out, ofc. However, perhaps the Guild can pick up the gauntlet and come up with some possibilities? There are many possible combinations available: STR or DEX based? WIS and/or CON boosted? Unarmed or Karma (though I can't see how you could find room to D-W in a feat-starved build)? Monk or DwD as the primary class, or a pretty even split?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I'll be trying to cobble at least one something together, and it would be great to see others' interpretations. Shall we call it a challenge of honour to the Guild? We could keep contributions here or I could create a thread in the Build Request forum, if we get some interest.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks, eltalstro (and nice references while you were at it)!<br/>\n<br/>\nBlimey. So that's all 7 pre-epic feats taken care of. Mounted Combat, Dodge, Toughness, WF: Karma, TWF, Ambidexterity and ITWF. If it's a DEX and CON build, Finesse could take the place of ITWF, I suppose, but whichever it is, there's no room for Blind Fight or Improved Critical. I can't think they'd be taken in epic levels, given the 3 EDR feats would require a hefty investment already.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe'd be a tough one to build, I reckon, with plenty of min-maxing involved. And with a minimum DEX of 13, I'm struggling to see that CHA could be anything other than trashed (particularly given the dwarfishness), thus making Final Stand of very limited use - though that +5 magic damage helps re-balance that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll still see if I can come up with at least one decent version, but I herewith withdraw the challenge to the Guild. BSK is a an odd old place, it seems. Maybe <em class=\"mention\">@Yunim</em> is still dropping in here and can offer us some further insight...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for the info, <em class=\"mention\">@eltalstro</em>!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Based on the classes I'd guess it was a Monk9/PDK5/DD26, CON focused with either STR or DEX secondary. Personally I'd recommend dropping a class in order to get UMD or wand access but it would be ok for farming most areas. The main reason for PDK on BSK is the extra damage (1d6 unblockable Mag damage per level) rather than any of the PDK feats, so low CHA isn't an issue.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
