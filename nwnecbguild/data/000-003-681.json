      "content": "<div>I am completely in love with the Arelith Server cause of the roleplaying and crafting and I have the idea of roleplaying possibly human, half elf, or elf that Sings to \"nature\" meaning I know at least I will Have to take the classes bard and either druid or ranger. I am also aware that taking those classes together is not going to be at all strong for battle but I dont want it to... I want the build for the roleplay... I am going to completely be a support character... So only idea I have for this build is the races and possible classes and that I want to be able to effectively bard sing and speak to animals. I am not sure if I am posting this in the right area or not. if not please can someone direct me to the right place?</div>"
