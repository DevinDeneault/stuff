      "content": "<div>Hail, mighty ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\n Well, WoG is down again, so, in an effort to prevent boredom, I started working on my own first\u00a0STR-based Assassin build. Valerfor's most recent build got me thinking: if I were to do a STR-based Assassin, how would I do it? It's no secret that I prefer self-buffers; that's why I have many Bards / Wizards / Druids and especially Clerics in my NWN Builds folder, but that doesn't mean I don't appreciate the effectiveness of stealthers and sneak-types. However, I had never made a STR one. The first and most glaring weakness of such build types is LOW AC. So, unless you fight your enemies one at a time (which is not possible on many environments), you'll be in trouble. The second weakness that I see with this type of toon is dealing with True Seers. The third weakness is in the saves, but that can be mitigated with immunity gear, and the fourth weakness is dealing with sneak-immune types, but UMD scrolls and wands can help you there by adding Fire damage to your attacks, but that's worse for DEXers. In STR builds, you still have your STR damage to fall back on.<br/>\n<br/>\n In Val's build, a couple of things were not right according to my personal preference:<br/>\n<br/>\n 1- Wielding a two-hander weapon: Well, Assassins paralyze their OOC (Out of Combat)\u00a0opponents, so they need as many attacks as they can afford in their 1st flurry. Also, if you consider the bonus D6 of damage you get from Sneaks, you want as many attacks per round to apply them on as you can. A 2-hander, even though devastating for high-str toons, is not ideal for a STR-based Assassin IMO for those reasons. So I wanted a dual-wielder.<br/>\n 2- WM heavy investment for only 7 levels of it. This setup is only good against Dwarven Defenders, who are immune to Sneaks but not immune to Crits, so against DDs, it's a worthwhile investment. However, as was pointed out in Val's thread, many Sneak-immune monsters are also Crit-immune, so it doesn't add much to a build that's already excellent at doing damage to the\u00a0non-immune.<br/>\n 3- Once it's engaged in combat, the only way to resolve it is to kill everyone. I personally like to hunt down casters first, to prevent them from buffing, then deal with the remaining mobs. Val's build would destroy the caster, then need either an Invisibility Potion or a Dust of Disappearance to reposition and do it again. That's doable, but really expensive. I prefer HiPS. Even more so because of this type of character's characteristic low AC.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, I decided I would try a build with the following parameters:<br/>\n<br/>\n 1- Dual-wielding<br/>\n 2- At least 22 Assassin levels<br/>\n 3- At least 42 AB (40 Dual-wielding)<br/>\n 4- HiPS<br/>\n<br/>\n So I came up with this guy, and I'm really pleased with the results:<br/>\n<br/>\n Ranger(15), Assassin(23),

That's because Rangers get the 2nd attack per round AND the animal companion at level 6. It's worth delaying that Assassin level to 7.<br/>\n<br/>\n There are a few builds with this class combo, but only\u00a0two are\u00a0STR-based and they have much lower stats than this one. They end up at 36 and 38 AB dual-wielding against this guy's 41, but they both have a higher Death Attack DC. However, paralyzing enemies isn't as important for this guy as it'd be to a DEXer, because he can kill most things in one or two rounds, unless they are immune to his stuff. It's nice to paralyze things, definitely, but not vital. And if things get nasty, he can HiPS away and run.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build247732.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Moor Stalker</a> by dumediat is a dex-based EDer with a focus in Bows.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build117591.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Unnamed Build</a> by andymax is a DEXer with max DA DC.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build297288.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kalam Mekhar</a> by RangerSG is a STR-based with Longsword focus (why??? lol)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build279699.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Night Talon</a> by TyrTemplar is a DEX-based character with good AB and dagger focus<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build295415.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Deathshadow</a> by Mick Dagger is a dual-wielding MAX DEX elf with really good combat stats<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build226297.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Silent Assassin</a> by DarkCenturion is the other STR-based one with 38 final AB<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build229497.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shadow Stalker</a> by Talamier is another DEXer but with focus on both Melee and Ranged attacks<br/>\n<br/>\n The coolest thing here is that my build doesn't lose that much compared to DEXers, while having MUCH HIGHER stats than the STR-based ones. The sacrifice that I made for this was DA DC and HP. But, this guy wasn't built to tank, and his HiPS-oriented strat means he won't need to, so he can afford the extra offense. Before you get HiPS, the Assassin spell of Invisibility and Invisibility potions will do the trick for you, just make sure you have enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n He'll be kind of hard to play until level 22, but it's doable if you know how to use your gold properly, then he'll grow into a great offensive toon. He will come in stealth, kill one enemy, HiPS, come back, kill another one, HiPS, and do this as many times as he needs without receiving much damage until all enemies are either paralyzed or dead. Against Sneak-crit-immune, his Darkfire or Flame Weapon wands will get the job done. He'll suffer the most against True-Seers. True-seeing crit-immune monsters will be his doom. True-seeing casters will be a problem also, but\u00a0any\u00a0casters that can't see him coming will drop dead in less than a round, for sure! True-seeing devcritters with high Discipline can also be a pain in the butt, but there are ways to deal with them :D. He will need friends to deal with these kinds of enemies, for the most part anyway. He can set and disable all deadly traps except gas, but those only come much later in the build, so I would say those skill points can be used somewhere else, I just put them there cuz I like setting traps. It's fun!<br/>\n<br/>\n Summarizing: He has 11d6 DA damage dice, HiPS, IKD, Ranger dual-wield feats, full UMD and not such a heavy Armor Check penalty (he can only wear Light Armor for his Ranger dual-wielding feats to apply), so some DEX gear is in order. However, the coolest thing is that he has Camouflage, One with the Land, Cat's Grace and Mass Camouflage to increase his Hide and Move Silently scores to obscene totals of 75+! He is IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE by any non-true seer. All that while having a +11 unbuffed STR modifer to add to damage and 43 AB!<br/>\n<br/>\n I hope you like him!<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<br/>\n<br/>\n EDIT: I might as well suggest something that I saw as a possible tweak to take more advantage of your Evasion a little better. You can choose to exchange that last Assassin Bonus Feat for Epic Reflexes, which would increase your Reflex save and your chance to evade damage from traps and spells. But, I plan to give this guy a certain Padded Armor +5 that I already know where to get, so I'm going to try to cap his DEX, STR and INT with gear / buffs. He'll have Bull's Strength, Cat's Grace and Fox's Cunning Wands and Potions, as well as some very specific items that will allow him to have very close to capped scores on these 3 stats. But, since we're supposed to make generic builds here, this tweak could be interesting for some environments.</div>"

Dodge and Mobility are only there as requirements for SD. The nice thing for SD 2 is that it gives Evasion. You can also get 2 Rogue levels for another Sneak attack d6 and the same Evasion, but you'd lose the free Cleave from Monk 1. Your call. It's Cleave vs +1d6 SA.

      "content": "<div>Ah, sorry. Thanks, Hip. My supposed issues were that:<br/>\n<br/>\n 1. At level 11 there's a carry-over of 7 points (ranks), but if Discipline (5) is taken at that level - which it can be because it's a Ranger level - there would be a save of 2. Then, at level 12, one need only take Discipline (1) rather than 6 points in the skill, and you'd still have a carry-over of 4 points. Thus, I suspect it was merely a hiccup in the distribution. So, no harm, no foul. Mea culpa.<br/>\n<br/>\n 2. This concerned the 2 levels of SD. The solution was a simple misread on my behalf. I had mistakenly read UMD (3) as a Save (3), which would have meant a different number of skill points available to each level of SD. This, of course, is not the case.

But he caught up the next level so no biggie really.<br/>\n<br/>\n His allocation exactly matches the one I redid by following his table.<br/>\n<br/>\n He really allocated his trap/detection skills perfectly.\u00a0 (Must have read my guide *lol*).\u00a0 My only change would have been to take those 2 excess points of UMD [only need 34(33) for perfect scroll checks] and place them in Locks.\u00a0 It would have netted him 4 ranks plus whatever the ranger Cat buff endows, up to Locks 6.\u00a0 Would open locks up to DC 36 with +10 picks.\u00a0 That's not too bad if you can't find/buy Knock scrolls.\u00a0 Else, Animal Empathy which is often a buggy skill depending on where you play it.<br/>\n<br/>\n If something seems amiss, you should always ask the question.\u00a0 I've never had any pride to shoulder, so always got the information wanted regardless of how uninformed it made me appear. MY problem is retention.\u00a0 It's when I have to ask the same bleedin' question over and over that it becomes frustrating for both parties.\u00a0 Hence all the stickies lining the side of the monitor and cabinets.\u00a0 Even THAT doesn't always work either.\u00a0 Generally, guild members are very understanding, though, and forgive the dullness factor.\u00a0 But there are a few self-proclaimed elitists out there.\u00a0 Can you guess who tops that list? <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/10.gif\"/><br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

The guy I'll be playing is supposed to be as strong as a bear, with the constitution of an ox, while being repulsed by the new fad of socerous or divine assassins - so he relies on his well-trained skills with his long-knives (I'm reading kukris), stealth, ability to take damage, and brute power. Thus, I'm looking to drop my starting stats to WIS to 11 and STR 16, raising CON to 14.<br/>\n<br/>\n He's also not a trapsmith - but retains a singular focus on his targets, while not retreating from dealing with mobs if necessary. Thus, I'm also looking to drop the trapping skills (38 ranks taken) and redistribute into Concentration and Spellcraft (which will be cross-classed, I believe).<br/>\n<br/>\n Does this sound do-able without breaking the build, or would I be better served starting from scratch, do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks<br/>\n<br/>\n EDIT: Sorry, I realise this would have a catasrophic impact on an already crappy Will save - but we can't have everything, eh?</div>",
