      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">This is my first post on this forum, so - hello! I have been lurking for many years and learnt so much from all you guys. I don't play much anymore, but I am somewhere on the spectrum and the CBC sheet is probably the best game I have ever played!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, here is a build I have been tinkering with. I first got inspired by EasternPromise's funtastic <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/viewtopic.php?p=13777#p13777\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lawful Sexy, a Master Roshi tale: Monk 25 / Paladin 3 / Champion of Torm 10</a>, where he combines Monk with Paladin for Divine Might and Grace. That got me wanting to do my own unarmed Monk with Divine feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nI then saw Orion2019's post,\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/fallen-paladin-with-10-attacks-ie-paladin-12-monk--t2355076.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fallen Paladin with 10 attacks (ie Paladin 12 / Monk 2-6 / Blackguard 22-26) - concept only</a>, where he combines Paladin and Blackguard for fantastic saves together with a few levels of Monk. I could only find one build in the archives,\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build244612.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Blood Knight monk 9 / paladin 15 / blackguard 16</a>\u00a0by TyrTemplar. Both of these builds use Monk as a minor class and don't focus on fists so no good for what I am looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remembered Valerfor's <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-iron-fist-monk-35-ftr-5-t2349903.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">THE IRON FIST (MONK 35/ FTR 5)</a>, a build that goes for spectacular spell resistance and EWS. I think my build resembles this the most. I added Divine Might instead of EWS (can be buffed to potentially higher damage) and one more SR feat. Instead of CoT levels for the Wisdom dump as in Lawful Sexy, my toon gets AC from Divine Shield, and is arguably even better against spells due to 51(!) SR. Furthermore, the saves from CoT count towards the dodge cap, and the Divine Wratch AB towards AB cap. Without having done the math, I think both builds will have similar saves in high magic environments due to double saves bonus from Pal/BG.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, here is my first build!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Unholy Fist's Redemption -\u00a0Monk(35), Blackguard(4), Paladin(1), Human<br/>\n<br/>\nAlignment: Lawful Evil -&gt; Lawful Good.<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 16 (30)<br/>\nDEX: 10<br/>\nCON: 12<br/>\nWIS: 10<br/>\nINT: 10<br/>\nCHA: 16<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Monk(1): Lightning Reflexes, Power Attack, {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}<br/>\n02: Monk(2): {Deflect Arrows}<br/>\n03: Monk(3): Blind Fight<br/>\n04: Monk(4): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n05: Monk(5)<br/>\n06: Monk(6): Weapon Focus: Unarmed, {Knockdown, Improved Knockdown}<br/>\n07: Monk(7)<br/>\n08: Monk(8): STR+1, (STR=18)<br/>\n09: Monk(9): Toughness, {Improved Evasion}<br/>\n10: Blackguard(1)<br/>\n11: Blackguard(2): {Smite Good}<br/>\n12: Blackguard(3): STR+1, Divine Might, (STR=19)<br/>\n13: Monk(10)<br/>\n14: Monk(11)<br/>\n15: Blackguard(4): Divine Shield<br/>\n16: Monk(12): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n17: Monk(13)<br/>\n18: Monk(14): Improved Critical: Unarmed<br/>\n19: Monk(15)<br/>\n20: Monk(16): STR+1, (STR=21)<br/>\n21: Monk(17): Epic Weapon Focus: Unarmed<br/>\n22: Monk(18)<br/>\n23: Monk(19)<br/>\n24: Monk(20): STR+1, Epic Prowess, (STR=22)<br/>\n25: Monk(21)<br/>\n26: Monk(22)<br/>\n27: Monk(23): Great Strength I, (STR=23)<br/>\n28: Monk(24): STR+1, (STR=24)<br/>\n29: Monk(25): Improved Spell Resistance I<br/>\n30: Monk(26): Great Strength II, (STR=25)<br/>\n31: Monk(27)<br/>\n32: Monk(28): STR+1, (STR=26)<br/>\n33: Monk(29): Great Strength III, (STR=27)<br/>\n34: Monk(30): Improved Spell Resistance II<br/>\n35: Monk(31)<br/>\n36: Monk(32): STR+1, Great Strength IV, (STR=29)<br/>\n37: Monk(33)<br/>\n38: Monk(34)<br/>\n39: Monk(35): Armor Skin, Improved Spell Resistance III<br/>\n40: Paladin(1): STR+1, (STR=30), *Alignment Change*<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 410<br/>\nSkillpoints: 205<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 31/27/29<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Mind Effects: +2<br/>\nBAB: 26<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 40 (melee), 27 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 27/31<br/>\nSpell Casting:\u00a0<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 1<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscipline 43(53), Hide 5(5), Taunt 43(46), Tumble 40(40), remaining skillpoints 74<br/>\n<br/>\nRemaining skill points can be whatever you like.

The leveling order can be changed a bit to have Paladin first to access double saves boost sooner, but I think the Fallen Paladin trope is becoming a clich\u00e9 and personally I prefer the Hero's Redemption story arc much more and having the Paladin level very last makes the whole thing seem more believable. Also, taking Paladin at 15 and BG at 40 cost's two alignment changes (and probably your soul.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor different splits Pal 1/BG 3 will max SR, but then no maxed taunt and Sneak Attack. Pal 3/BG 2 gives DS and DM and a not good Smite Evil, no Sneak. Less Monk gives less SR, and I like the SR. Could also go uber cheese with a Spellcraft/UMD dump class.<br/>\n<br/>\nStarting charisma can be lowered to have slightly better unbuffed HP and Fort or Ref or Will or Skills, but that defeats the purpose of the Divine Feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease rip this guy apart!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You also want enough intelligence to get the skills you want, so charisma often becomes the ability to dump. <br/>\nSo the challenge with a build like this is to avoid that the abilities you want are stretched too thin.<br/>\nThe AB of your build looks good. The naked AC may seem a little low. It will help with both dex and wis gear/potions, and you get +9 to dodge AC from DS with a maxed out charisma. This kind of gear will also improve your already very good saves.<br/>\nThe SR is good, but not water proof (for that you need an SR of 67 or better). Yet it will annoy any unprepared mage. A pure level 40 mage without penetration feats will have to roll a 1d20 + 40 to try and beat the SR. He will succeed with a roll of 11 or better, meaning 50% of the time. But with most spells he also has to overcome your saves that are very good.<br/>\nIn the unlikely case that said level 40 mage also has epic spell penetration, the roll to beat SR is 1d20 + 46. Now he will succeed with a roll of 5 or better, meaning 80% of the time, but he still has to beat your saving throw with most of his spells.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Yeah, the Stunning Fist and QP DC's aren't great. CHA 14 and WIS 14 would make it better but then worse at the Divine Stuff and the saves that matter.\u00a0It would also add 1 more AC, 2 when not using DS. Would that be a good trade off?\u00a0The Spell Resistance: Thank you for the math... And I think you gotta stop somewhere while still able to hit something, ha!<br/>\n<br/>\n<em class=\"mention\">@Valerfor</em>\u00a0This might sound weird, but that means a lot to me. I look at your Whirlwind of Steel from time to time just to admire it - that build is a thing of beauty and probably my favorite from a building standpoint. I think many of your builds strike that balance between power, simplicity and playability which is what gave me the courage to post this simple thing.

Since charisma isn't a combat stat before level 11 and not really before level 12 and DM I decided to lower it to 15 and increase it at level 12. I also took 2 points from CON and voila, 14 WIS. I think the loss of HP is worth the +2 to AC, having better Stunning Fist DC and the better Will save before Monk 20 but does put him into Glass Cannon territory.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI changed the last bonus monk feat from SR to armor skin and used the last general feat to get STR 30, figuring 49 SR is still in the ballpark of 50/50 against pure casters without SP feats and very, very annoying against level 26's with those.

However, I think 6d6 sneaks are no joke on a guy with 7 APR, IKD and stunning fists with dc 32 and for stuff that is immune to that, DM is a much more viable option with base CHA 18. d20 fists at level 35 is also very sad, but what can ya do. No uncanny dodge is also not great.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
