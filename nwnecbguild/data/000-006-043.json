      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hello there, ECBers! This is the build to the character that inspired my nickname. Maximillian Kane is the most versatile character I've ever created. He is truly the apple of my eye. Back when I joined the ECB, he was a mere Wizard 20 Cleric 20 due to my lack of knowledge of NWN post-lvl 40 cap update. He then transformed into this beautiful anihilation machine that you now see before you thanks to the elder members of the ECB, who patiently endured my learning process and filled me with their immense knowledge. This is also a tribute to a retired friend of mine, Magical Master, from the old guild, who via e-mail discussed many things with me so that I could be able to reach this build. Turns out after all the exchange of ideas, we ended up with two different versions of the same build. Mine became a dual-wielder while his was a single-kama wielder, so if you want his build, trade TWF, ITWF and Ambidexterity for KD, Max Spell and Blind Fight.<br/>\n<br/>\n Sadly, it`s not an original build, as I later found out that there is one build in the old guild very close to this one, and even has the same name. But that one has a fatal flaw that was never corrected, since the builder forgot to put Weapon Finesse. I have no doubt, however, that he did get it, as all his stats count with it, so he probably just forgot to alter it.<br/>\n<br/>\n My build, IMO is slightly better than the one posted in the old guild, as that one already starts with Monk, having much earlier XP penalty, becoming unplayable till lvl 2 and spending all of its natural life without Tumble AC, whereas mine not only is more playable, since I go straight Cleric to the 14th level, only has XP penalty from the 17th level on (basically half its life) and +4 Tumble AC also from level 17 on. Other than that the only remaining difference is that the other guy went with a gnome, while I chose to go with elf for the RP part of it. I proudly present you: Maximillian Kane!<br/>\n<br/>\n Illusionist(23), Cleric(15), Monk(2), Elf<br/>\n<br/>\n Playable 1-40 PvM, Untested PvP<br/>\n<br/>\n Alignment - Any Lawful<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 8<br/>\n DEX: 18 (26)<br/>\n CON: 10<br/>\n WIS: 14 (18)<br/>\n INT: 16 (20)<br/>\n CHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n Elf: (Hardiness vs. Enchantments, Keen Sense, Low-light Vision, Skill Affinity: Listen, Skill Affinity: Search, Skill Affinity: Spot, Sleeplessness)<br/>\n 01: Cleric(1): Extend Spell, Domain War, Domain Strength<br/>\n 02: Cleric(2)<br/>\n 03: Cleric(3): Weapon Finesse<br/>\n 04: Cleric(4): WIS+1, (WIS=15)<br/>\n 05: Cleric(5)<br/>\n 06: Cleric(6): Empower Spell<br/>\n 07: Cleric(7)<br/>\n 08: Cleric(8): WIS+1, (WIS=16)<br/>\n 09: Cleric(9): Two-Weapon Fighting<br/>\n 10: Cleric(10)<br/>\n 11: Cleric(11)<br/>\n 12: Cleric(12): WIS+1, Ambidexterity, (WIS=17)<br/>\n 13: Cleric(13)<br/>\n 14: Cleric(14)<br/>\n 15: Illusionist(1): Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, {Scribe Scroll}<br/>\n 16: Cleric(15): WIS+1, (WIS=18)<br/>\n 17: Monk(1): {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}<br/>\n 18: Illusionist(2): Weapon Focus: Kama<br/>\n 19: Illusionist(3)<br/>\n 20: Illusionist(4): DEX+1, (DEX=19)<br/>\n 21: Illusionist(5): Epic Weapon Focus: Kama, Great Intelligence I, (INT=17)<br/>\n 22: Illusionist(6)<br/>\n 23: Illusionist(7)<br/>\n 24: Illusionist(8): DEX+1, Armor Skin, (DEX=20)<br/>\n 25: Illusionist(9)<br/>\n 26: Illusionist(10): Great Intelligence II, (INT=18)<br/>\n 27: Illusionist(11): Epic Prowess<br/>\n 28: Illusionist(12): DEX+1, (DEX=21)<br/>\n 29: Illusionist(13)<br/>\n 30: Illusionist(14): Improved Critical: Kama<br/>\n 31: Illusionist(15): Great Intelligence III, (INT=19)<br/>\n 32: Illusionist(16): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br/>\n 33: Illusionist(17): Great Dexterity I, (DEX=23)<br/>\n 34: Illusionist(18)<br/>\n 35: Illusionist(19)<br/>\n 36: Illusionist(20): DEX+1, Great Dexterity II, Great Intelligence IV, (DEX=25), (INT=20)<br/>\n 37: Illusionist(21)<br/>\n 38: Illusionist(22)<br/>\n 39: Illusionist(23): Epic Spell: Epic Warding, Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor<br/>\n 40: Monk(2): DEX+1, {Deflect Arrows}, (DEX=26)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 228<br/>\n Skillpoints: 237<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 22/29/26<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9, Mind Effects: +2<br/>\n BAB: 23<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 35 (melee), 32 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 32/32<br/>\n Spell Casting: Wizard(9),Cleric(8)<br/>\n Alignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\n Concentration 43(43), Heal 26(30), Listen 43(49), Lore 43(48), Spellcraft 42(47), Tumble 40(48)<br/>\n<br/>\n This guy has it all, although he does \"lag\" a bit. While you are still trying to get your Wizard levels up, monsters will get tougher, but the thing is that you are just SO MUCH STRONGER than anything you should lvl up against, that what happens is that the gap is reduced a bit till you start getting some nice spells to add to your combat strategy, like Improved Invisibility, the Bigby hands and IGMS. This toon will have 72 AC plus the capability of reducing the enemy's AB by 10 with Bigby's interposing hand. He will be able to penetrate maximum toolset SR by casting Mordenkainen's Disjunction followed by whatever damage spells he has. He has Time Stop and a high DEX modifier to pretty much assure that if he fights someone with Time Stop, his initiative will be superior and his will go off first.<br/>\n<br/>\n He can stand still and use Damage Shields + Epic Warding to let whatever monster kill itself or he can buff up and beat up anything. He can cast Time Stop, then True Strike and Harm for those servers where Harm hasn't been nerfed. He can use no save spells such as Word of Faith to blind opponents, and to top it all up, his familiar is a Pixie, just in case he needs to open some locks.<br/>\n<br/>\n He has VERY LOW HP and is vulnerable to dispel, but he has 7 Extended Divine Powers, 7 Extended Divine Favors and 9 Divine Favors to make sure that he can be dispelled but not crippled. Most of his AB comes from those 2 spells, as his BAB is 13, so +7 from DP and +5 from DF (with +5 from GMW AS A WIZARD SPELL as it is less likely to be dispelled, only 5% chance). He truly never stops growing, and it's BEAUTIFUL to play him cuz with him, there is no such thing as \"the next lvl won't give me anything\", you know? Like when you play a Fighter WM and then you get WM 13, then the next lvl you yearn for is WM 16 for another feat and +1 AB. Even if it is more spell slots, 2 new spells or a feat, there is always something you want on the next level to make you want to play him.<br/>\n<br/>\n He starts out as a rapier + board (large shield as your str is shyt) wearer, with the occasional longbow to lure enemies or hit n run. A chain shirt may be too heavy, so I prefer a Studded Leather armor. He uses summons a lot at first, as he's weak, but when you get to lvl 6 you may start buffing yourself up more and summoning less. You get Magic Vestment, Darkfire, GMW, Shield of Faith and Divine Favor improvements at lvl 6, so +2 AC and +2 AB plus the one you get for the regular BAB addition. You go on like this till you reach level 17. At that point you suffer a HUGE METAMORPHOSIS. You go from an armored and shielded rapier wielder to a dual-kama monk with evasion, cleave, 9 attacks per round and Wisdom AC (which is also when you start memorizing Empowered Owl's Wisdom). You drop all your heavy gear and walk around much lighter and with better carrying capacity. Divine Power grants you an extra attack from level 11 on, so you're already a beast even before that.<br/>\n<br/>\n Obviously, you use a lot of non-save spells, like Magic Missile, IGMS, Word of Faith, etc... and none with saves, as they're not your thing. There are 2 really bad things about using this build, besides being dispellable and having shitty HP, and those are: 1- total, complete and utter lack of shortcuts, which means that you will have to buff up from the radial menu, and buffing up would take a long time if it were done from the shortcuts, so imagine from the radial menu! You do get used to it, and in my case, I'm so used to this that my fingers are actually faster than the speed at which he buffs up, even when hasted. 2- Trouble finding suitable gear. This guy has basically 3 main attributes: Dex, for AB and AC, WIS for Clerical spells and AC, and INT for Wizard spells, so it can be a pain in the arse to equip him properly. When I get to that point in WoG, I will have to consider carefully what items to put on him. Thank god they have DM buys, but I still don`t know what I will ask for.<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyways, there are so many possibilities with a versatile build like this one that i'd have to write a book as thick as the bible to describe them. Alas, that'll be all for today. I hope you guys enjoy this toon as much as I do. I just simply LOVE this guy!!<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Generally, the discipline check will not guarantee much in a dex build with the max base being 43 -1 = 42 @ Lvl 40 (in this instance).  Check levels over 50 (at least) are necessary to avoid KD &amp; disarms reliably so strength builds can reach that and higher without much problem.  If this fellow has damage shields in place against a KDer, the prone situation won't be as devastating as with typical melee type classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Is this a question based on the way the server you play handles clerics?  In vanilla, there is no choice with domains... they are required at level 1.  Or are you questioning the specific domains chosen? If so, what are your own preferences? War &amp; Strength will give this toon extra slots of Divine Power along with the advantages of an extended Aura of Vitality. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I may be interpreting your question incorrectly so you may need to ask it another way.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  I am only guessing, but he probably wants to set Listen ranks as high as possible.  Only a monk dump @40 will assure that.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven a blind squirrel finds a nut from time to time.  Let's see how lucky this one was. <br/>\n<br/>\n@Max: BTW, you should rename this bloke \"Carpal Tunnel Master\" because if I used the radial that often I would need to procure some new medical insurance.  The prerequisite should be \"Wrists of Iron\" to play it. (Or 20 years younger!)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hey folks, Hip, you are far from being a blind squirrel, but you did get the nut perfectly, I will, however, add just a few things to each of the questions posted by D'alessandro there:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- Hip is absolutely correct. Discipline is a waste simply because you will have 72 AC in a +5 environment, and only 1d20 + 43 + 5 with a maxed out STR 20 (attainable via DP followed by Bull`s strength).  At best a check of 68 if you roll a 20 on it, still lower than AC, so a total, complete and utter waste of skill points, except in one situation. If the opponent rolls a 20, and has low AB, he hits, but you can resist the KD. However, a lot of his AC is Dodge and Dexterity AC and no Uncanny Dodge, so if caught flat footed, he is in trouble, that is why you should always walk around buffed with extended true seeing, preferably as a Wizard spell for smaller chance of being dispelled. Basically, after you rest, you buff up with all your hour/level buffs and extended turn/level buffs, then leave the round/level ones to cast when danger is afoot.<br/>\n<br/>\n2- The thing here is that War Domain gives ya Aura of Vitality, which is good, but also Cat's Grace, which is excellent, otherwise you will have to wait many many levels to be able to properly buff your Dex. On WoG I couldn't give him those domains because of Clerical restrictions, so he is STR and Protection. It's a little shittier, but you get Cat's anyway as a Wizard spell later on, just need to wait some more. AoV is sadly lost, and STR domain also gives Stoneskin, which is quite helpful in early leveling, as a lvl 5 spell . The beauty is that this build has many lvl 4 slots that could be used by regular divine powers, with the STR domain I can put Extended divine powers there instead, as it comes as a lvl 3 spell as well. The bread and butter of your melee combat are DP and DF and with this guy you get many many DFs and DPs, which is pretty efficient in countering any dispellers. If they dispel you, you just rebuff . I assure you that they will have less dispels than you have buffs <br/>\n<br/>\n3- What Hip said, because where I play, True Seeing adds to Listen and Spot to determine whether you can see a hidden creature, and pretty much every monster in the server hides.<br/>\n<br/>\nD'alessandro, I wrote a guide on the old guild which might help you catch up in terms of knowledge with the rest of the guild. I too didn't understand many of the choices the builders made because of the gap of knowledge between them and me. Now I have learned so much, at least on some classes, that I consider myself to be on the other side of the gap. Here is the link:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://social.bioware.com/group/2485/discussion/9490/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://social.bioware.com/group/2485/discussion/9490/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nU may need to join the group first . I will send the bic file as promised tonight before I go to bed <br/>\n<br/>\n@ Hip<br/>\n<br/>\nSome battles you spend 4 rounds buffing and then 1 killing the damned thing. But I have fun regardless. Slick fingers <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

At level 40, War Domain gives 3 Aura of Vitality casts a day with capped Wisdom, which is very handy in solving the shitty HP dilemma. About STR domain, I recently changed it up, it used to be healing so that cure minor woulnds would heal 6 HP and I'd have 2 lvls of Heal. In a toon with almost no HP, that can be great help. However, in WoG you roll 1d4 instead of getting the max everytime, so that went to the gutter. Also, the Strength domain gives Stoneskin as well as 2 levels of DP, which is EXCELLENT! That way you can have DR AND high AC for the first few levels, when leveling is hardest, although not hard at all. After level 17 you kinda cruise through stuff, even in WoG, which is the bane server to this build, with the gigantic quantity of dispel spammers. The occasional dirtnap does happen when you get dispelled or when you receive too much damage at once like a Smite Good critical hit (fricking Arbas!!!). You could be LN, I guess, but the LG alignment was for RP, as this is the main character of a book I'm writing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTechnically, I have 18 STR most of the time, given the great availability of Divine Powers. As of now I have 4 Divine Powers at lvl 3, 3 Extended DPs at level 4 and 5 at lvl 5. I'm currently at 27th level in WoG.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying on a laptop here, so no easy way for me, but my hands are so used to it and I do it so systematically that it's kinda like second nature at this point. I buff from the longest to shortest, starting with the ones that last 24 hours (endure elements, protection from elements), then the cleric ones as I now have 15 of cleric and 11 of wizard and then the wizard. I use hour per level buffs in their regular slots and all turn per level ones extended so that they last the same. These last two steps will change as the level of wizard surpasses the level of cleric, from lvl 31 on. One thing I forgot to mention though is that once you reach the Wizard 10 mark (therefore capping Flame Weapon), you'll average more damage per round with it than darkfire, so you use Darkfire on a couple of stacks of arrows to increase ranged damage output and flame weapon on melee.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I went for St. Cuthberts and you are right, it's Strength and DESTRUCTION, not protection, my bad. Basically it's Strength and another useless Domain. Point is I couldn't choose my 2 desired domains, so I had to pick between Strength and War. I chose Strength because WoG gear will allow me to cap dex, Int and Wisdom,and mayhaps even get my CON a couple of notches up, since EMA makes it so that I don't need any gear. So the two DP levels were more desirable to deal with the sick amount of dispel spammers you can find in that server.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the compliments, glad you like it. . Dual Wield is nice because you take full advantage of the Cleric damage buffs. If you do 5 damage a hit with DF, a one-handed build would do, hitting on all attacks, 35 damage a round (7 attacks per round). This one does 50 if it hits (10 APR). Now that's if you count only DF. If you count the extra damage granted by DP and Darkfire / Flame Weapon, you can imagine the sick dpr this build does. It can easily kill a 250 HP non-DR non-fire resistant monster in 1 round.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just read your build intro and saw you play in WoG, so if you have anything around lvl 27, call me up and I'll show you what this toon can do.

There is a partial justification for this, however, as you cannot cast lvl 8 spells until lvl 16, which is when your Wisdom score goes to 18. If you feel you're doing OK without the rogue skills, then take Cleric first, as it makes very little difference. I have to add, though, that where I play, bashing containers can cause the loot within to be lost, so Rogue skills are very important.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

This one was already a powerhouse, but it has become even better with the alterations. Nowadays, I prefer wielding a single weapon, so I got rid of the DW feats in favor of some much needed melee versatility. Expertise for AC malleability, Blind Fight for those concealed opponents, and KD to handle mages better (Bigby 6 also works, except against Drow Wizards cuz of SR, where KD works just fine and allows him to save up Time Stop uses). There could still be improvements in the skill selection, but this build is for a character in a book I wrote, so the skills and the Elf were for added flavor. You can achieve the same result with Dwarf or Gnome (6 STR becomes irrelevant with Divine Power) and tweak the skills as you please.

comment much, because I already did in the OP, but it should suffice to say that I've played probably 100 builds in many different environments, and this is the single strongest build I've ever played. It's on its own tier in terms of things it can do. The possibilities are truly endless.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can swap Expertise for Craft Wand if you wish. It makes things more comfortable, but IMO weakens the end result a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

They die in the 1st round with my 8 attacks. If not, I'll need to waste 2 Time Stops (or 1 self-crafted scroll of Time Stop for the first one, and a regular spell for the second). It's not an issue, really. But IIRC most of them aren't immune, right? I can't remember well, it's been a long time. <br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: One of the reasons this build is very advanced to play is that you need to keep perfect track of your flurries for maximum effectiveness. If you press a button 2 seconds earlier, it'll screw up your entire sequence. For example: If you want to cast a 2nd Time Stop in that specific situation, you need to press the quickslot ONLY when your character starts the 3rd flurry of attacks (his fully-buffed flurry schedule is 3/3/2). If you press it before, it's disastrous, because the 2 last attacks simply get canceled. If you press it too late, you get dispelled and allow the enemy to cast their own Time Stop. Every 3rd Time Stop, you can attack for 2 rounds, because it stops time for 1,5 rounds, and it does stack up. The enemies will basically flinch, and then get frozen again.<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Specifically for Invisibility, a Wand can save up a lot of quickslots, which is why I bought it from someone else. Don't even remember who, but thanks! And then I kept my amazing Expertise to reach 82 AC if needed LOL. 92 with Bigby 5. But yeah, absolutely, there are 2 feats that could replace Expertise: Craft Wand or Silent Spell. Both are reasonable choices, but IMO it's a matter of personal preference. I don't invest on Rogue skills cuz I have a Pixie, so I don't need them.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a lot of room for improvement in the skills if you want to rework them.

That's true, but I find that to be a good thing. It feels distant. I just wish (and I suggested as much in the WoG forums) that there were checkpoints so we can break the adventures into \"digestable\" bits.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis can be a pain for the first 20 levels, but it becomes less of a concern for epic characters. There are portal scrolls to many areas (Adventurer's Guild, Temple of Fharlangh, Borderkeep, Temple of Pelor in Urnst, etc,..). You do need to walk from those areas onward into the \"adventure lands\", but the portal scrolls significantly reduce the amount of walking one needs to do. Another thing that helps is Binding your soul to the closest temple to the place where you are planning to adventure in case of dirtnaps. If you forget and end up dead, then yeah, you gotta walk A LOT! LOL<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

This one was already a powerhouse, but it has become even better with the alterations. Nowadays, I prefer wielding a single weapon, so I got rid of the DW feats in favor of some much needed melee versatility. Expertise for AC malleability, Blind Fight for those concealed opponents, and KD to handle mages better (Bigby 6 also works, except against Drow Wizards cuz of SR, where KD works just fine and allows him to save up Time Stop uses). There could still be improvements in the skill selection, but this build is for a character in a book I wrote, so the skills and the Elf were for added flavor. You can achieve the same result with Dwarf or Gnome (6 STR becomes irrelevant with Divine Power) and tweak the skills as you please. In the book, he was a know-it-all kind of guy, so Lore 43 represents that.

That allows you to craft scrolls of spells you will need so you don't run out. Also, your Wisdom only reaches 18 at level 16, so you won't have access to level 8 spells before that anyway, although by going Cleric from 1-15 your buffs would cap one level earlier. TBH I prefer to have the option to scribe scrolls and have unlimited spells at my disposal, than to get the buff increases a level earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Monk level is where it is because the latest it can be taken is 18th level, since your last level to take Weapon Focus is 18th (last pre-epic bonus feat), so you can't delay it to 20, but you can delay it to 18th level. However, the question then becomes: WHY? I say that because your Tumble AC increase happens at 17, and Wizard 2 doesn't really add a new spell level or anything, so delaying that Monk level wouldn't accomplish anything. That's why I took it at 17th. If I were you, I'd keep it that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You can get an abnormally high AC (82 with Expertise and EMA), if you need it, but you can also Damage shields / EW, and because you lack Uncanny Dodge, when you stand flat-footed, most of your AC disappears, which is beneficial if you can control when that happens. So, for me, both EW and EMA are part of the core of the build, and as Kfor has explained, you'd need to give up one of them for the Monk speed. Also, Monk speed grows in increments every 3 levels, and I find that it starts to make a reasonable difference with 9 levels of Monk; before that the difference is kind of negligible in my experience. There is the \"speed stacking\" exploit you'd be able to do with 3 Monk levels, which I don't even know if EE fixed, but TBH I prefer having the 2 epic spells.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if you think you can get the AC bonus from EMA from other sources, the freedom it gives you in terms of item slots is amazing, and for this toon, it's kind of necessary because you need to cap 3 stats: DEX , WIS and INT.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that's what I have to say.

You wouldn't be able to use Wounding Whispers even from scrolls, as this build doesn't have UMD and that's a Bard spell. However, in my experience, this build has enough AC to stand toe to toe with pretty much any endgame boss on WoG, but there are places I haven't explored with it on EE, and I know have gotten harder than they used to be. Still, 77 AC (82 with Expertise) is nothing to sneeze at, and neither is 61 AB. However, because you went Animal and Plant, you don't have access to Divine Power as a level 3 spells, so you'll probably run out of DPs faster than my iteration of the build, which means your adventuring days will be shorter. In most areas that won't be a problem, but I know of a certain extraplanar place where Leo's scrolls don't work and you may end up in trouble because of it (provided you don't bypass battles by GSing through most enemies).<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, the way I thought it out and designed it, the entire idea of this build is to have options for all situations. Fighting a spellcaster? You have something to deal with that. Need high AC? You have ways of skyrocketing your AC. Albeit dispellable ways until level 39. Need DR? You have EW endless Premonition scrolls. If damage shields are less effective, then there may be some instances where EW would lose value, but you could combine EW with EMA if you are getting hit and turning on Expertise would heavily impact your chances to hit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the battle against the WDK minions, that PM one that has an insurmountable AC, but also doesn't hit except on 20s with 3 attacks per round, you have 8 attacks per round with Flurry of Blows and could potentially equip an off-hand Kama for a 9th attack, just to increase your chances of rolling a 20. It's all about the options.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, a build is just a general guideline that you can and should tweak to taste, although admittedly the improved summons would be way better for Aerie's class split and concept than for this one.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'd recommend the following tweaks to your playstyle in order to get past these early epic levels when your Wizard spells haven't kicked in and your Cleric buffs have already been capped for quite a while, but are extremely dispellable:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Buy Premonition Scrolls to have good DR when getting hit.<br/>\n- Buy Shadow Shield scrolls to save up 2nd level slots for Extended Divine Favor.<br/>\n- Use your Wizard spell slots for multiple iterations of Invisibility and Improved Invisibility to reposition yourself. Possibly even have a scroll-crafting session and make many invis and improved invis scrolls so you can survive getting dispelled. If so, you can memorize Darkness and Extended Darkness for tactical use with your 2nd and 3rd level slots.<br/>\n- Get the Staff of Elemental Summoning and a Magic Electrifier at the AG to get a random level 10 summon.<br/>\n- Buy Greater Sanctuary scrolls (I don't remember where but I know you can buy them). Try to recast it before going into areas where you know Dispels abound, then summon a creature and buff it with an Improved Invis scroll to bait all dispels with no chance of failure.<br/>\n- Buy Bigby 5 scrolls at the AG to make sure you have an AB-reduction tool for tough fights against some nasty foes that hit hard. It's basically +10 AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are just a few things I used to get past these \"laggy\" levels. You should almost always, if not always, be invisible using this build except when fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The versatility offered by this build is unmatched by any other build I've played. It has so many options of ways to deal with things, that indeed there can never be enough quickslots. It excels in low magic environments, where items don't make such a huge difference and immunities aren't everywhere.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, as Webshaman pointed out below your post, it does have some weaknesses too, and in environments that attack these specific weaknesses, it may struggle to level up. The main downsides of leveling this guy are dispels and Spell Resistance. Mind you, with a 61 fully buffed AB, you'll always have meleeing to fall back on when everything else fails, but having to consistently rebuff is a PITA.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
