There are two main reasons i use kukri instead of long sword<br/>\n<br/>\nfirst of all, long sword is a medium weapon, meaning that if you wield two longswords you will have -4 penalty on ab<br/>\non the other hand, kukri is a tiny weapon so ab penalty from dual wielding decreases to 2<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, long sword has a threat range of 20, which means that it will make critical hits percentage to 5%<br/>\neven with keen, ki critical, and improved critical,\u00a0 \u00a0threat range of long sword is 16-20 so critical percentage is 25% at maximum<br/>\nif you take kukri its base threat range is 18-20, so it will have critical percentage of 15%<br/>\nwith improved critical, ki critical, and keen kukri's threat range is 10-20, so it will have critical percentage of 55%, which is very high compared to that of long sword's<br/>\n<br/>\n* about the +16strength, as long as i know the base ability cap is 12, so even if you have +16\u00a0 str sword your str will only go up 12\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, english is not first language for me either ;)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If you want a challenge, then you'll want to play an advanced module or in a persistent world. I highly recommend Swordflight if you're looking for a single-player challenge. World of Greyhawk is an excellent persistent world if you'd like a more dynamic challenge (though in many ways, Swordflight can actually be more challenging since xp and resources are limited in a single-player module and there are some enemies you simply have to fight - you can't just go find a different area to get xp if an area is too difficult for you).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you adjust your in-game ability caps to go beyond 12, the game will feel even easier. I highly recommend against it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you do try out Swordflight and if you're able to get through it on Hardcore difficulty, start over on Very Difficult for an extra challenge :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBest,<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.
