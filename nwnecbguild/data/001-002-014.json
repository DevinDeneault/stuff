Since you stopped by to comment on this thread, I'm here to let you know that WoG has undergone a facelift! Many new areas, old quests have been revamped, areas added and / or changed! Wise has been busy! And there are many new players logging on. Maybe it's time for you to dust off some of your old builds and take them for a spin? All old characters are gone, which on the downside means you'll lose all the toons you had on Raine's computer. On the flipside, you can replay them all! I'm replaying all my favorite characters: Maximillian Kane, Aegis Silverwolfe, Melvin Manhoef, Natalya Salomon, Nathyrra, and a bunch of new toons, from BG (Aerie, Jan Jansen, Imoen, Cernd) and from my ECB tomes (Subtle Death, Draconic Arcanist, Underdark Expeditioner, Drow Fencer, Guard Captain (not posted, but basically a Fighter 12 / WM 25 / Rogue 3), Demolition Man). It'd be great to have you back!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>",

And I know, that in the age that some of us are, \"change\" is hard and everything must be considered it carefully before even attempted, but playing in a good PW with\u00a0other people is second to none. No amount of Aielund or any other top-of-the-line module can rival that. The whole thing is as close to a true Dungeons &amp; Dragons experience you can have apart from rolling the dice physically in the company of a great DM.
