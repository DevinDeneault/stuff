I've played a couple builds where I take only 1 or 2 levels of cleric or druid JUST to have access to enhanced summons, specifically the elemental royalty. Though some people seem to indicate that they lose their effectiveness eventually...but when I buff mine, they've been helpful even fighting drow...and when I SEE an elemental royalty on the enemy side, I take careful consideration.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">On WoG, the animal domain gains summons one level higher than standard. This is normal activity for NWN, just that WoG made something beyond the dead end. That is, a ninth level spell gives a more powerful summon, the aforementioned Elemental Royalty as I call them.<br/>\nThe boosted summons occur from any summon monster spell that the character casts, be it from scroll,staff, or device. It does not work on the Elemental Swarm spell. Thus someone with the animal domain, whether it is from a druid level or cleric with the proper deity, can get the elemental royalty by using say, a summon monster IX scroll.<br/>\nNow, using this \"trick\" does have a downside, beyond the use of the third class for such things. It cannot choose what the summon will be using the Book of Summons available on WoG. Let me explain. A druid with many druid levels would be able to use the book of summons and pick what summon they get at every level, and change it at will. They can also choose what they get when they cast Summon Monster IX...Do they want the Elemental Prince of Earth to be summoned at the casting of the spell, until they change it? So be it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my trick, I'd have the enhanced summons, but would only have the ability to choose the result for the corresponding spell that I'd actually HAVE in my spell book, and the Elemental Royalty would be randomly determined when I cast the Summon Monster IX spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that this enhanced behavior is similar to what one gets with the Healing domain, that is every Cure spell cast by the character is boosted to 150% effectiveness, whether it be from a potion/scroll/etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSort of confusing with the summons, and not something I do all the time, but when I am in my caster phase, I do love to do a \"Merlin\" blend, that is with a lot of wiz levels, 1 or 2 druid, and rogue for dumps.\u00a0 When Dominate Monster was working more effectively on WoG, it was a true test of my micromanaging abilities to be controlling a familiar, summoned monster, and a Dominated enemy.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
