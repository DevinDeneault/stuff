      "content": "<div>Hello All,<br/>\n<br/>\nThis one is very much in the development stage. I'm trying to construct a mundane party tank who's a little, shall we say, on the volatile side. I've given him both Terrifying and Mighty Rage, as well as EDRIII and a deep HP pool to help with his less than spectacular AC (which you'd think is a big no-no for a tank). All of this comes at a price, however, so he ain't the strongest in the world. Raging helps, obviously, but I'd welcome your thoughts - including, but hopefully not limited to, \"it's a stupid idea, stop it now\".<br/>\n<br/>\nApologies/ excuses out of the way, do please have a look where I'm currently at...<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I haven't factored in the dwarfly stuff yet, sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Raging Tank</strong><br/>\nBarbarian 28/ Fighter 4/ CoT 8<br/>\nAny non-Lawful, non-Evil<br/>\nPvM 1-40<br/>\nDwarf ('cause they're lovely, and they get +4 dodge AC vs Giants, +1 AB vs orcs and goblinoids, +2 lore and search underground, darkvision, and +2 to saves vs poison and spells.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Stats</strong><br/>\nSTR 16 (24)<br/>\nDEX 12<br/>\nCON 18 (22)<br/>\nWIS 8<br/>\nINT 14<br/>\nCHA 6<br/>\n<br/>\nHPs - 696<br/>\nSaves - Fort 35, Will 20, Reflex 22 (all +6 vs spells, +2 vs poison)<br/>\nAC - (naked) 17, (full plate) 25, (w/tower shield) 28. +5 w/Expertise<br/>\nSkills - 234: Discipline 43 (50), Intimidate 43 (54), Listen 29 (28), Spellcraft (cc) 18 (20), Taunt 43 (54), Tumble (cc) 20 (21)<br/>\nDR - 15/-<br/>\nTerrifying Rage DC - 54 + 1d10<br/>\nGreater Rage duration - 15 rounds (x8 p/day)<br/>\nMighty Rage duration - 17 rounds (x3 p/day)<br/>\nBAB - 30<br/>\nAB - (max) 41/ 36/ 31/ 26<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Levelling</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n1 B1 - Luck of Heroes/ {Rage 1/ Barb speed}<br/>\n2 F1 - Weapon Focus (Battleaxe or Warhammer)<br/>\n3 B2 - Expertise/ {Uncanny Dodge I}<br/>\n4 F2 - Knockdown/ STR+1 (17)<br/>\n5 F3<br/>\n6 F4 - Weapon Specialization (Battleaxe or Warhammer)/ Blind Fight<br/>\n7 B3<br/>\n8 B4 - STR+1 (18)/ {Rage 2}<br/>\n9 B5 - Improved Critical (Battleaxe or Warhammer)<br/>\n10 B6<br/>\n11 B7<br/>\n12 B8 - Improved Knockdown/ CON+1 (19)/ {Rage 3}<br/>\n13 B9<br/>\n14 B10<br/>\n15 B11 - Skill Focus: Intimidate<br/>\n16 B12 - CON+1 (20)<br/>\n17 B13<br/>\n18 B14 - Skill Focus: Taunt<br/>\n19 B15 - {Greater Rage 4}<br/>\n20 B16 - CON+1 (21)/ {Greater Rage 5}<br/>\n21 CoT1 - Epic Damage Resistance I<br/>\n22 CoT2 - Epic Damage Resistance II<br/>\n23 CoT3<br/>\n24 B17 -\u00a0 Epic Damage Resistance III/ CON+1 (22)<br/>\n25 B18<br/>\n26 CoT4 - Epic Weapon Focus (Battleaxe or Warhammer)<br/>\n27 B19 - Terrifying Rage<br/>\n28 CoT5 - STR+1 (19)<br/>\n29 CoT6 - Epic Weapon Specialization (Battleaxe or Warhammer)<br/>\n30 B20 - Great Strength I (20)/ {Greater Rage 6}<br/>\n31 B21<br/>\n32 B22 - STR+1 (21)<br/>\n33 B23 - Great Strength II (22)<br/>\n34 B24 - Mighty Rage/ {Greater Rage 7}<br/>\n35 CoT7<br/>\n36 CoT8 - Epic Skill Focus: Intimidate/ Armour Skin/ STR+1 (23)<br/>\n37 B25<br/>\n38 B26<br/>\n39 B27 - Epic Skill Focus: Taunt<br/>\n40 B28 - Epic Prowess/ STR+1 (24)/ {Greater Rage 8}<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you like, you can swap out LoH (for -1 to all saves) for Exotic Weapons Prof and grab some Dwarven Waraxe - it really rather depends on whether they're readily available where you play. I could bang on about the pointy-eared devils getting swords and bows for free while our bearded heroes don't even get proficiency in their own special weapon, but I won't. Yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT</em></strong>: Miscalculated DR - I'd only given 2 to each EDR feat rather than 3, so it's 15/-, not 12/-. Have changed it. I've also taken Orion's suggestion about the starting stats on board and adjusted the skill-set accordingly. Now I've just got to factor in the dwarf stuff and take the EDR feats earlier, which I'll do soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT 2</em></strong>: Done the other stuff now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT 3</strong></em>: And some more, thanks to Orion's additional suggestions. I've also swapped the feats I take the Skill Foci and their epic equivalents around. And I had another thought as well - taking Mighty Rage at Barb 24 (L34) and dropping Epic Prowess down to level 40 as the Barb bonus feat there, while shuffling CoT 8 up to level 36 and taking AS as the bonus feat there. And I must confess I'm now tempted to drop down to 26 levels of Barb and lift it to 10 of CoT. No loss of bonus feat, and +1 to all saves, at the expense of 4 hit points. Hmm.</div>",

Would it be better to go Dex 12 Int 14 or am I missing something. Or because you take fighter at lvl 2, with heavy armor proficency even set Dex to 8 and Int to 16 for heaps of skill points. Or put Cha to 10 and consider swapping the pre epic skill foci feats for toughness and iron will<br/>\n<br/>\nWith EDR III it's a powerful ability and I would take those feats much earlier early epic. I noted you take Str 19 at level 12, you could change this to Cons +1 allowing you to take EDR I, II and II at levels 21, 22 and 24.</div>"

      "content": "<div>All good suggestions, Orion, thank you! This is exactly why I brought it here now - to counteract my natural inclinations. As for the Dex/ Int thing, that's just me being a nidiot. I knew I needed 13 Int for IKD so simply set it in stone and didn't even look at adjusting it. A 12 Dex/ 14 Int is a much better idea. Those extra 43 skill points will be very useful. I've never liked dropping Dex to 8 (or even 10) because even full plate allows for +1 Dex to AC, and AC is pretty sparse here so I want every drop I can squeeze out of it. I know it isn't min/maxing optimally, but still...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as EDR goes, you're right as well. I think I just got twitchy about my AB and damage output. I'll see what I can do. (I'd have loved to take Barb and DwD, but rules is rules I suppose, damn it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as for Raging in its many forms, (and apparently it's particularly effective on WoG, btw), Greater Rage (Barb15) gives +6 to Str and Con, +3 to Will saves, and -2 to AC, and lasts for Con modifier +9 rounds. Its Terrifying variety lasts 1xd3 rounds and has a DC of Intimidate +1xd10, as well as paralyzing its targets, so all but your sternest pally should be cacking his pants. Mighty Rage is only useable 3 times a day (you can use Mighty and then Greater, but not the other way around), has no AC penalty, lasts for your Con modifier +11 rounds, and grants +8 to both Str and Con, and +4 to Will saves. You do need 21 Str and 21 Con before you can take it, however. I'd love to take it earlier than 40, but I'm doing a weird balancing act, so...<br/>\n<br/>\nI will incorporate your suggestions in an edit, should anyone else contribute. Cheers!</div>",

      "content": "<div>Quite right, Web. The first thing that irked me with Barbs was hunting victims of Rage down after they've run away - potentially not just time-consuming, but very dangerous to boot. But now, in most arenas (WoG clearly being an exception), Rage freezes foes to the spot, which is much handier.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I believe we discussed increasing the number of Rages in my\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/terrifying-bane-ranger-22-barbarian-16-sd-2-t2355227.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Terrifying Bane</a> thread recently. So we're on the same song-sheet there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the benefits to Strength, here we've got 8x15 rounds (120) per day of Greater Rage (+6 Str) and 3x17 rounds (51) of Mighty Rage (+8 Str). That's not so bad, is it?<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbarian just seems to be an under-utilized class, so I simply wanted to take it out and show it the sights, give it an ice cream, take in a show and so on. And while tanking with one might seem a little perverse, I think we can get it working. I'm more than happy to learn from those who've been around the block once or twice, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the insight!</div>",

I had only thought about taking both Terrifying and Mighty Rages as Barb bonus feats (Barb level 24 and 28), but given that in the re-jigged version I ended up taking AS as a general feat, swapping that for Terry Rage makes sense.
