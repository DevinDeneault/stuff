I will take advantage of this very little free time I have right now to repost a build that I enjoyed making back in the old guild, to which many of the elders made a great contribution. It's a high-AB and AC, trap-setting, max-stealth sneaker with a Panther familiar (for more sneaks and style points), HiPS, Epic Dodge, Bane of Enemies and Crippling Strike as the icing to the cake.<br/>\n<br/>\n Ranger(23), Rogue(16), Shadowdancer(1), Halfling<br/>\n<br/>\n Alignment: Any<br/>\n<br/>\n Playability: 1-40 PVM (VERY HARD from 1-6, but doable with loads of running around and shooting stuff in the head or in party)<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 10<br/>\n DEX: 18 (30)<br/>\n CON: 12<br/>\n WIS: 14<br/>\n INT: 14<br/>\n CHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n Halfling: (Fearless, Good Aim, Lucky, Skill Affinity: Listen, Skill Affinity: Move Silently, Small Stature)<br/>\n 01: Ranger(1): Weapon Finesse, Favored Enemy: Undeads, {Dual Wield}<br/>\n 02: Ranger(2)<br/>\n 03: Ranger(3): Expertise<br/>\n 04: Ranger(4): DEX+1, (DEX=19)<br/>\n 05: Ranger(5): Favored Enemy: Elementals<br/>\n 06: Ranger(6): Knockdown<br/>\n 07: Ranger(7)<br/>\n 08: Ranger(8): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br/>\n 09: Ranger(9): Improved Critical: Short Sword, {Improved Two-Weapon Fighting}<br/>\n 10: Ranger(10): Favored Enemy: Constructs<br/>\n 11: Ranger(11)<br/>\n 12: Ranger(12): DEX+1, Weapon Focus: Short Sword, (DEX=21)<br/>\n 13: Ranger(13)<br/>\n 14: Ranger(14)<br/>\n 15: Ranger(15): Dodge, Favored Enemy: Dragons<br/>\n 16: Ranger(16): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br/>\n 17: Ranger(17)<br/>\n 18: Ranger(18): Mobility<br/>\n 19: Ranger(19)<br/>\n 20: Ranger(20): DEX+1, Favored Enemy: Outsiders, (DEX=23)<br/>\n 21: Ranger(21): Bane of Enemies<br/>\n 22: Rogue(1)<br/>\n 23: Shadowdancer(1): {Hide in Plain Sight}<br/>\n 24: Rogue(2): DEX+1, Epic Weapon Focus: Short Sword, {Evasion}, (DEX=24)<br/>\n 25: Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br/>\n 26: Rogue(4)<br/>\n 27: Rogue(5): Improved Knockdown<br/>\n 28: Rogue(6): DEX+1, (DEX=25)<br/>\n 29: Rogue(7)<br/>\n 30: Rogue(8): Armor Skin<br/>\n 31: Rogue(9)<br/>\n 32: Rogue(10): DEX+1, Improved Evasion, (DEX=26)<br/>\n 33: Rogue(11): Great Dexterity I, (DEX=27)<br/>\n 34: Rogue(12)<br/>\n 35: Rogue(13): Defensive Roll<br/>\n 36: Rogue(14): DEX+1, Epic Dodge, (DEX=28)<br/>\n 37: Rogue(15)<br/>\n 38: Rogue(16): Crippling Strike<br/>\n 39: Ranger(22): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=29)<br/>\n 40: Ranger(23): DEX+1, Epic Prowess, (DEX=30)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 374<br/>\n Skillpoints: 324<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 24/19/27<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses: Traps: +3, Fear: +2<br/>\n BAB: 30<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 45 (melee), 43 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 31/33<br/>\n Spell Casting: Ranger(4)<br/>\n Alignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\n Disable Trap 41(45), Heal 7(9), Hide 43(53), Listen 43(47), Move Silently 43(55), Open Lock 41(51), Set Trap 25(37), Tumble 40(50), UMD 41(40).<br/>\n<br/>\n You could use some of the skillpoints from Open Locks and Heal to Craft Traps if you prefer, which is good unless you can buy lots of traps, because you don't get Disable Traps till after lvl 22. Also I recommend letting your Panther do the damage, because you don't have Sneaks yet. That`s why I took Expertise at lvl 3. You can even take it at lvl 1, because from 1-3 you shouldn't be meleeing at all, so finesse is kind of pointless. From lvl 6 on, when you get your Panther, use a Large Shield and turn on Expertise to tank while your Panther does the damage. Your damage output is nothing short of pathetic for the first 20 levels, such is the investment on AB and BoE. You can drop 1 BAB and go Ranger 16 Rogue 4 pre-epic for more playability, but that's just not my style of building. I build to endure a HARD leveling period and be more powerful at lvl 40. I have ALWAYS so far, been able to play my early-gimped builds to the point when they mature and become serious beasts. This one will take a big leap in power at 21, 22 and 23 and another at lvl 36, from then on it's just a MONSTER.<br/>\n<br/>\n Setting traps will help out A LOT in the earlier stages, and afterwards you can make a huge minefield of any traps you find except epic ones. Even Deadly Gas Traps can be used by this toon. I take 25 ranks in Set Traps because I only get Disable Traps at lvl 22, but there are not enough skill points to max it out (I prioritized Stealth, UMD and Tumble). So that Synergy bonus will come a little later (lvl 24), and I did have the skill points to waste. You can also invest on Search, but I prefer to use Find Traps scrolls or have a spare Watchman's Helm on the side, which should be enough to find most traps.<br/>\n<br/>\n One more thing that needs to be mentioned is that the FEs are chosen because they either are more likely to have DR or to be immune to criticals. They are strategical choices to make this build work against those who are immune to his sneaks. Dragons in particular can be a pain in the butt, because even with BoE, they may have more DR than you can chew. Oh, well, you can't have it all!<br/>\n<br/>\n All in all it's a fun character to play, except for the 1-6 period, cuz of all the running around and sniping you need to do, and it has a lot of versatility to be a very solid sneaker that can hold his own in most situations. I hope you like it<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I would drop both Dodge &amp; Mobility to replace with Exotic prof &amp; Blind Fight, retaining IKD to use against mages &amp; fire giants/trolls.  The Tumble skill is plenty high enough to avoid MOST in-combat AoOs (including using armor/shield config) unless you opt to play reckless berzerker style, a tactic I seldom encourage for what should be obvious reasons.  Point is:  The PLAYER can control the benefit of Mobility by style of play in at least 90% of situations. The Dodge feat AC will be recouped from halfling racial AC.  Also, that Appraisal level would need to be a server-specific choice because most always I have found that any Appraise level over 20 has severely diminishing returns.  Many servers don't even implement an Appraise check. <br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I played a similar kukri ranger/rogue (can't remember the tertiary anymore) build like this myself on a HiPS-nerfed server a few years back with great success.  Personally, I have never found any weapon as effective as kukris for DWing.  Also, Max knows how much I love to control the game with traps and this sort of build made it easy-peasy for mob control.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Well, regarding the given advice, the only thing that for me is droppable on the halfling version is Expertise to take Blind Fight, and then I'd have to be content dualing daggers. Still, I wouldn't say that my main reason for dropping the Halfling race was the lack of BF or exotic weapons. I was playing this build and trying to KD mobs that were supposed to easily go down and they were resisting my attempts 50% of the time. That was what did it for me, I would rather lose 2 AB points and be more effective KDing (and therefore giving me a chance to land sneaks) than keep the AB and be constantly failing to sneak my foes. You can, for instance, use Darkness and generate sneaks, but since you're not a Dwarven Defender or PM, you will also get sneaked by the mobs. And in WoG that's never good, because even regular high lvl mobs have Epic Dodge, Crippling Strike and do a hell of a lot of damage if they manage to hit you with Sneak attacks. HiPS in and out is also an option, but it takes much longer, and in the case of mages, you can KD and kill them before they get their buffs up.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the rest, it's viable tweaks. I personally find that where I play, 15 Search is more than enough, because there is a helm that gives you +8 to Spot, Search and a robe that will give you another +10. Appraise is by no means a must, but I also found nothing better to invest on. I thought maybe to use Animal Empathy, but after a while that becomes redundant. Consider the appraise points leftovers which can be invested as you see fit.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the only other thing that I changed on this guy is that I went for Str 14 and Con 10 for more damage, which is the main problem with this build for the first 20 levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
