UMD means high-level scrolls &amp; items are suddenly available.  A brief scroll wish list might be something like Magic Vest, Neg nrg Protect, Freedom,  Death Ward, Owl's Insight (+3 WIS AC)... just to mention a few defensive ones.  Now, that would mean at least 2 levels of bard (one for RDD prereq and at least 1 dump level to get at least 34 modified ranks).   With such a high AC, I wouldn't miss Armor Skin from one lost RDD bonus feat.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAbility spread<br/>\nWhy WIS 14... for WIS AC?  Seems AB is your main problem as 39 is lowish for level 40.  Even with the monk progression intact it will become difficult to hit once you've begun encountering hostiles over level 30 (I suppose you are depending on at least +10 kamas to help with that).  My start split would be  STR 12 (or 10)-DEX 18-CON 12 (or 14)-WIS 8-INT 14-CHA 8.  As far a STR goes, that's what all those magic bags are used for.  With a finesse build, STR does little... so even at 12, 2 more points seem wasted to me.  With DEX at 18 you'll be getting +1AC +1 reflex and sorely needed +1AB.<br/>\n<br/>\nSkills<br/>\nWhy such a high Search level?  Trap detection is a modal d20 roll plus Search ranks.  Maybe hidden doors?  At least for HotU, 10-15 ranks plus INT mod + d20 has been pretty reliable for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnderstand, it's been a long time since I played the Nether Scrolls and SoF modules so can't recall the monster stats or equipment spawns.  Comments/questions were based on a generic environment rather than a high-magic one like it appears this build is designed for.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I don't know anything about the Sands of Fate but it will be an issue since this guy's role is to melee.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, a bigger concern I have with this build is the lack of Uncanny Dodge on a Dex'er.  A STR of 22 means +6 to damage.  You can get the same by going Fighter and grabbing Weapon Spec and Epic Weapon Spec.  I think you're better off with a Monk 30 / Fighter 5 / SD 5 (or Monk 25 / Fighter 10 / SD 5)  with Epic Dodge, Epic Weapon Spec and Uncanny Dodge.  If you're worried about loot, throw some Lore in there to help ID items to see what you want to keep.  In the OC, there  are also plenty of STR enhancing equipment as well.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Monk is 3/4, so if you are Monk 20 you get a BAB of 15. This means that of you take 4 of those levels in a high BAB class you will get to 16. You can replace Monk with other Medium BAB classes, like Rogue, on a like-for-like basis, without changing the numbers. Then there's Cleric and Divine Power...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then you add the Monk's extra attacks if Unarmed or using Kamas. You get an extra attack at level 10 and another at level 20.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
