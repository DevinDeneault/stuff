      "content": "<div>Hey everyone !<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019m not sure where exactly this thread will be heading. But I couldn\u2019t find anything posted for this series of modules. I have not played them till the end yet and I\u2019m creating this thread to discuss various aspect of the module totally for my own benefit. But maybe other people will find the information usefull. I would like to specify that I am pretty noob and i suffer from severe Builditis. I am always trying different builds in different modules. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was searching for good modules to try out this series kept coming up as one of the best stories. Some people comparing it to Planescape Torment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe modules start with a prologue here :<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/module/prophet-prologue-it-cannot-be-denied\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://neverwintervault.org/project/nw ... -be-denied</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a text file with detailed information about the world and a walkthrough.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo without spoiling anything major. I wanted to talk about builds for this module. Hopefully a couple of you have played them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo initally i started a playthrough with Valerfor\u2019s  shadowknight build (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-shadow-knight-fighter-6-rogue-4-blackguard-10-t2351793.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the-shadow-knight-fighter-6-rogue-4-bla ... 51793.html</a>). Only changing the weapon feats. Then I somehow managed to missclick Hide points or something and I couldnt take BG at the right level and that turned me off from continuing that game. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I am thinking of going in with something along the lines of this dual purpose warrior from mick again (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/dual-purpose-warrior-fighter-8-bard-3-aa-9-t2349714.html?sid=c49654346e848b4dc4cb09a171eb2f08\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dual-purpose-warrior-fighter-8-bard-3-a ... a171eb2f08</a>). <br/>\n<br/>\nWould anyone have any type of builds to suggest for this module ? It seems to have alot of focus on ranger type gear but I allready got two ranger builds going in other modules.<br/>\n<br/>\nI finished ch1 on my bg playthrough. And I did not see any good warhammers. Was wondering if anyone remembers that type of 1h weapons they saw. I would probly go longsword but I\u2019m not sure anymore if i even saw any.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, pretty early we come up an enemy that is not plot essential and marked as impossible to kill. I tried several times to no avail. Is there a way to kill it that I havent figured out ? ( dont tell me how if the answer is yes).<br/>\n<br/>\nDont know if this is an appropriate module thread but let me know if it is not :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your input !</div>"

Who knows, we might even add a few new builds into our \"Free Level\" forum!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, <em class=\"mention\">@Vinleboiteux</em> !<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Reading a little more about the series (a prologue and 3 parts), it looks as if you can import your PC from the end of Honor Among Thieves (HAT - and I know Mick's played that!) into Prophet, as it's set in the same world and also made by Baldercan, and we know his stuff's good (iirc, he was involved in Rogue Knight's Swordflight series), or even go Cave of Songs, HAT, Prophet with the same PC.</div>",

      "content": "<div>Oh my bad about the shadowknight build. Fixed it. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes thats what I read about cave of songs and honor amongst thieves also. But both those modules favor stealthy roguy builds that im not sure I wanna play right now :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe end level of 12-15 is why I was looking at the level 20 builds thinking that alot of them must try to get the most out of their first 13 levels. I\u2019m also too much of a noob to make my own build. For just 13 levels I would probably just go pure something.<br/>\n<br/>\nPretty inclined to try out the dual purpose warrior. Sounds like not alot of people have actually played the modules so I will keep you posted :)</div>"

      "content": "<div>Just finished the prologue. Went with the Dual Purpose Warrior with longsword instead of warhammer just cuz its more elfy in my head.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe start at level 5. Am now level 6. I do feel my sword game is much stronger than my bow game. Especially on hardcore with AOO when using ranged weapons. This will probably balance out once I get AA levels. Maybe I will allready see a difference with level 6 and WS longbow and Point blank shot. Apart from that I am enjoying running around in heavy armor and switching between both weapons. Its pretty smooth and feels flexible enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe module has some really cool dream sequences with funky visuals ( a giant floating mouth for one..). The areas feel full of life and textured. I think they are quite well done but I havent really played alot of modules yet to compare. There is an eerie immersive feeling to the whole module enhanced by the music and audio. The dialogues are quite good and unique. I actually read most of it fully and not skim through them. Trying not to spoil anything. Will be updating more as i go :)</div>"

Not having any issues yet on D&amp;d Hardcore.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like the story in this module. It feels different. Im going to go into a but more details but it will be slightly spoilery.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Basically you are presented with two paths. I finished both. Heading towards the next destination. Had to wade through a very frustrating Marsh. I do not know if this was intentional but navigating in the marsh is horrible. Some water areas you can walk through, orhers you can\u2019t. They don\u2019t appear differently on your map. So it was really slow and annoying. Kind of like a real marsh I guess. Had one really cool encounter where I got cursed and to lift the curse I had to eat a guy\u2019s heart to travel into to slay his rage demons and eventually chop down a tree\u2026. Funky stuff\n</details></div>"
