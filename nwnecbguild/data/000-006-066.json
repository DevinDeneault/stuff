      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Kensai means \"Sword Saint\" in Japanese and it is the title that only the masters of the sword, those that are devoted in all their life to sharpen thir skills with it, eventually get.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey are often well educated - religious persons too, studying a lot and trying to improve in all of their aspects.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when the time for battle has come nothing is to be feared more than the naked blade of a Kensai...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n* This is an RP character of short i made for my avatar Doji Seo while i was playing on WoG. It is primarily designed to be very effective against any type of opponents and to be extremly playable from start to finish, virtually having no weaknesses.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut most of all, i wanted a character that would bring a smile on my face every single time i was playing her. Bringing in the concept of a Kensai i can imagine nothing less than a Katana or a Greatsword (Odachi or NoDachi as it is called) to be acceptable<br/>\n<br/>\nand of course suh a character could not have low saves or only a few skills, she should have many options to choose from (remember the strive for excellence).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe closest character i have found is the one made by Camiryn back then, named also \"Kensai\" but even that had too few Monk levels for what i wanted.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat i wanted was the \"perfect self\" class feauture - resembling the heightened state such blademasters get before a fight, i wanted the best possible ammount of SR i could squize in, and lastly i wanted to reflect things like extreme focus on paper and in play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThus a character that is almost impossible to knockdown/disarm was born, versed in a variaty of skills, with strong saves, that transcends the mundane boundaries and elevates into something else, something better.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlmost impossible to watch, Dodji Seo darted from enemy to enemy cleaving her way to forty in the fastest of ways, huge criticals, dazzling speed, knockdown after critical after whirlwind attacks, she eliminated all in her path in a race to ascension.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd she always brought a smile to my face.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n** Whilst this is an RP character the same build can be optimized far from it. You can gain as much as 3 more AB with the same build and 4 extra damage/ attack simply by changing her starting stats. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you wish you can trnasform her into the cousin of Hulk (half-Orc) forget the save booster prer-epic and take the glorious farm implement (scythe), get rid of the ESF in Discipline and take an additional great strength and then unleash some monster<br/>\n<br/>\n that crits for plus 300 easily while you still have all the rest bonusses. AC will be reduced only by 1, fortitude by 2 and you will loose some hp's. By all means do that if you want, this build purpose from the start was to be extremely flexible and there are <br/>\n<br/>\nenough feats &amp; skills to accommodate to your individual needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>WHIRLWIND OF STEEL</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>(Monk 25/ Fighter 8/ Wm 7)</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n RACE: Human<br/>\n<br/>\n ALIGNMENT: Lawful Any<br/>\n<br/>\n PLAYABILITY: PvM 1-40<br/>\n<br/>\n STARTING STATS:<br/>\n STR  - 15<br/>\n DEX -  14<br/>\n CON - 14<br/>\n INT  - 14<br/>\n WIS - 12<br/>\n CHA - 08<br/>\n<br/>\n ENDING STATS:<br/>\n STR  -  30<br/>\n DEX  -  14<br/>\n CON  - 14<br/>\n INT   - 14<br/>\n WIS  - 12<br/>\n CHA  - 08<br/>\n<br/>\n Hit Points: 470<br/>\n<br/>\n Skill Points: 271<br/>\n<br/>\n Concentration: 43 (45)<br/>\n Discipline: 43 (63)<br/>\n Tumble: 40 (41)<br/>\n Spellcraft: 19 (20)<br/>\n Intimidate: 4 (3)<br/>\n Heal: 13 (14)<br/>\n Hide: 43 (45)<br/>\n Move Silently: 43 (45)<br/>\n<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fort/Ref/Will): 26/ 24/ 20  --&gt;  30/ 28/ 24  Vs spells &amp; (mind effects immunity) &amp; (Improved evasion)<br/>\n<br/>\n Naked AC: 28  (mundane clothes) &amp; (expertise)<br/>\n<br/>\n SR: 35<br/>\n<br/>\n BAB: 28<br/>\n<br/>\n AB: +43/ +38/ +33/ +28  (NoDachi)<br/>\n<br/>\n DMG: 2d6 +21 / 15-20 x 3  (NoDachi)<br/>\n<br/>\n 2/Day Empty Body for 25 Rounds each<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLEVELING GUIDE:<br/>\n<br/>\n01) Monk (01): Dodge, Mobility<br/>\n02) Fighter (01): WF: NoDachi<br/>\n03) Fighter (02): Blind Fighting, Expertise<br/>\n04) Monk (02): <br/>\n05) Fighter (03): <br/>\n06) Fighter (04): Spring Attack, WS: NoDachi<br/>\n07) Monk (03): <br/>\n08) Monk (04): <br/>\n09) Monk (05): Whirlwind Attack<br/>\n10) Weapon Master (01): <br/>\n11) Weapon Master (02): <br/>\n12) Weapon Master (03): Improved Critical: NoDachi<br/>\n13) Weapon Master (04): <br/>\n14) Weapon Master (05): <br/>\n15) Weapon Master (06): Toughness<br/>\n16) Weapon Master (07): <br/>\n17) Monk (06): <br/>\n18) Monk (07): Great Fortitude<br/>\n19) Monk (08): <br/>\n20) Fighter (05): <br/>\n21) Fighter (06): EWF: NoDachi, EWS: NoDachi<br/>\n22) Monk (09): <br/>\n23) Fighter (07):<br/>\n24) Fighter (08): ESF: Discipline, Epic Prowess<br/>\n25) Monk (10): <br/>\n26) Monk (11): <br/>\n27) Monk (12): Great Strength I<br/>\n28) Monk (13): <br/>\n29) Monk (14): <br/>\n30) Monk (15): Great Strength II<br/>\n31) Monk (16): <br/>\n32) Monk (17): <br/>\n33) Monk (18): Great Strength III<br/>\n34) Monk (19): <br/>\n35) Monk (20): <br/>\n36) Monk (21): Great Strength IV<br/>\n37) Monk (22): <br/>\n38) Monk (23): <br/>\n39) Monk (24): Great Strength V<br/>\n40) Monk (25): Armor Skin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n SPECIAL NOTES: <br/>\n<br/>\n 80% Speed (multiplied by haste)<br/>\n<br/>\n Spell Resistance 35<br/>\n<br/>\n Extreme Discipline skill<br/>\n<br/>\n Wholeness of body 50 hp/day<br/>\n<br/>\n Immune to disease &amp; Poisons<br/>\n<br/>\n Immune to fear, charm, daze, stun, confusion, domination, bigby's VI, sleep, bane and lots of other harmful effects<br/>\n<br/>\n Twice a day etherealness for 25 Rounds each (undispellable 50% concealment)<br/>\n<br/>\n Damage reduction 20/+1<br/>\n<br/>\n Stunning fist 25/ day \u2013 DC 31<br/>\n<br/>\n Even unarmed she hits for 1d20 +10 with as many as 7 attacks per round and with a 39 AB<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n COMBAT OPTIONS: Improved Knockdown, Expertise, Cleave, Whirlwind Attack<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I was trying out a dev crit build and never thought of taking as many as 25 monk levels. Compared with what I ended up with, you give up the WM AB bonus and epic feats.<br/>\nIt is interesting to see what all that monk brings to the build, even though it is not quite optimized power wise like you say.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Totally missed that thread Mick, although i am acquinted with Ko' di 's Blademaster.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me put my 2 coppers into what i think for the Monk/ WM/ FTR combo's here instead, since it is relevant.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving only 6 levels of Monk does no good man except on special cases, unlike the FTR/WM/RG combo the Monk investment requires more levels to pay off. What do you typically take with 6 Monk levels?<br/>\n<br/>\nCleave, Evasion and IKD, and you are able to wear the Sun Soul boots and use special gloves in case they have a special buff into them like we have on WoG for example. And kamas of course eh.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat 5 levels of Rogue gives you instead? UMD which means you can use all these and much much more, evasion, and 3d6 of sneak attack, and trappfinding.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow IKD from Monk could be really useful if we could put a 10 in INT and be done with it, but we cannot. We need 13 INT &amp; DEX just for the requirements. So the chances are that we usually can and will take IKD ourselves anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of taking the minimum levels of Monk to make a Blademaster, the strength of the class when it is used in this combo, is revealed when we use many more levels, more Monk gives us more special abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving 9 levels already gives you Improved Evasion which is good but hardly what we really need. Taking 13 levels we become immune to poisons and take some early spell resistance but we are not there yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaking 18 levels you can dublicate the improved Invisibility twice a day and it is undispellable. Now taking twenty levels you get the Mind - effects Immunity which is a really nice ability. Now that's special!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what is the optimal split in case we powergame as much as possible and we wanted to be something different from the rogue combo's ?<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me tell you the answer since i have Dodji's Build in no less than six different alterations. Monk 20/ Fighter 4/ WM 16. That's it. With this spread you can have something distinguished and with really good AB.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it worth it though? Probably if you play in a server that you spend much time close to forty. For ease of play and constant performance though Monk 25/ WM 7/ FTR 8 would be my choice every time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat else that combo give us you ask? More speed which is really nice to have since you can escape time stops, taunts, can IKD mages before they know you are there e.t.c and more AC as well, +5 AC to be specific.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is why i have settled with that split in case of my blademaster. Having +5 AC, All Monk special abilities, some good 35 SR, and a really nice 80% speed buff is definitely worth it for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of these matter in low to medium magical environment such as \"WoG\", \"Kharindale\" or \"The North\" for example.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPower wise as you said the build isn't optimized although you can change that easily still maintaining the same build.<br/>\n<br/>\nStart with STR (18) DEX (14) CON (10) INT (14) WIS (08) CHA (08) and replace the ESF in Discipline with another GR. STR feat. There, 45 AB whilst still Human with zero exp penalties.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk don't get a negative AC for starting with 08 WIS, so AC is down by 1 only. AB is 2 more and DMG is plus 3.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an answer to your thread i would say that either Monk 10/12 or Monk 20/25 would be my final choices depending on the environment and my necessities for more AB.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the point is that having only a handful of Monk levels isn't worth the trouble unless you like Kama's, i would go with Rogue is such cases.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your input and suggestions man!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hey man!<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I disagree that 20 levels for the Mind Effects immunities are worth the investment (it's 14 levels you're investing, man!). I understand your thought process, but I don't think it applies to my playstyle. I'd probably be more inclined to go for a Kama-wielding Monk 9 / WM 19 / Fighter 12 or Monk 6 / WM 22 / Fighter 12 (the bad thing here being waiting till level 37 to get IKD). I don't know what a NoDachi is, so I can't say anything about that, but I can say this: you could drop Great Fortitude and Fighter for CoT levels. You'd lose 6 damage, which is hardly a problem for this build, but you'd gain +1 Fort, +4 Will and +4 Reflex and 2 feats, which could be taken in pre-epics or epics, in pre-epics you could take Disarm / Improved Disarm and in epics you could add two Great Strengths by rearranging things a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm saying this because I think CoT is a better fit RP-wise for a sword saint (champion of a god or a cause x just a plain warrior) and it does give you some nice boosts that are about 50-50 with the Fighter's WS / EWS contribution to the build. Without Fighter you'd need to rearrange your feats and levels and delay WM a little, but I think it'd be worth the trade.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, another nice speedy truck !<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

One of my first commissions in the guild and one build i really loved back in the day. For a naturally agressive player like myself having all impportant factors in one build was a godsend. Natural (32) Strength plus a Greatsword plus weapon master's criticals plus insane speed boost from monk meant serious business and i played this build in both Aielund saga &amp; WoG with great success. Sure having a natural AB of (only?) 44 may seem a bit low -for a weapon master- but in general i never had problem with that, never in modules or PW's anyway. I would not do PvP with this character thought, there are others more suited to this task...<br/>\n<br/>\n Now to proceed and clear some misunderstandings here...<br/>\n A Dai-Katana OR a ZweiHander OR an O-Dachi is the same very thing as your beloved and known to all of you <strong>Greatsword</strong>. Or else you would have seen a feat for exotic weapons somewhere in there. Now some of the modules or PW's incorporate the famous CEP 2.3 in them and allow for visual modifications of the swords as to look like a katana or anything else but the weapon is the same in every factional way and the build works flawlessly with that.<br/>\n<br/>\n I hope that helped, and no-i do not play- Nwn2 since it shares very little to the Original game that i loved.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

However, me being me, I can't help but muse over a change or two...<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder whether - given the excellent katanas available in Aielund - whether specializing in that weapon might be a nice idea. I appreciate that I'd be doing it without a shield, to protect Monk goodies, and I'd need WProf:Exotic, but I could push Blind Fight back to 15 and drop either Toughness or Great Fort, neither of which would be too much of a strain, I believe.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, in terms of skills, Taunt is heavily used in Aielund, so I'll want to keep Concentration, but I might sacrifice one of the stealth skills for Listen.

And considering that Aielund itself forbids the use of Dev-Critical feat you certainly have the necessary feats available to take \"Exotic Weapons\" and use it. However, that would be a flat-out downgrade to your damage as Kensai. You see, even though Katanas in Aielund are somewhat more powerful than other weapons, they still can't compare to the multiplication by 1.5 times of your entire (enhanced in the game) strength. Having said that, if you want to use a Katana as your Kensai's weapon of choise, you can surely take it, there are available feats for that, i am just here to note the differences and warn you of the outcome. And do not forget that the No-Dachi (Greatsword) has better base damage, does not require an extra feat and even has better reach in-game (proven by Hip). That being said i am sure you will do fine in Aielund either way Stag ;)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Only take Concentration when either Fighter or Monk classes are being taken, and only take Tumble, Hide and Move Silently when taking a Monk class (it may be better to think of Tumble as bundles of 5 ranks each time you take it). You will need to cross-class Intimidate and Spellcraft, because neither are available to Fighter or Monk as class skills, and you need the Intimidate ranks before you can take WM. That means you can take only 2 ranks in the skill at level 1 rather than the usual 4, then you can drop the other 2 in (excluding levels 3, 4 and 5) before starting your WM levels. Similarly, Spellcraft is only available on alternate levels, and costs 2 points for every one you allocate. Heal is only there for niceness - if you're struggling, take it later.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this makes a bit of sense at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd welcome aboard, lil!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
