And I am following the builds and comments, honestly.<br/>\n<br/>\n Actually, Hip, whatever your intentions, this is invaluable work on your behalf. Not only does it bring forth builds and discussions that the relative newcomers amongst us haven't encountered before alongside (albeit inadvertent - perhaps) hints and tips, but it also, perhaps more importantly, triggers the imagination for what's possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n For example, while pursuing my current prospective L40 build, I started wondering about changes and/or improvements to suit <em>me</em> (sod the rest of you <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" />), which got me wondering about a Monk/DwD build. At first I thought, \"dumbass\", but looking through Hip's new analyses I saw a build which boosted both DEX and CON, which gave me hope. Now, I know Empyre's actually constructed one such build (nothing's original any more - waah!), but nonetheless, without Hip's application and past builders' pushing characters into new territory, I couldn't have grown in my appreciation - and indeed my determination to produce a viable alternative to Empyre's build.<br/>\n<br/>\n This probably reads back very poorly (had a sherbert), but it's really just a big thank you - to Hip and the rest of the great and good.<br/>\n<br/>\n \"Standing on the shoulders of Giants\" (Isaac Newton, of his success)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Though I gobble up praise like a starving beggar, my efforts are not solely as they appear.\u00a0 I'll give you the full picture since you have been so astute to recognize the tip of the iceberg.<br/>\n<br/>\n Over a year ago, Max, Black Cobra and I began to entertain the idea of providing a means to find builds that meet a specific set of user-defined requirements here within the new ECB knowledge base. Towards that effort I began creating a spreadsheet by manually transcribing key values (I call them \"characterizations\".) that we believed others would find useful in their hunt to find suitable builds. Ideally, we wanted to merge our efforts with the legacy archive.\u00a0 Originally, we planned to host an SQL database on a free server to perform in a similar fashion as the now-defunct Concast site that WoG was using for the Search engine.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, a year later, my fellow conspirators have been overwhelmed by RL issues (not really that much of a surprise if you think about it) and I've decided to finish where I left off now that I have a window of opportunity.\u00a0 But I have no discipline. I should be merely doing a simple transcription but my builder instincts are constantly forcing me to take a more detailed look at builds I've never seen before as I scour each build to find the characterization values.\u00a0 Hence, it becomes a slower, more tedious process than it should because of my character flaws (I'm one of those people who use to drive students and instructors alike totally mad with all the inquisition and forced accountability during lectures i.e. Would somebody please shoot that guy with his hand up all the time? *lol*).<br/>\n<br/>\n The current form is an Excel Spreadsheet, plus either a comma-delimited or tab-delimited version (not sure which format has the best value yet) for those who use other speadsheet software than Excel but still would like the raw data for import. In time I hope to transition over to the on-line SQL database, but that will take significantly more time because, though SQL is fairly straight-forward and easy to learn, it is a new language for me to get accustomed to using and I do not want to delay the utility any longer than necessary for my training.\u00a0\u00a0 Interest in building NWN toons has been waning and I fear the door is closing... fast.<br/>\n<br/>\n So you may occasionally see me commenting on builds where the author may be on sabbatical or even retired. But the contributions are still active, completed builds so if some element left unaddressed jumps out at me, I will try to point out the issue if it doesn't take me too long.\u00a0 I'm glad you are seeing some value in the reply and, by all means, if it triggers additional thoughts or questions on your part, feel free to resurrect the discussion.\u00a0 If you've read the builds in the legacy archive you'll recognize that it is never too late for further dissection.\u00a0 The NWN faithful are among the most persistent of all gamers. ;)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Ah - I hear the tinkle of a penny dropping! Thanks for the explanation, Hip, a laudable undertaking.<br/>\n<br/>\n Am now recovered from a single malt hangover, but am still keen to check my understanding (I too am a \"please, sir, what does that actually mean?\" chap. The life unquestioned being not worth living and all that). So, is the intention that one could search for a suitable build(s) via things other than class/spread? Such that one could look for (for example) non-Dev Crit evil halfling builds with dual-wield axes, should that float one's boat. And lo, the hundreds of possibilities appear before one's eyes to compare and contrast. If so, wowser (technical term)!<br/>\n<br/>\n I truly do appreciate the benefits of such a system, although I do see one potential downside (boo), which you touch upon yourself - that being the waning of interest in building NwN toons. If there are hundreds, nay, thousands of easily accessible uber-toons that are instantly accessible, it would take a particularly enquiring mind to not just grab one and run away. Thus, levels of understanding diminish and few are then<em> able</em> to create new and viable builds. In effect, the ECB becomes author of its own demise.<br/>\n<br/>\n Don't get me wrong, there's nothing intrinsically wrong with us becoming a vending machine, but - as was done to me, and I've seen you do it to others - encouraging new members to construct their own builds (and post them) is surely the lifeblood of the Guild?<br/>\n<br/>\n Of course, the vending machine option does allow you to dismiss dumb questions such as this (I suppose I just got fed up with pretending I understood): What's DC, and what does it mean? (And no, I don't mean Devastating Critical, Direct Current, District of Columbia, or even the comic book publisher - although, to be fair, I don't know what that stands for either, presumably 'something comics'). I looked in Kail's guide to acronyms, but felt none the wiser.<br/>\n<br/>\n Actually, I now have a supplementary question about Dev Crit. I notice that some builds are declared as having a Dev Crit of 48 or 41 or whatever. Is that about the likelihood of achieving a Dev Crit on a target? Or something else?<br/>\n<br/>\n Bet you're glad you replied now, aren't you? <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
