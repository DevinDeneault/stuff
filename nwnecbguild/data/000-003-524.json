What's that? \n<blockquote><div>\nThey would go into battle with a sword and bolter.\n</div></blockquote>\nIs this the kind of attack you seek for this Talos guy?\n<blockquote><div>\nThen one thing I've got as a definite is the race being human but I've been thinking maybe a cleric/rouge/sd?</div></blockquote>\nAre you intending to simulate a bolter's attack?  The only thing I can think of that can do that is either Magic Missile or Isaac's Missile Storms.  You seem to be equating a cleric with an apothecary and clerics really don't use any missile-like attacks that I can think of (maybe Searing Light but that is for undead and Neg Energy Ray is weak).  Arcanists can enchant weapons with GMW &amp; Flame Weapon.  Clerics are better enhancers, though, with Divine Favor, Darkfire and GMW.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mythology is interesting but doesn't really stereotype the toon itself.  What an Apothecary does in that game is also not clear. Is this guy supposed to be good or evil or doesn't it matter?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far what we have is a Human Level 40 stealth build that uses both a sword and an artillery attack of some sort.  For the best stealth, it would need to be a highly-skilled DEX build of some sort and that usually means high AC to boot.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow much credence would be given to spellcasting and buffs?  24 Levels are necessary in the spellcasting class to become indispellable.  You may or may not care about that though.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleric/Rogue/SD (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build228531.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> is one made by Kail that is for a halfling but should be able to be modified for Human) is fine if that's what you want, but it doesn't \"seem\" to emulate the character you are specifying.  Just about any class can be made stealthy with the right class combo but few can provide a missile attack while holding a sword.  Stick with it and we should be able to concoct something interesting.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
