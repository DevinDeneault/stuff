Led me to go Fighter/Weaponmaster/Rogue, and looking at other builds I decided on a Rogue13/Fighter8/WM19 split.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd good lord, is it hard to squeeze in all the feats for this. The need to go Ambi/TWF right off the bat sets me back, and now my little list is down to level 13 and I've got Weaponmaster levels online, but still haven't found room for Weapon Specialization in either weapon. Considering a R13/F14/WM13 split, just because of how feat-hungry the build is.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat and I second-guess myself constantly. Oh, well. Time to go to bed, and tomorrow find another envelope and spend a few hours on the wiki.</div>"

But you start to feel the need for more fests, and it is tempting to weaken the build by taking more fighter and less weaponmaster.</div>",

      "content": "<div>Hi TychoVelius - I too am a pencil and paper aficionado, good to see there are still a few of us left!<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to echo what Mick and Empyre have said. If you go with two types of weapon with WF, WS, Imp Crit and WoC in both - together with Blind Fight, KD and Weapon Finesse - that's a total of 18 feats pre-epic! If you dual-wield with one type of weapon, that's still 14, which is do-able (assuming a human character) with 10 levels of Fighter pre-epic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a quick look through Hip's Guild Filter for something that might be helpful for illustration and Maximillian Kane's Drow Fencer popped up. He opts for a single rapier build in a Fighter 14/ Rogue 19/ WM 7 construction. Being an elf means a 20% xp penalty for much of the build and the sacrifice of the bonus feat at level 1 for being human. However, even with such a relatively small WM input he manages to get an AB of 47, which is pretty damned good.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Ninja'd by Valerfor, but I'll keep it anyway<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep us posted on your progress!</div>",

I'd refer you to my Drow Fencer build, which has exactly one of the spreads mentioned by Valerfor (FTR 14 / WM 7 / ROG 19), and it's overall VERY strong and playable.

Even though Ranger / Monk would probably save you many feats for dual-wielding / utility, you'd still be stuck with all the heavy WM requirements and ZERO bonus feats from Fighter or CoT to help you reach them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the lesson here is that SOMETHING has to give. Either you drop WM or dual-wielding or dual-weapons. Why go through all that trouble just to have a slightly better weapon on the main hand than off-hand? If you want a Fighter / WM dual-wielder, why not go dual-dagger and Halfling? Higher AB and AC, no penalties involved, since dual-wielding daggers is doable, and there are some pretty sweet daggers on WoG too!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>",

IMO, what would change the build the least would be just going with the same weapon in both hands. You're saving up a lot of feats that way, which will get you what you need.<br/>\n<br/>\n@ Stag<br/>\n<br/>\nYou still only have so many feats, not counting bonus feats, here's the math:<br/>\n<br/>\n1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 - these are the GENERAL feats you get, which adds up to 7 (8 if you're Human)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's what he'd need to be able to get all he wants in this build: <br/>\n<br/>\nExpertise, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus (x2 if going for 2 Weapons), Two-weapon Fighting, Ambidexterity, Improved two-weapon fighting, Knockdown (on WoG, if you don't have KD, it's impossible to solo, Especially being new and unfamiliar with the server)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis adds up to 12 feats, which is 4 more than he possesses already, and they're just the bare minimum, there are a few VERY USEFUL feats that aren't there either: Weapon Specialization (x2 if you go for 2 weapons), Blind Fight and even Improved Critical (x2 for 2 weapons) and IKD.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm no mathematician, but even I know that'll be very hard to achieve without taking Pre-epic feats in epics, which, as Mick mentioned, weakens the build overall, because every pre-epic feat you take in epics is one less epic (better) feat you take. Furthermore, although it could technically be compensated by Fighter bonus feats, every Fighter level he takes beyond level 8 will weaken the build, because he'll be taking 1 more pre-epic feat by trading 6 WM for 6 FTR levels, but at the cost of 2 AB from Superior Weapon Focus in the final spread. That's a bad tradeoff.<br/>\n<br/>\n@Tycho (conclusion)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you see, Tycho, you're just trying the impossible. But, don't toss out your idea just yet. IMO you can maintain the main idea if you swap WM for CoT. Fighter / CoT / Rogue is a VERY feat-heavy build and you'll be rid of the heavy WM requirements, from which this concept won't be able to extract as much benefit due to level constraints. Then you'll have so many bonus feats it may actually be doable. Something like Fighter 14 / CoT 10 / Rogue 16 could work. Why don't you try building that?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yeah, as Mick pointed out, Rogue alone will allow you to qualify for Epic Dodge.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>",

You want to reserve those slots for epic feats. Epic feats are normally more powerful. And you can only take them in the epic levels.\n</div></blockquote>\nSorry Mick, but I'm not suggesting delaying pre-epic feats to epic levels, unless I've missed something. My thought was simply that delaying taking Weapon Master until post-level 20 might actually give a bit more leeway at earlier levels, rather than rushing for WM asap. It was only a thought, though.</div></blockquote>\n\n@ Stag<br/>\n<br/>\nYou still only have so many feats, not counting bonus feats, here's the math:<br/>\n<br/>\n1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 - these are the GENERAL feats you get, which adds up to 7 (8 if you're Human)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's what he'd need to be able to get all he wants in this build: <br/>\n<br/>\nExpertise, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus (x2 if going for 2 Weapons), Two-weapon Fighting, Ambidexterity, Improved two-weapon fighting, Knockdown (on WoG, if you don't have KD, it's impossible to solo, Especially being new and unfamiliar with the server)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis adds up to 12 feats, which is 4 more than he possesses already, and they're just the bare minimum, there are a few VERY USEFUL feats that aren't there either: Weapon Specialization (x2 if you go for 2 weapons), Blind Fight and even Improved Critical (x2 for 2 weapons) and IKD.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm no mathematician, but even I know that'll be very hard to achieve without taking Pre-epic feats in epics, which, as Mick mentioned, weakens the build overall, because every pre-epic feat you take in epics is one less epic (better) feat you take. Furthermore, although it could technically be compensated by Fighter bonus feats, every Fighter level he takes beyond level 8 will weaken the build, because he'll be taking 1 more pre-epic feat by trading 6 WM for 6 FTR levels, but at the cost of 2 AB from Superior Weapon Focus in the final spread. That's a bad tradeoff.\n</div></blockquote>\nOh bloody hell, I'm clearly not explaining myself very well here.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I'm trying to ask is if there's a case to be made - assuming WM is taken - for taking the class only in epic levels? I believe I recognized that up to 18 pre-epic feats would be needed in an earlier post (as well as pointing to your Drow Fencer build as a potential way forward) from the original concept. And I wasn't advocating a Ranger/Monk build, just observing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, it's TychoVelius' thread, so I'll shut up now (though I do like your build, Max - it's even one I'd play! So it's probably a bit dodgy<span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83d\ude09</span>). Though my question remains unanswered...</div>",

You lose 2 pre-epic BAB that way. You also only have 1 Rogue level left for skill dumps in epics.<br/>\n<br/>\n2- you swap 6 Fighter for 6 WM, losing 2 epic feats and 2 AB from SWF for 3 pre-epic feats so you can have more fighter pre-epic. You end at Ftr 14 R 13 WM 13<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you see, both alternatives to delaying WM are a bad tradeoff.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>",
