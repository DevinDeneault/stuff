I know she's far from perfect, but I believe her to be better able to hold her own against anyone. I know you'll correct my delusions anyway!<br/>\n<br/>\n I've given her access to Epic Dodge 4 levels earlier, which I didn't think possible, so please let me know if my calculations are off. I'm also aware that her first few levels will be damned hard work, but hopefully her luck and cuteness will take her through...<br/>\n<br/>\n Two other little things: i) I kept her class spread and raw stats the same on purpose, just to see if I can make a better build with the same raw material (the extra 18 skill points didn't hurt); and ii) I've swapped Power Attack and Cleave for the Knockdowns, which should please Valerfor anyway!<br/>\n<br/>\n Enough preamble:<br/>\n<br/>\n MANCY FENTAN<br/>\n Fighter 16 / Rogue 14 / CoT 10<br/>\n Halfling, Female<br/>\n Lawful Good<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 13 (14)<br/>\n DEX: 18 (34)<br/>\n CON: 14<br/>\n INT: 14<br/>\n WIS: 8<br/>\n CHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n HPs: 464<br/>\n SPs: 274 -

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Stag, I like that you keep building - and learning. Now brace yourself! <br/>\n First: There are some illegal feats. You cannot take toughness, epic dodge, epic will and epic fortitude with fighter or CoT bonus feats. I know that you want all 7 great dex in there, and that's a good thing in terms of AB and AC focus. But with bonus feats you can only take what is on the feat list for that class. If you want toughness, epic dodge, epic will and epic fortitude in, you have to find another way. It is easy to move toughness to a general feat slot. It is harder in epic levels if you insist on taking great dex all the way, and you will also end up with 3 vacant epic combat feat slots unless you change the level distribution.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for skills: You seem to forget half the time that the charisma is 8 and end up with a modified UMD rank of 39. 39 is no better than 35 unless you plan on buffing cha with items or spells all the time.<br/>\n Spellcraft 18 (20) is spot on. <br/>\n The detect DC of standard epic traps is 42. With  a search skill of 38 (40) you will detect them most of the time. You have no ranks in disarm, so you have to rely on magic to remove the traps you detect, and that can work well if you have the right scrolls or artefacts.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks Mick, much appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\n Many responses to give - I'll try to group them sensibly...<br/>\n<br/>\n 1. The Feats - mea culpa on Toughness, I'd assumed (wrongly, as it transpires) that because CoT could take Epic Toughness as a bonus, the pre-epic would likewise be available. Arse, but as you say, not difficult to remedy. As to Epic Dodge, I looked at my earlier Mazzy build and found she received both ED and EWF as a Fighter (L10) at\u00a0 character level 33 and just got it the wrong way round as to which was the Feat and which the Bonus. Prat. As to Epics Will and Fortitude, I confess that I'd got myself tied up in a 'must increase saves' spiral when they weren't too shoddy in the first place. Berk. I shall return once I've seen what I can do....<br/>\n<br/>\n 2. The Skills - with UMD I had a mental aberration: while recognising on paper that UMD's bonus is from CHA, in my mind I had it from INT. Pillock. As to Search: genuinely did not know that the standard detect DC was 42 for epic traps, so hopefully forgiveable - good to know for the future. Ignoramus. I ummed and ahhed about whether to take any sps in Disarm, but three things prevailed (not necessarily wisely) - one, I figured that by epic levels at least they couldn't blow me to smithereens (and if they could, I could always reload - v bad form); two, I felt sorry for the Fighter ranks only having Discipline to play with as a class skill, so tried to chuck in some Concentration; and three, my poor brain was addled doing the sums (Empyre has marvellously provided a link for working these things through on an IT package, but at the moment I don't seem able to access it, so quill and ink it remains for now).<br/>\n<br/>\n Right then, back to the grindstone - thanks for everything!<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and a word to the wise, I'm currently mucking about with a Barbarian/Fighter/Rogue build, so be warned!<br/>\n<br/>\n Just one more thing, if I may....would there be any merit, sense or method of setting up a sort of 'Apprentice Builder' section on the site - just so we (by which I mean me) don't clutter up the 'Ooh, that's Good' threads?<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
