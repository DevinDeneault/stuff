      "content": "<div>Hi guys,<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm looking to replay OC, SoU, and HotU again and I've never played a paladin type character with divine abilities.\u00a0<br/>\nI was looking at some builds and I adjusted this build to suit me but I would like your opinion and thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to be a good guy, a persuasive guy with some two-handed weapon. I didn't decide that yet.\u00a0<br/>\nI put a greatsword in here but I could go axes or other two-handed weapons. Even two-bladed, although they suck a little I know, and then I would have to make this dex base build :/<br/>\nI replaced this build with a rogue instead of a fighter, but not so sure about it, this one is definitely stronger but lacks some skills.\u00a0<br/>\nI know I'll take Sharwyn or Tomi in the OC and the Deekin later so they can handle locked objects and traps so I can concentrate on damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan I replace fighter with something else, or maybe rearrange abilities and feats to make the most out of this build? The primary focus is PvM and role-playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks :)<br/>\n<br/>\nFighter/Paladin/Champion of Torm<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nAlignment: Lawful Good<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nStarting Abilities:<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nSTR - 15<br/>\nDEX - 10<br/>\nCON - 12<br/>\nINT - 12<br/>\nWIS - 14<br/>\nCHA - 14<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nFinal Abilities:<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nSTR - 25<br/>\nDEX - 10<br/>\nCON - 12<br/>\nINT - 12<br/>\nWIS - 15<br/>\nCHA - 18<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nAttack Bonus (Mundane Greatsword): 41/36/31/26<br/>\nDamage 2-12 +16<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nBase Attack: 30<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nArmor Class: 16<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHit Points: 379<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nSaves:<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nFortitude - 41<br/>\nReflex - 33<br/>\nWill - 32<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nSkills: Max out: Concentration, Discipline, Tumble, Persuade<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nFeats:<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n\u00a01.

      "content": "<div>Hello and welcome aboard ihrstic!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm afraid I don't pretend to be any kind of expert when it comes to Paladins, but we have others who will come along soon enough, but I might be able to help with a few other areas you raise.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I've added your levels up correctly, this is a Fighter 4/ Paladin 14/ CoT 22. You wonder about taking another class instead of Fighter. Presumably this would be for additional skill points and a full Tumble class. The only classes with Tumble as a class skill are Rogue, Bard, Monk, Assassin, Shadowdancer, and Harper Scout. You can rule out Assassin and Bard because of alignment conflicts. Shadowdancer and Harper Scout require feat and skills investments before you can take them, and you don't have much of either to spare. I'm going to beg you not to go for Rogue, because, while it's physically doable, there's a very long and intricate debate about the ethics of having Sneak Attack in a Paladin build, which we really don't need to open again. That leaves Monk, which would lose many of its inherent abilities when in armour or using neither fist nor kama (speed, Wisdom AC, Monk UBAB), but will still retain its Tumble boost to AC and Cleave, for example. It has a certain synergy with both other classes, so might be an option.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, if you drop Fighter, you lose 3 bonus feats and access to Epic Weapon Specialization, so you might want to think hard about whether it's worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI confess to being baffled why you take 25 Strength and 15 Wisdom. You always want to try to end on an even number to get any benefit from the stat. 25 Strength is worth the same as 24 (apart from access to Dev Crit, of course), and 15 Wisdom might as well be 14. I would advise going for 26 Strength and 14 Wisdom, and rearranging your epic feats so you don't \"waste\" that CoT bonus feat. You could, equally, take a second Great Wisdom instead of Epic Toughness, but what would be the point?<br/>\n<br/>\nI assume you know that HotU will finish with you at around level 28, and that you're supposed to start the OC and SoU with a level 1 character. If you want to take your build all the way to level 40 we can offer suggestions for you. If not, you might want to build for a level 28 character - again, help is available.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is longer than I intended - and I haven't even touched on CHA v STR Pallies. Anyway, something to think about before someone else comes along.<br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome to the Guild again!</div>",

I've put 25 strength for Dev Crit but I'll get it so late that it won't be so interesting anymore. As for Wisdom 15, I really didn't know what to take so, yeah that's why I needed some advice :). I think I'll go with this Divine Warrior build but I'll go for some two-handed weapon. I considered greatsword, great axe, halberd, and heavy flail. I don't know which one is the best. It's probably a matter of preference, and there are probably better magical greatsword in campaigns. I don't know about other 2H weapons, maybe you guys know which are better.</div>"

However, taking Daelan with you early on in the OC should be a help, and Dorna could be useful early in SoU (replaced by the brilliant Deekin later, of course). It's a build that really starts to come into its own in the mid-teens, power-wise, and then really starts to travel. Don't get me wrong, it's perfectly doable at lower levels, you just have to be more careful and creative in how you play her - for the gods' sake don't go barreling in to every fight that presents itself until you've started to accrue CoT levels!<br/>\n<br/>\nI like her lots, but then I'm biased.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",
