With the current rules you can end up with a negative xp per kill if you have enough non favored base classes.<br/>\nBuilds with front loaded classes may benefit from the change, but not necessarily builds focusing on classes that get better with levels, so there is a balance here somewhere.<br/>\nAs for balance, if this change allows for more powerful builds, it is not far fetched to assume that challenges on PWs and new modules will be tougher too.<br/>\nThat being said, I welcome the opportunity for renewed creativity that these changes spark.</div>",
