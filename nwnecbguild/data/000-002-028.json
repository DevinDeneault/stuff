But I don\u2019t wanna clog it up. <br/>\n<br/>\nReading the cleric guide (which is awesome) made me want to play a cleric. Been looking at all the ways they can be built. I feel like I wanna go Str. There is obviously the Mith\u2019s blood and Faith build (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/mith-s-blood-and-faith-cleric-26-bard-4-rdd-10-t515481.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">mith-s-blood-and-faith-cleric-26-bard-4 ... 15481.html</a>) . <br/>\nI also found Mick\u2019s Devastator build (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/devastator-priest-cleric-26-monk-4-cot-10-t2355164.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">devastator-priest-cleric-26-monk-4-cot-10-t2355164.html</a>). Right now I\u2019m leaning towards Mick\u2019s build just because I feel like getting the multiclasses earlier probly makes it more fun to play. Also I like the two weapon focus. I looked at most of the cleric builds in the level 40 section but maybe I missed some. These two were the str ones that I noticed. Some really cool dex based ones but I currently have an SoU playthrough with a dex based invisy type build (not cleric though).<br/>\n<br/>\nI am either gonna play it through OC + mines of the twin summit. Or \u2026. Swordflight. But I feel like I want some rogue skills/ persuade skills for swordflihht so not sure it fits.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions are welcomed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a question about Darkfire. Just got it on a char. The tooltip makes it seem like it can only be applied to mundane weapons ? Like a +1 weap wouldnt work?<br/>\nAlso it says the weapon becomes 1d6 dmg. Does that mean a 1d8 weapon will become 1d6? Am I reading this wrong ?<br/>\n<br/>\nTy in advance :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
