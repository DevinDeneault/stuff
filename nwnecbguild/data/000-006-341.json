I do not mind spending 100 GPs to identify something but then again I mostly play where gold isn't scarce; also, in SP at least one potion of lore let's you identify as many items as you want. I guess you know you can drink a potion of lore, pause the game and identify everything without the potion's effect wearing off (since you have paused the game) right?<br/>\n<blockquote><div>Cross-classed trap skills...

Trap skills, in my experience, are a big tactical advantage. If you are not into them though, it's all fine and dandy. Just wanted to point out the possibility to go for them, if one so desires. <br/>\n<blockquote><div>The concept is interesting, you might want to explore a heavier DwD version (say Druid 8/Shifter 10/DwD 22) and compare it to this one.</div></blockquote>\nI try to get more spell-casting abilities while unshifted...

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I also cringe at the overly-allocated CON level.  Unless you are planning on spending most of your time unshifted it makes little sense since the RL form will set its own CON level @19 (and the fort save associated with it).  Even if you simply reduced CON down to 12 or 14 the build would have loads of extra skill points to play with by boosting INT.  I don't think EDR is really practical with shifter because of all the overrides.  I would just do with the DR from DwD and let it go at that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few nuances about Risen Lord that seem to remain true on most servers (and Kail &amp; others can surely correct me per their own experiences), but an average cleric will easily turn a RL or just Heal him once or twice and swat him with an enchanted newspaper to finish the job.  I remember a particularly ugly encounter with my RL when I failed to notice a converging pack of duergar clerics whilst merrily dicing their friends and lasted a total of 5 secs once they had arrived within turning range.  This means it is best to develop a secondary, high SR, reliable form, like Rak to deal with those situations.  Druid caster vs. Cleric caster = smiling cleric, dead druid.  Considering a secondary form may also help you to redistribute your abilities much more efficiently.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other issue specifically about any undead shape is that heal potions do not work in combat, yet they work fine with all other forms (positive energy will not help undead).  And since no items can be used while in shifted from, you must unshift, heal, then reshift.  IIRC equipping regen items work (as does any sort of regen buff spell).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy main emphasis is: don't depend on a single form in every situation.  It will disappoint you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBe aware: all the feats related to weapon focus and proficiency are wasted on a shifter.  None of them change the shifted AB at all.  Unless you wanted to wield a scythe while unshifted, but why would you do that and get critted and sneak attacked?  Epic prowess is one of the very few AB boost feats that will help a shifted form.  Armor Skin also works as expected.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince Monk is the most natural tertiary for shifter builds, utilizing both the WIS AC and unarmed progression, it will be a tough call where to throw the excess ability points using DwD.  If it were me, I'd throw at least a few more into INT (and follow Kail's suggestion about developing some cross-class skill proficiency) unless you wanted to simply raise your druid caster DCs as high as possible.  I prefer to play a shifter as a shifter rather than a convenient method to gain some melee presence.  Druids casters are best at lvl 26 and higher.  It's a tough decision IMHO.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Only those weapon feats related to \"<strong>unarmed</strong>\" do not apply to unarmed shifted shapes (that happens because unarmed shapes are not technically unarmed but use creature weapons), and even then it's WF/EWF: Unarmed, WS/EWS: Unarmed and Devastating Critical: Unarmed not to work.

Unless you are planning on spending most of your time unshifted it makes little sense since the RL form will set its own CON level @19 (and the fort save associated with it).  Even if you simply reduced CON down to 12 or 14 the build would have loads of extra skill points to play with by boosting INT.  I don't think EDR is really practical with shifter because of all the overrides.  I would just do with the DR from DwD and let it go at that.</div></blockquote>EDR I-III stacks with DwD damage reduction for a grand total of 15/- damage reduction. This total score does not stack with 15/+3 of RL, but the best of the two (and consider that he reaches 15/- only at DwD 10) is applied so 15/+3 vs weapons up to +2 enchantment, and X/- vs +3 and better weapons. It might seem overkill for a damage soaker like RL, but I think that if someone is giving up Wis AC and classed tumble then he should get some other source of protection and EDR I-III qualifies for that. Have a look at my Graveyard Shifter build were I go for ED and EDR III to augment RL defensive nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting turned is definitely a big gripe.

Didn't test Improved Unarmed Strike (AoOs are just too tedious to test IMO.)but if Kail or others have, it would a good thing to know.  Looks like I will be throwing the shifter guide I based all my builds upon into the trashcan where it belongs.  Too bad <strong>Zelle's</strong> guide is no longer accessible   If any guild member had the foresight to copy those threads, I think it would make a valuable addition to the guild's resources.  I'd even be willing to distill all Zelle's versions down into a single parsed, compilation. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, here are the results of my testing:<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Feat Effects on Polymorph Forms: Shifters, vanilla NWN v1.69 (110730)</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nShifted shapes tested, unarmed: wyrmling, harpy, manticore, iron golem<br/>\n<br/>\nShifted shape tested,armed/Weapon<br/>\n<br/>\nMinotaur (pre-epic)/Battleaxe<br/>\nMinotaur (epic)/Greataxe<br/>\nDrider/Spear<br/>\nDrow Warrior/Long sword<br/>\nLizardfolk/Whip<br/>\nCommando/Short sword<br/>\nRisen Lord/Scythe<br/>\nAzer chief/Dwarven waraxe<br/>\n<br/>\nFeat/Shifted Shape types/Effect<br/>\n<br/>\nImproved Critical/Minotaur(both),Drider,Azer chief/Crit 19-20 x3<br/>\nImproved Critical/Lizardfolk,unarmed/Crit 19-20 x2<br/>\nImproved Critical/Risen Lord/Crit 19-20 x4<br/>\nImproved Critical/Drow Warrior,Commando/Crit 17-20 x2<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapon Focus/armed,unarmed/+1AB<br/>\nEpic Weapon Focus/armed,unarmed/+2AB (stacks w/WF for +3AB)<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapon Specialization/armed/+2 damage<br/>\nEpic WS/armed/+4 damage (stacks w/WS for +6 damage)<br/>\nWeapon Specialization/unarmed/no effect<br/>\nEpic WS/unarmed/no effect</span><br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore, the only change I would make to Kail's assessment is in regards to unarmed WF/EWF which do increase AB for all the unarmed forms I tested.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, back to the build...<br/>\n<br/>\nMy own preference would be to drop the Exotic Proficiency, WF: Scythe &amp; EWF: Scythe in favor of Improved Critical: Scythe (doesn't require Exotic Prof) and IKD.  That leaves a free feat for either Mobility (+4AC vs. AoO) or Expertise (+5AC/-5AB).  I like Expertise myself because in early levels, the wyrmling breath attack can be extremely effective plus is useful for a druid in casting mode.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that Imp Crit works for all forms really changes my thinking about shifter builds in general since it is a combat advantage that has no prereqs.  I will definitely give it more consideration in the future and with respect to this build, I would surely love a Risen Lord critting on twice as many hits as without it.  PvP against other Risen Lords it would be worthless, but would be great for PvM applications.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo go slightly OT for a moment...<br/>\n<br/>\nI am wondering if the above feats would have the same effects on non-shifter polymorphs, specifically the Iron Golem that arcane spellcasters use to get out of some sticky situations.  Too tired from testing to check this right now, but it would be good to know nonetheless.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, thanks D'Alessandro for posting this build so that my own shifter experience could be broadened.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

So that answers my second question about other non-shifter polymorphs  with regards to WF/EWF but how about the Improved Critical effect?  Will the monster weapons be affected by that feat regardless of whether they are shifter morphs or not?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll tell you, Kail... the value of the character sheet becomes less and less useful with each passing post.

I know you're just talking about size modifiers and I know that you know this as well, since it was you who taught me this bit, but to those with a little less knowledge than yourself or me, it may seem as if to find the correct AB in Dragon Shape you just take whatever the sheet shows you and subtract 2. So just to clarify to the readers here, the +6 Dragon claws aren't considered by the sheet either, so basically to find your AB / AC in Dragon Shape, you add 4 to (+6 from Dragon Claws, -2 from Size Modifier) and subtract 2 from the shown AC because of said Size Modifier. So AB/AC in DS = +4/-2 what is shown in your bugged Character Sheet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what the hell, since we are at it, to use combat debugging here is what you have to do: IN SINGLE PLAYER MODE ONLY.<br/>\n<br/>\n- press ` to enable commands.<br/>\n- type DebugMode 1 EXACTLY AS I DID here to enable cheats, you should receive a message that says: Success or something like that <br/>\n- type the following command: dm_enablecombatdebugging<br/>\n- type DebugMode 0 to disable cheats afterwards<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven't done that in a while, so I'm not 100% sure this is how you do it, but it's either this or something very similar to it, do any of you by any chance remember enough to assert whether the procedure above is correct?<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
