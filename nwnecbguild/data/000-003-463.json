She will be Lawful Evil, race will be human or elf not sure yet and most importantly she wil be a kensai path, which means you gain haste but can't use magical items, potions or ranged weapons. I'm looking for PvM and Pvp build as it's always useful.<br/>\n<br/>\npossibly a dex based build so I can be good at hiding and I'll need epic skill focus in hide and MS.</div>"

Or maybe a completely different strategy with Monk Wizard Red Dragon Disciple, STR-based with Dev Crit? If any of these sounds good to you, I'll build it for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this one of those servers that requires you to take 3 levels in a row of a class the first time you take the class?

      "content": "<div>I would say Monk Fighter Rogue is a bad idea if you can't use magic items, you're better off with some Cleric in there to compensate the lack of magical items with buffs. Monk 12 Cleric 15 Rogue 3 will do very well and with Haste he'll be able to flee any dangerous situation that he can't handle by kicking butt! Plus, you can get the Plant domain to have access to Barkskin, as you'll have haste as a Kensai.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

All melee-oriented classes are item-dependant, or at least more so than casters / self-buffers Taking 4 FTR pre-epic means his BAB will be 16, which is not good if you consider he will have to rely only on his stats to attack. With 12 Monk levels, he will do 1d12 damage, not the max, true, but still double what a Kama can do, and he will have Divine Power and Divine Favor at his disposal for +10 AB. Now EWS will give him a total of +6 damage with the chosen type of attack, while Divine Favor alone will give him +5 damage, plus whatever he can gain from Divine Power as a STR bonus and if you want, count in Battletide (+2 Magical damage and +2 AB, plus reducing enemy AB and damage by 2) and prayer (+1 AB and damage and if cast near the enemy will further reduce their AB and damage by 1). Not to mention Wisdom-based AC and Cleric WIsdom and DEX buffs. IMO Cleric is the best way to go for someone who won't use any magical items.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"
