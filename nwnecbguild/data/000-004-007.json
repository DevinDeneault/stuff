And your avoidance of an xp penalty is laudable. But I've a couple of thoughts, if that's ok?<br/>\n<br/>\nA Rogue without UMD? I'd be tempted to drop Dex by 1, Con by 2 and Wis by 1 and boost Int by 2 to max the skill. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I know that means Dodge and Mobility couldn't be taken, but I wouldn't take them anyway (and I'll come to Toughness later). Instead, I'd consider Luck of Heroes and Iron Will to help with the sucky Will save (a meleer's worst nightmare is not being able to melee, after all).<br/>\n<br/>\nI would have said bin Toughness as well and take a second WF in something blunt, but dropping the Con by 2 helps justify it, so I'd let it stand and take both it and Iron Will at levels 15 and 18 (your choice which way round, but I'd prefer Iron Will at 15).<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you don't mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

      "content": "<div>Thanks Stag,<br/>\n<br/>\nAll good suggestions. Dropping the Dex is a very good point as the extra point does nothing to contribute to anything now that I look at it. I could drop Wis too as I use clarity in the early stages and immunity items later against mind-affecting. The Int set at 8 is for RP flavour. One of my favourite things about the original campaign is low Intelligence dialogue; I love it. When I was a young fella I never understood who would want to play a dumb PC but now I think it's great. I'm going to head to Ye Olde Tavern to make a full post about this very thing. That's part of the idea with no UMD as well, as although it is a charisma skill, I just can't credit a really dumb half-orc being able to use a sophisticated magical item. But you're right on that count as far as effectiveness goes.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nElTalstro\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</div>"

I wanted mobility so he could sprint through quickly, and mercilessly hack down mages without their lackeys getting in too many cheap shots. Dodge I like for the extra AC and obviously it's required for mobility. I've never taken iron will or other save boost feats before; I try to use an immunity item for mind spells.

      "content": "<div>Well, that's fair enough, I suppose. Except that you'll be avoiding most AoOs by the time you reach a nett Tumble score of 14 in any case, which you'll do at level 12 here, so, if you're going to take Mobility you'll want it good and early - certainly not after it effectively becomes pretty much redundant. And the Dodge AC only applies to the enemy you're currently facing, so is of little use against mobs. My thinking was that boosts to your Will save give you a much better chance of actually reaching that mage before being rendered incapacitated, and you've been with us long enough to know that we don't do builds that are item dependent, because that means they're only really viable in an environment where those items are present. Admittedly, we can't get everything we want in a build (most times, anyway), and sometimes we don't have the feats or skills available to cover all our shortcomings, but that should be addressed in the preamble before presenting the build, so other potential users of the build are aware in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're melee-ing, and doing it well, a hit point total of over 400 (200 in a level 20 build) is perfectly respectable, so Toughness is hardly ever a must-have feat (though the tanking Dwarven Defender in me might wish to differ). I do see how it contributes here, though. But I do question taking it at level 1. Maybe that's just me.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, popping my pedant hat on for a moment, while I fully understand your reason for designating alignment as Neutral Evil, technically the build is any non-lawful - again for others who might want to try the build out. While we're always responsible for our own builds, once they're published they become public (well, Guild) property for folk to use as they see fit. All we can do is point out our builds' fair pros and cons as we give them up for broader consumption.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, I seem to have my serious suit on at the moment.
