      "content": "<div>Well, some of the good cleric spells like Divine Favor and Divine Power, as well as Darkflame, are horribly reduced in level - so the duration and damage is not that good.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example :\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Caster Level<br/>\nDarkfire \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 5<br/>\nDivine Favor \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a05 <br/>\nDivine Power \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 7<br/>\n<br/>\nThose are really not very good values IMO - Certainly not worth taking all those Cleric levels - one can basically get scrolls and wands of such from Merchants ingame.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few spells that are good, of course.\u00a0 But I just don't see it being worth being a crafter for Cleric stuff on WoG - even Bless and Aid are only Caster level 2, and 3.\u00a0 And Magic Vestment is limited to 5, as is Shield of Faith.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo is it really worth all the Cleric levels, for some Hammer of the Gods at 20?\u00a0 Some Healing at level 15?\u00a0 Implosion at 17?<br/>\n<br/>\nYMMV.</div>"

Nearly any Red-mage build could become a crafter &amp; even have a decent melee presence, depends upon the competence &amp; experience of the user mostly, in those complicated builds. Besides, you don't need to level him/her to forty, he is gonna burn exp all the time by crafting. Perhaps one could modify Max's\u00a0Magical-Master? <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the old ECB, you have classics like Gdl's War Wizard =&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build231822.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/buil ... 31822.html</a><br/>\npretty easy to also give him brew potions as well, thus having all three crafting feats (Scribe scrolls, Brew potions, Craft wands.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd even oddball builds could fill that role, with a little bit of polish, check Aerie =&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/minsc-and-other-bg-characters-t2354360-s80.html#p6411\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">minsc-and-other-bg-characters-t2354360-s80.html#p6411</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHere's a strong contender, with just a bit of shuffling he can have everything, even Dev Crit &amp; be super-effective, I just didn't have the time to make the modifications myself, but I have calculated everything &amp; it is easily done should you want it =&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-abjurant-champion-wizard-26-ftr-6-cot-8-t2354353.html#p742\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the-abjurant-champion-wizard-26-ftr-6-c ... .html#p742</a></div>"
