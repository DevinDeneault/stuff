And yes, Dwarves are pretty much the best race by far, even for mages. Half-Orcs pretty much only work for Pen &amp; Paper Barbarians where the lack of Intelligence don't hurt them so much &amp; they only want more Strength, they do everything with it. In Neverwinter Nights though, Barbarian Rage counts towards the ability cap, so they are at a net loss from this rule (it would have been so much better instead, to just gain dmg bonuses).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
