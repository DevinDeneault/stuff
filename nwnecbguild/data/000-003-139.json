But, before I went through that process, I wanted to ask the experts in the community. Is it feasible (realistically viable) to make a magical swordsman (as in) I mean a (elven race) Rogue/Wizard or Fighter/Wizard<img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /> (Within a cap of 30). I ask out of curiousity mostly to try and figure out about what 'type' of build I would like help in making. I would prefer a response, so that I might make a 'temp' build and get some appopriate help on it. If it's not at all 'workable' I'd also want that honest opinion so that I might change it up a bit and then present a new build for inspection.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Thank you for reminding me of the name xD<br/>\n I Intend to play on Arelith (Lv. 30 Cap.) (Hey, its RP and its got a lot of players, hopefully its a good home for me ^^) Figured I'd answer everything in one go!!<br/>\n<br/>\n Max Magic Level on gear? I don't know this. I do know that rings and such can at least get +1 on main stats and skills get +2? You can possibly enchant an item with everything, but I think the maximum possible with great success is two. However, it could be higher on high levels. The Max I heard of on an item was a +4 to a stat and it was a rare type deal (outside of crafting from other players) So, I'd assume +1 unless you get a talented player to craft stuff?<br/>\n<br/>\n Is there a lot of dispel spamming on the server? Sorta. With the correct number of UMD\u00a0 everyone and their grandmother could spam the living crap out of you with scrolled (and possibly wands) Mord's. They are very expensive though, so I don't really know how common these types of things are. Just know, a majority will have at least a few dispel type...things.<br/>\n<br/>\n Weapon/Shield or Dual-wield? I've always like the thought of dual-wielding. But, I do not have a preference, dual-wielding if feasible sure! If not, Sword and shield (I'll be just as happy going in sword and no shield if necessary) is perfectly fine.\u00a0 But, a Rapier is a must for me. Elf's can use it by default, and... I just like them overall (even though, some other weapons might be better)<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm perfectly okay with them just going in a robe if necessary, I think it might make more sense in lightish armor. But, I have no preference here. I imagine just the concept itself might be tricky.<br/>\n<br/>\n Class changes?<br/>\n Shadowdancer gets HIPS at level 5 instead of 1. Shadow evade lasts three rounds per class level instead of just 5. And +1 in hide for every level.<br/>\n RDD, Shifter, Pale Master, Assassin, Harper, and PDK are all under heavy restrictions, except PDK which just isn't plain supported.<br/>\n<br/>\n I don't know if these mattered, but here is a list of spell changes and their effects. It's a short read, but I didn't know if it was necessary for you to know or not. I'll post it anyway because... well it might!<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Spell_changes\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://wiki.arelith.com/Spell_changes</a><br/>\n<br/>\n Here is one for the Class changes as a whole, there's a lot of different changes (depending on the class, so I didn't know which one we needed) Please note that all Paths you may see are completely optional and not mandatory<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Class_changes\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://wiki.arelith.com/Class_changes</a><br/>\n<br/>\n If there is any more questions or answers needed I will be happy to respond, I don't know if I missed anything<br/>\n<br/>\n EDIT: I completely forgot to comment on my playstyle! I have no problem self buffing, but your second question that I\u00a0 answered may make it hard to maintain (though, I don't think monsters dispell as much ...only gotten to low level places though!) My familiar for recon? Yeah, I guess it's possible to do such a thing, but I kinda like the pixie type deal. (You know, it also being a rogue and such) As for summons, I don't think there's much an issue. For each conjuration focus you get more powerful summons. Ex. Spell Focus Conjuration: Giving you a level two summon instead of a level one (Greater) turning it into a three instead of 1. (Of course, epic furthers even level 9 summons I hear as well) Now, as a spell sword, I feel like I'd be doing more melee itself than spellcasting. But, I don't want either to be obsolete because of the other (though, if I have to focus in more one than the other) I'd like to be more on the spell side than the melee side.<br/>\n<br/>\n As a note: I want to get up to at least Epic Conjuration and Epic Evocation (if possible). All other feats are okay, but if wizard becomes the first level then Conjuration and Greater would be a must in the 1st and third levels as (its really the only way you can survive xD) If possible, I'd love to get Epic weapon focus Rapier as well, but that might be asking for too much.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

There are some changes to it, that whilst optional may or may not benefit the build as a whole. I will post the changes below.<br/>\n Sorcerer Changes:<br/>\n<br/>\n The Path of the True Flame can be chosen at character creation by sorcerers. Followers of the Path of the True Flame get unlimited spells per day, but can cast only evocation spells. This limitation includes spells cast from scrolls, wands, and items like potions; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Misc_Changes#Mundane_Items\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mundane items</a>, however, are the exception to the rule. Epic spells must also only be Evocation (this means Greater ruin and Hellball) however they can only be cast once per rest as per normal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Weave Master can be chosen at character creation by sorcerers. Weave masters get unlimited spells per day however they have a cool-down for all spells above the first level. The Cooldown formula is: (Spell level -1)*6 seconds.Example 1: 1st lvl spell (spell level of 1 -1 = 0) *6 seconds = 0 second cool-down (so you can cast 1st lvl spells normally as often as you want)Example 2: 5th lvl spell (spell level of 5 -1 = 4) *6 seconds = 24 second cool-down (hope that spell was worth it!)The cooldown timer is based on the <em>spell slot</em>, and not the actual spell itself. So spells modified with metamagic will increase the cooldown accordingly.Please note: <ul><li>The metamagic Feat \"Quicken Spell\", when used to cast a spell, will reduce the effective level of the spell by 1 when calculating cooldowns.</li> </ul><ul><li>Auto Quicken I: Spells of level 2-3 no longer have cooldown.</li> </ul><ul><li>Auto Quicken II: Spells of level 4-6 count as 2 levels lower, for the purpose of cooldown.</li> </ul><ul><li>Auto Quicken III: Spells of level 7-9 count as 3 levels lower, for the purpose of cooldown.</li> </ul> I don't know if this would be relevant in helping or not. But, those changes do allow one to not worry on terms of having some 'castable' spells. They will always have 'something' available. But, each one has a pro and con. True Flame cannot cast buffs and the like, nor use potions, scrolls, or wands that are not evocation. (So, no healing potions) Weave Master, allows all spells to be cast unlimited, but at the cost of a small- to large, cooldown as seen above. With a way to possibly lower said cooldown.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n The Wizard has no such changes, as only spells and feats themselves have been changed (Necromancy giving more undead. Others giving the ability to scry, or teleport, etc once per rest.) Only Epic Evocation or Epic Conjuration have any real term benefit (such as hellball or greater ruin doing massive amounts more damage than Original, or increased stronger summons) So, the Sorcerer could be a better alternative, but I want your opinion as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n I do want to say in order to cast spells the 'base' stats must be met. So, let's say you need 13 INT to cast a level 4 spell on a wizard. Your base needs to be 13, it cannot be 8 and then increased to 13 via items. I do, however, want the Rapier incorperated as well. One of the above would allow for a steady stream of spells, but only if Sorcerer is taken first.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Edit: Went to test and confirm True Flame cannot use any spells other than evocation, and no healing potions. However, they are able to utilize healing kits as\u00a0 a means for healing if need be.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

True, but all I was saying was it has keen on there. How far enchantments can go? I cannot say.<br/>\n<br/>\n 2. Wisdom is to balance it out. I'm not 100% worried about advantages or disadvantages. Strength can be increased via a gift to 14. That takes care of the 13+ requirement for the divine might, etc abilities. In term, a +1 to strength on each item brings it well beyond the 20 points you aimed for in the build. Without sacrificing natural points given to other aspects. Constitution could be higher I admit, but I've already figured I'm going to just weapon focus in Rapier, and focus on Spellcasting for the sorcerer the other amount of the way.<br/>\n<br/>\n 3. There is indeed great Synergy with a Paladin and Sorcerer. It works pretty well with a monk as well in which is how I got to those saves. With a favorable roll on IGMS, I could not reach its true potential. Casting IGMS on Arelith, is not really any better than ILMS since they limited the magical bolts per one person (10). You do potentially do slightly more damage, but the big change itself isn't noticeable without all the magical balls striking the enemy. (Though, I apologize, I thought maxamize spell wass better than Empowered, hence why I was thinking of changing it.)<br/>\n<br/>\n 4. Do I know how the attack role works? Somewhat. Threat Range: That was something new to me. I thank you for the lesson. It's definitely random when it comes to these things. You have your insane AB guys, your higher than puffy dragon AC guys, a bunch of mixtures on Arelith. (They're all mostly power builders though, so.. go figure xD)<br/>\n<br/>\n 5. Theoretically? Yes, you could do that. Realistically? No, I think you're missing the point. When I say +1 on strength, I mean a ring getting +1. Yes, when you add up all the items if they all have strength on it. It does indeed seem like a lot. Enchanting an item with more than 2 buffs (Stat, Skill, etc) without a 80-90% Chance of major failure (Gold loss, Heavy exp loss, etc) Not likely. Possible, but unlikely. Arelith is still pretty much a low magic realm. You don't just find magical items out in the world willy nilly like the OC, or some other persistent worlds. But, with risk comes ...semi-rewards. It does seem like a nightmare, but its still surprisingly balanced. Nobody's character will go without being put in the dirt more than a few times. You might be overthinking things, it's not all about balance, it's whether you have fun playing or not. ...Except you know, when DM's decide to spawn 10 Balors in the noob town for story purposes. Things get hectic pretty quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, thank you for your time. I enjoyed myself and even figured out how I want to build this Sorcerer.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
