HP.\u00a0 But still a much different build since he focuses on Discipline to go toe to toe with strength builds.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And then there is my own slew of Fighter/Rogue/CoT\u2019s: Death\u2019s Rival, The Last Great Bounty Hunter, and the Incredible Fighting Rogue of War, but they\u2019re all Dwarves, so\u2026 I won\u2019t bother posting links for those.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Builder\u2019s Commentary</span></strong><br/>\nWhile I hesitate to call anything the \u201cquintessential\u201d build of something, this is fairly close to being one to represent the halfling rogue warrior clan.\u00a0 There are many varied combinations of these classes \u2013 a testament to the versatility of this combo \u2013 but somehow this one manages to be different.\u00a0 Of course, when you play this game long enough at some point you feel like you\u2019re \u201cjumping the shark\u201d when building any kind of class combo anymore.\u00a0 Many (me included) will often argue the value and investment of something like Self Concealment V since it is such a huge investment \u2013 5 feats \u2013 and coming at the expense of other things that you would like to see your Rogue have (Epic Will, Slippery Mind, Epic Fort, Great Dex\u2019s, Improved Sneaks or Epic Skill Foci).\u00a0 Indeed, I remade this same character and removed the SC feats and achieved an unbuffed dualwielding AB of 44, which is outstanding for no WM or RDD levels while still retaining 24 Rogue levels.\u00a0 <br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nBut there is still something sexy about SC V.\u00a0 It\u2019s baked in.\u00a0 It\u2019s permanent.\u00a0 There\u2019s no mitigation for it (save Blindfighting).\u00a0 If the enemy\u2019s first attack is an IKD, and he lands the hit, Epic Dodge makes it miss.\u00a0 His second attack is now coming at 5 lower AB, which is like adding 5 to your AC.\u00a0 Assuming he can still land that, Self Concealment takes over and now his hit is half as likely to miss.\u00a0 Epic Dodge, coupled with high AC and SC feats, makes you nigh untouchable.\u00a0 <br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nKukri\u2019s were taken because they\u2019re far sexier than daggers, and they can be keened and have a higher crit range.\u00a0 However, Improved Crit is not taken because of the diminishing return on that investment.\u00a0 Still, you could drop Called Shot, or Iron Will, if you feel you must have it.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think it adds much in a build like this.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nI rarely take Called Shot in a non-archer build, but it works in this one.\u00a0 It\u2019s a nice tool to have for both ranged and melee tactics, especially of the enemy is either to large to knockdown or has immunity/discipline resistance.\u00a0 <br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nWhile I invested points in Discipline, you may find yourself not needing it and rely on Epic Dodge and Concealment (and KD Immunity) to avoid the best attack sequence from your enemies.\u00a0 If you\u2019re swarmed by more than two opponents with such attacks, you may reconsider that decision though.\u00a0 Just know that enemies with Disarm/Improved Disarm may have a leg up on you, especially if they\u2019re using medium or large weapons. <br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nSpellcraft was cross-classed (yes, you have that many skill points) to help out in the saves department (+4 extra against spells).<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nFinally, there is something satisfying in how well the build matures.\u00a0 It gradually and consistently becomes stronger, faster, better, and never seems to lack.\u00a0 In fact, there is a sweet spot from Level 27 to Level 33 where, in a span of 6 levels, he grabs Epic Dodge, Crippling Strike, EWF, EWS, Epic Prowess, and SC I and SC II.\u00a0 I do miss the days when one could take Epic Dodge at Level 21, but those days are gone.\u00a0 Level 27 is as early as one can get it, and really should be the target one shoots for when building an Epic Dodger.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

For a couple of months everyone's all hot on Bards, then all swoon for PMs, then the world goes weak-kneed for Druids, and so on. Perhaps one build catches the imagination and folk grab that spark and run in their own directions with it. It's all good - all classes (by and large - HS and PDK do tend to be the weird cousins in the corner most of the time, even though attempts are occasionally made to drag them out and join the party. And SD and Shifter can always be found in the kitchen bitching about the others) get their season in the sun.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

A few things I like that haven't been mentioned yet include how you used fighter and CoT pre-epic to transfer two bonus feats to epic levels, the lore / RP with the build is great as always and some nice analysis.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou mentioned HiPS, I am curious with this builds stealth power, if you were ever tempted to go Rogue / Fighter and swap CoT for a single cheese level of shadowdancer (SD), you can also end on a odd rogue level as well. Something like Rogue 25 / Fighter 14 / SD 1.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nYou'd lose +5 to saves, plus some fort and reflex saves, a little hp, have to take dodge and mobility, put one feat pre-epic to epic I guess for some sneak attack, more skill points and HiPS. Do think it would be equally as strong or it isn't worth it?</div></blockquote>\nHail Orion!\u00a0 Your comments are always welcome.\u00a0 In a way, without realizing (or maybe you did), you answered your own musings and ponderings.\u00a0 The FighterX/RogueX/SD1 has been done to death, even more so that the Ftr/Rogue/CoT combo.\u00a0 In fact, I think I even have a few still lingering around the ECB archives... the Zhentarim Field Agent comes to mind, though he is strength based.\u00a0 But certainly there are many others if you run a filtered search for them.\u00a0 But the Ftr/Rogue/SD really is a different build.\u00a0 You have to expend two feats pre-epic so you'll lose Called Shot and either Toughness or Iron Will, and then of course the big drop in saves.\u00a0 It would be more than 5 to each category.\u00a0 I really think that's a different type of build.\u00a0 Equally powerful, maybe even more deadly, but not as balanced, in my opinion.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nTo illustrate, here's a version of exactly what you described by Mithdradates, dubbed simply\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build117502.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Halfling</strong></a>.\u00a0 Here are his saves:<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Final Saves</span>\n<ul>\n<li>Fortitude 21</li>\n<li>Reflexes 31</li>\n<li>Will 17</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\nIt's one thing to have a 17 Will, which is horrendous, but Will has always been the achilles heel of the Rogue.\u00a0 But the 21 Fort is really low, too.\u00a0 Implosions, Petrifications, Dev Crit, etc.... HiPS is nice, but I don't think all Rogue-centric builds should require HiPS as a pre-req.\u00a0 I think it's a different build accompanied by a slightly different style.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's another:\u00a0\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build245086.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Sneaking Death</strong></a>\u00a0(who, incidentally, gets a lower AB with 1 weapon than the Gloom Razor gets with 2)<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Saves:</span>\n<ul>\n<li>Fort 21</li>\n<li>Reflex 33</li>\n<li>Will 17 (15 if Iron Will is not taken)</li>\n</ul>\n\nTo answer the question you didn't ask:\u00a0 Is there a quintessential version of a Halfling Ftr/Rogue/SD out there?\u00a0 Maybe.\u00a0 Maybe not.\u00a0 It may require more study.\u00a0 Does that answer your question?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I did, however, do the Rogue/Divine Champion/SD thing. It had Kukri, traps, ED and SCV. Along with UMD. It works well. The thing is, on a PvP server you won't miss weapon Spec that much. Laying out a field of traps, popping out of stealth behind all of them while firing your bow. When he clicks you he wades into a minefield, and then you unleash your kukris. Also, GD, carry a shield. Popping out an extra 7 AC when needed makes you virtually unhittable. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor old geezers like us, who did play ADnD, a fighter/thief is konda iconic and we'll always have fun with it. Glad to see at least a few gray-bearded men still hangs around. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's well thought out and powerful. Would I miss IC?

I pick them up, stare at them and think to myself.  Do I want to spend the time doing this?

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Well to each their own. I encourage keeping your mind open to new learning and experiences about craft trap.\u00a0<br/>\nAll three of you (GDL, Zanithar and Web) have seen my trapping in action.\u00a0<br/>\nOne of Zanithar's characters nearly died to my minor electrical traps after I dirtnapped (for another reason).\u00a0<br/>\nIt helps solving tricky low pre-epic problems if done well.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIts less about whether craft trap is good / bad, its more about quality of life and making the most of your rogue.<br/>\nThe skill is there, its like whether you want to play that piano or guitar with 9 fingers or 10.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will want lots of components. One component is not enough. More like 10-25 components for minor traps. The more the better.<br/>\nYou can get that in the environment you play in.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou don't need huge investments in the skill. You should view 1 rank in the skill as large increase in your ability to make traps.\u00a0<br/>\nAs mentioned there is a 10% chance of component loss if you fail to make a trap.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nWith zero ranks in craft trap-&gt;<br/>\nInt 14 = modified craft trap 2 = 10% chance of making a DC 20 minor fire trap, 90% chance of failure, 9% chance of component loss. -&gt; 1 component = half a trap<br/>\nDrink a fox's cunning -&gt; modified craft trap 4 = 20% chance of making same fire trap, 80% failure, 8% component loss -&gt; 1 component = 2/3rd a trap<br/>\nEquip craft trap +5 ring &amp; fox's = modified craft trap 9 = 45% chance of making same trap, 55% failure, 5.5% component loss -&gt; 1 component = 90% of a trap<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you add like a few ranks it just makes life a bit easier to make those minor traps during those harder low levels.\u00a0<br/>\nIts kind of like lore and appraise, you dont need those points but it helps with quality of life low pre-epic, then when you get to high pre-epic they arent really needed anymore.<br/>\nIf you have the components just make em.<br/>\n<br/>\n1 minor trap is a waste of time especially if its a frost trap or something garbage like that.\u00a0<br/>\n10-20 minor traps (200-400 damage) packs a punch and worth your effort.<br/>\n25-30 minor traps (500-600 damage) should be enough to kill early pre-epic non-evasion bosses without getting your hands dirty at all.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain you want lots of components.\u00a0<br/>\nFire, electrical for most things. Holy for undead. Ignore others to start off with, waste of your time.<br/>\nAll you got to remember for a beginner like me.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually stop making traps after minors. By the time I could use bigger traps, my character can do bigger and better things, like you have :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a lot of cross-pollenation of skills and learning when in a party. We all have different ideas and ways of solving problems I'd encourage players to not go too heavy down the solo path and join up with others occasionally, who knows, you might learn something from them, and in my case, this craft trap concept was introduced to me by Zelcandra and I refined it in my own way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry GDL not trying to hijack your thread.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You'll lose 5 AB and 6 damage. The 5 AB consists of not taking a focus or epic focus in the weapon, costing you a combined -3; then, as the whip is a small weapon and this is a halfling, you'll get a further -2 penalty for dual-wielding it (you need tiny weapons for hins). The damage disappears because you can't take a specialization (-2) or its epic brother (a further -4) in it either. None of which is good.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, dropping fighter just makes it worse. To start with, you need a BAB of +7 before you can take CoT, which means your first 9 levels would have to be rogue, making early levelling much tougher. Then, you lose a bonus feat: fighter gets them at level 1, 2, 4, 6; CoT at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. Weapon specialization (and therefore EWS) also has to fall, as only fighter can take it, so not only do you gimp the whip in your main hand, but now also your kukri in your off hand. Again, you'd have to delay when you take your bonus feats (making early levelling even harder) possibly into epic levels, which knackers epic feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll leave it there, at least for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might look kewl, but kewl and dead is still dead.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry again!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

We allow the OP to post their desired build, but with a disclaimer somewhere that says that this build will only function in worlds that have the CEP weapons patch updated. If that's not your case, just pick a different weapon. I think that's a decent compromise.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If a build is optimized for a specific environment where there are custom modifications to the Vanilla NWN rules, then there needs to be a mention somewhere. Imagine, for example, that an Arelith builder decides to make an Assassin, but there, Assassins get HiPS at some point (don't remember exactly where). Then, someone who isn't very experienced reads the build, where the OP mentions some tactics that include HiPS, gets excited, and decides to give it a go in SoU + HotU, only to find out, after 20+ levels, that they don't get HiPS without SD levels. All of that because the guy neglected to mention that the build was made specifically for Arelith, where Assassins get HiPS.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the kind of situation we're trying to avoid.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
