The Vicar needs no sound.\u00a0 He can now just pummel the defenseless caster or drop an Implosion that he has no chance of succeeding a save, or crisscross the caster with Empower Blade Barriers.\u00a0 For party play, it\u2019s even more wicked to cast the Silence on a party member (speedy Monk being ideal) and have them rush the caster(s) to muffle their mouths while the Vicar unleashes holy hell on the unsuspecting casters.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nThe Vicar is further enhanced by high Spot and Listen skills, by a wide range of powerful and undispellable Cleric Buffs, and can maintain a high Zen Armor Class by wearing only robes and a high wisdom.\u00a0 Curse Songs and Wounding Whispers will be useless against his Silence and Extended Silence (Void Mode).\u00a0 I chose not to select any Epic Spells or Armor Skin.\u00a0 I found Great Wisdoms added more value and synergy.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nIn my design and testing, I tried a number of combinations \u2013 a more melee focused version, a hybrid Rogue/CoT, and then finally the near pure caster.\u00a0 Pound for pound, the near pure seemed to be the best.\u00a0 It was just too strong.\u00a0 The melee and hybrids tried to be too many things and in the end weren\u2019t as effective. While other builds aim to be Spell-proof against casters, this build takes aim at casters in a different way\u2014if they can\u2019t cast a spell, you are, in effect, spell proof.\u00a0 <br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nAdditionally, in my original prototype I took all Monk levels in Epic in order to preserve 1 BAB (15 vs 14).\u00a0 I think it\u2019s just the warrior streak in me that makes me that way, but as I considered it more during playtesting, I moved 2 Monk levels to pre-epic.\u00a0 While I lost 1 BAB (<em>Disclaimer, this is not a melee build so there is little value in a BAB point</em>), I gained +3 to saves to boost his sluggish Reflex and Fort, as well as getting more mileage out of Evasion, Monk Wisdom AC, Monk attack schedule and Deflect Arrow.\u00a0 <br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nOn a side note, the Vicar does receive 4 Stunning Fists a day whose DCs are, when Wisdom is maxed, 49.\u00a0 However Stunning Fist has been nerfed in EE (1 Round duration) and using this ability in the above build is highly situational and not recommended for home use. But it\u2019s there if you like to play with your prey.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nRegarding Domains, if you are in an environment where perma-haste is easily or even moderately accessible, the Travel Domain is superfluous.\u00a0 In that case I would suggest Animal (<em>for Empowered Cat\u2019s Grace and Improved Summons</em>), or Magic Domain for bonus spell slots from 1<sup>st</sup> through 5<sup>th</sup> <em>(and the Stoneskin is nice too!</em>) , or Knowledge for bonus spell slots 1<sup>st</sup>-4<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup>.\u00a0 If anyone wants to try this but you are limited by Domains and Racial choices, just let me know and I can rework a custom version.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Awesome idea GDL, I cannot recall anyone else doing such a build, so this is great to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am curious about the choice of ranger.<br/>\nI take it was for the bonus feat for GSF: Evocation, plus the ability to dump into detect etc<br/>\n<br/>\nI think if you are prepared to drop that bonus feat, then rogue or assassin would provide more, particularly with UMD.<br/>\nThis includes Mords, Time Stop scrolls, as well as wands of Lesser Spell Breach if you have access to this.\u00a0<br/>\nThe small amount of sneak attack combined with the high AB boosts of cleric and high number of attacks from Range or Monk UBAB is helpful as well particularly with lots of summons at your disposal.<br/>\nCleric 35 / Monk 3 / Rogue 2 (or Assassin 2) split if you want to keep the monk speed, or Cleric 35 / Monk 2 / Rogue or Assassin 3 to drop the monk speed for 2d6 sneak attack combined with 8 APR.<br/>\nAssassin 2 (compared with rogue 3) gets uncanny dodge but requires investment into hide/move silently and one to be evil.\u00a0<br/>\nI like a Cleric 35 / Monk 3 / Rogue 2 or Assassin 2 split personally.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's the only tweak I would suggest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am curious about the Greater Sanctuary and Set Trap interaction by the way. If one sets a trap under such said mage's feet with Greater Sanctuary active, say a nice juicy deadly electrical trap, does the trap going off break Greater Sanctuary? Food for thought. Something I might play test in the future.</div>"

Viceversa you can cast Silence and then a silent Globe (yep, using metamagic ).<br/>\nI would lose travel domain if Perma-haste is permitted, otherwise probably Trickery, but I grant you it's a painful pedigree.<br/>\nI love the fact that this build have 3 levels of monk for Monk's speed becouse you can chase (in silence) superfast enemies, but for the same reason i hate that this build doesn't have \"Use magic device\" to cast Expeditious retreat, or Mass Haste from scrolls</div>"
