Almost 20 years on from creation, I'm seeking opinions from the experts on this build and the combination in general.\u00a0 I know there are a lot of opinions around here :D<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nEltalstro</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hi eltalstro,<br/>\nThe build is far from optimised, e.g. Improved initiative should be swapped with something like Called Shot or Blind Fight, and it is not hard to add EWF and even EP if you are willing to start out with a higher dexterity. You will most probably not want the discipline skill because it is a dex'er, a ranged attacker and because you invest a lot to simply avoid being hit. One may also debate if not listen is better than spot or if you want them both.<br/>\nWhat I find most interesting is the discussion that follows the build. Is SC5 worth it/ is it the best way to achieve 50% concealment? Can you build with Rogue instead of SD? Will 50% concealment also protect against spells etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe combination of 50% concealment, ED and a high AC no doubt is very effective against physical attacks, an important reason why dexers become better in high magic environments. Another reason for that is high weapon enhancements that compensate for a lower strength\u00a0 based damage bonus.<br/>\nIn this particular build, you sacrifice 6 AA levels (3AB and 3 damage) compared to a build with SD 10 and ED alone.<br/>\nThe claim that concealment protects against magical attacks is not documented anywhere (as far as I can see), but it is not unreasonable to assume that it protects against magic that depends on a touch attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow can it be done with Rogue rather than SD? Indeed it can!<br/>\nAnd if you want to avoid the xp penalty that comes with the Bard/Rogue combo for elves, you simply build with Wizard. Here is an example:<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>\n\nSTR: 12\nCON: 10\nINT: 14\n\n02: Rogue(2): {Evasion}\n04: Rogue(4): DEX+1, (DEX=21)\n06: Rogue(6): Weapon Focus: Longbow\n08: Rogue(8): DEX+1, (DEX=22)\n10: Arcane Archer(1)\n12: Arcane Archer(3): DEX+1, Called Shot, (DEX=23)\n14: Arcane Archer(5)\n16: Arcane Archer(7): DEX+1, (DEX=24)\n18: Arcane Archer(9): Weapon Finesse\n20: Wizard(2): DEX+1, (DEX=25)\n22: Rogue(9)\n24: Rogue(11): DEX+1, Armor Skin, (DEX=26)\n26: Arcane Archer(12)\n28: Rogue(14): DEX+1, (DEX=27)\n30: Arcane Archer(14): Great Dexterity I, Great Dexterity II, (DEX=29)\n32: Rogue(15): DEX+1, (DEX=30)\n34: Arcane Archer(16)\n36: Arcane Archer(17): DEX+1, Self Concealment III, (DEX=31)\n38: Rogue(19): Self Concealment IV\n40: Arcane Archer(19): DEX+1, (DEX=32)\nHitpoints: 274\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +5, Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +4\nAB (max, naked): 39 (melee), 52 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Wizard(1)\n\nDisable Trap 34(38), Hide 43(54), Move Silently 42(53), Open Lock 11(22), Search 38(42), Set Trap 32(45), Spellcraft 23(25), Spot 43(44), Tumble 40(51), UMD 36(35)\n01: Disable Trap(4), Hide(4), Move Silently(4), Open Lock(4), Search(4), Set Trap(4), Spot(4), Tumble(4), Save(8), \n03: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(6), Save(6), \n05: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), Save(10), \n07: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), Save(16), \n09: Persuade( ), Spellcraft(8), Save(10), \n11: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Save(13), \n13: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Save(19), \n15: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Save(25), \n17: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Save(31), \n19: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Save(37), \n21: Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Spot(2), Save(26), \n23: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), UMD(15), \n25: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Set Trap(6), Spot(1), \n27: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(2), Set Trap(3), Spot(1), Tumble(5), \n29: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Save(3), \n31: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Save(9), \n33: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Spot(1), UMD(5), \n35: Disable Trap(4), Hide(1), Search(2), Set Trap(4), Spot(1), \n37: Disable Trap(9), Spot(1), Tumble(5), \n39: Hide(2), Move Silently(3), Spot(1), \n</details>\n\nEdit: Made some changes to the build included in the \"spoiler\"</div>",

      "content": "<div>I'm not sure whether SC5 <em>and</em> HiPs <em>and</em> ED isn't something of an overkill, and that any 2 of the 3 should do the job. I'd keep ED for True Seers and folk with a particularly high Spot skill (or when you dash in hasted to PBS an annoying mage to death by ignoring damage shields, etc) and go for either of the other 2. For this particular build, where you don't want to get involved in melee at all, I'd have thought HiPS should be enough (thus allowing for the 6 extra AA levels as Mick mentions), unless it has a \"cool-down\" element implemented. Mick's version (above) takes the opposite route, which seems to work fine - and you don't need Dodge and Mobility with it, so effectively you have 2 free feats to use, while the SD option will mean dipping out on one of Called Shot, Blind Fight, or Imp Crit. However, it opens up more options in epic levels. It's all a bit of a trade-off, as are so many things NwN-related.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",
