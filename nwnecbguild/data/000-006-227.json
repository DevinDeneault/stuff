      "content": "<div>Hello everyone. I've come back to playing NWN, after a seven-year hiatus, and found this guild a tremendous resource in crafting my ideal character. Thank you for all that you've made here!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my first attempt at a build. I've come up with what I think to be a good all-around build for playing PvM campaigns. Though I came up with the class/level spread on my own before beginning, a quick search found one very similar: Herbie Shimmer's excellent <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build202302.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PW Shifter (Druid 17 / Monk 6 / Shifter 17)</a> build. I thus used his and other builds, and of course the invaluable <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/a-complete-guide-to-the-basics-of-character-building-t515440.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Complete Guide to the Basics of Character Building</a> as a guide. My goal was to maximize options in role-playing through dialogue with NPCs (hence the emphasis on Persuasion), while allowing for a playable and enjoyable character with lots of versatility and power. Please let me know your thoughts on whether I have succeeded in this, or if you would recommend any improvements. Thanks in advance for your help!<br/>\n<br/>\n(Formatting and number-crunching courtesy of the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=other.detail&amp;id=856\"

      "content": "<div>Hey, man. <br/>\n<br/>\nNice build you have there. It's pretty solid, although tweakable if certain things are observed.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have anyone (even a henchman will do) who can help you past the first level? If so, the first available tweak is to start with Monk to get more skillpoints. Not VERY necessary, but the end result is more power at zero cost.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also swap Toughness for Blind Fight, as +1 HP per level is not nearly as useful as what Blind Fight gives you (negates bonuses when you're attacked by invisible characters or when you're blinded and lets you reroll the miss chance against concealed monsters).<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also say that you have NO physical stats, which is OK for Druids, but hampers some of the usefulness of some shifter shapes (such as Minotaur, which only overrides STR or Kobold Commando, which only overrides DEX). You should DEFINITELY include Weapon Finesse in there somewhere for your DEX shapes, such as the aforementioned Kobold and Air elemental (which has a very competitive AC throughout, even at 40). I would drop Improved Expertise or even Improved Critical for it. I think it's worth the investment. Improved Expertise might have some uses, but it's hard to imagine a world where just Expertise isn't enough for a Druid to walk around with.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally, I would swap Knockdown with Alertness and delay Shifter for 2 levels for 2 reasons:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- At Druid 5 you get the Bear Shape, which, combined with the Wisdom AC and Monk Attack Progression makes you a meleeing beast. Knockdown is the icing to the cake. At this level you will HARDLY EVER MISS a KD attempt because of the bear's high strength.<br/>\n<br/>\n2- It will allow you to get Druid 7 and therefore Stoneskin. I know it doesn't sound like much to have a 10/+5 DR, except for one detail you may be unaware of: Stoneskin cast on you makes is so that when you shift, your bear attack (claws) act as a +5 weapon for the purposes of breaching damage reduction. If you, for example, fight an Iron Golem (which has IIRC 30/+4 DR, or was it 40/+4?), you will do full damage to it if you cast Stoneskin on yourself and shift. Otherwise you'd barely scratch it for 4 damage each hit, or worse, 0 damage. This is also true for Gargoyles, wererats and many other creatures that have DR for weapons less than +5.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, very good, solid build. Cheers!<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Max,<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Monk, Druid, and Shifter are all 4+Int skill points.  No need to take monk at level one for skills.  Also shifted spells from the spellbook use the class level of the class you take at level one (unless you cast a quickslot from a spellbook).  Since he ends up with 17 druid and only 6 monk, it is far better to take druid at level one.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) The kobold form has weapon finesse.  I don't see the need for investing in this feat in general, as the air elemental seems to be the only one with significant gain with the next in line being the mindflayer.  However, in this build, both of these forms are not competitive (the mindflayer's abilities are nerfed from the standard creature and the elemental shape does not have enough levels for the improved forms).<br/>\n<br/>\nTo the OP<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Brew potion is powerful (1.69 implementation) as it allows you to buff while shifted if any of your defenses are dispelled.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) As Max said, take blind fight early.  It is great if blind or fighting against concealment.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Sorry, Whizard, you're correct. I was using Cleris-biased thinking when I suggested going Monk first. OOPS, my bad! I stand corrected. Don't do what I said, OP, I suck <br/>\n<br/>\nI think Finesse is better than Improved Expertise because the only thing you can use it for is to use breath weapons or special abilities with extra AC, and for that, IMO Expertise is enough. But that, i guess, depends on where you're playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

      "content": "<div>\"Playable\" vs. \"Optimized\"<br/>\n<br/>\n You can still get all the shapes you currently have selected EXCEPT epic humanoid by adding an additional monk level as the late tumble dump.\u00a0 The last shifter bonus is at Shf 16. TBH, once you have access to undead and outsider, more than likely the normal commando will be adequate for the \"special\" situations.\u00a0 Since you haven't invested at all in stealth, the commando's HiPS won't work very reliably anyway.\u00a0 The main benefit in that extra monk level is that you can get KD/IKD in early epic so can free up the redundant feat chosen at Lvl 9.\u00a0\u00a0 At the very next level (10), minotaur gets KD for free.\u00a0 All the armed shapes have weapon merge so shapes will always be better in melee than the native human form.<br/>\n<br/>\n BTW, <em>Wholeness of Body</em> works while shifted. <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/6.gif\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n Skill tweaks briefly...<br/>\n No value in Tumble over 40 ranks.\u00a0 The DC is static at 14 and even with full plate/tower a toon with Tumble 40 will win every tumble check.\u00a0 A modified Tumble rating of 25 is sufficient to achieve 100% success wearing any armor/shield config.<br/>\n Spellcraft of 38, modified 40 by INT will still give the same save boost vs. spells (+8).<br/>\n So you have 7 more points to allocate however you see fit with no side effects.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for using DR buffs like Stoneskin for all shapes that use creature weapons... Max is spot on.<br/>\n<br/>\n However, keep in mind that your druid buffs will be relatively easy to dispel (you'll be able to shrug off lesser dispels but not much more).\u00a0 The shapes themselves cannot be dispelled, but the buffs can.\u00a0 So be prepared to re-morph in that event.\u00a0 Learn all the DR bonuses on your unarmed shapes because some have +1 DR and others even higher so the claw/bite enhancement will penetrate an equal DR without timing out or getting dispelled like a buff can.\u00a0 Only the dragon's +6 DR surpasses the Stoneskin buff.<br/>\n<br/>\n Finally, if you were to swap Blind Fight for the KD taken at Level 9, Epic Prowess at 39 would boost the AB of every shape, the only AB boost feat that works with creature weapons.</div>"
