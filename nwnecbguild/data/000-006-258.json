      "content": "<div>There isn't really much to say about this build, at it's basics is an undispellable spellsword with dragonic enhancements to his physical abilities and full warrior abilities. First one i believe to present this mixture of classes in the old ecb was dmuzzy with his \"Might and Magic\" build, then Max improved considerably on the initial build with his \"Dragonic Arcanist\". From that point and on little could be done to improve again, so my spellsword i would say isn't better or worse than Max's, it is just different and to that helped a lot that i had a theme to work upon. For those that did not already catch the reference to \"The Wheel of Time\" books, this is Rand Al' Thor (the child of the prophecy destinied to face off the Dark One at the end of time) wielding Kalandor - his mighty Crystal Greatsword.

You will loose Taughness but your HP's will remain the same. I could not make Rand Al' Thor a Dwarf to begin with though, there are some limits that even I, cannot cross.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Devastating Critical Version</strong>:<br/>\nYou can make this build into a Devastating Critical spellsword quite easily and this was indeed my initial preference. I left it aside to take some (very) useful combat feats and because few PW's still allow this feat without severely hindering it, but if your preferances are the same as mine and you would like to have \"The Dragon Reborn\" at it's original power, especially if you consider that the DC is quite high to begin with then here is what you will do. Replace <em>Improve Knockdown</em>, <em>Toughness</em>, <em>Blind Fight</em> and <em>two </em>of the <em>Great Strength</em> feats with: <em>Power attack</em>, <em>Cleave</em>, <em>Great Cleave</em>, <em>Overwhelming </em>and <em>Devastating</em> <em>Critical </em>and there you have it! The DC for that will be a very solid 44/ 50 with Maxed out Strength, now <strong>this is the real </strong>Dragon Reborn!<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit by Mick Dagger: *Swapped feats to make build legal (IKD cannot come on level 9 when BAB is +4), corrected the number of skill points from 260 to 291 and added a suggested skills schedule.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Nice build looks solid. Only thing I might do is shuffle the first few feats around to get blindfight earlier, but that is just a preference of mine with melee builds and it seems that's what this guy would be doing for the first half of his existenceor so, so I'd get it sooner(horrible run on sentence there ugh).  O and btw I wouldn't have been able to make him a dwarf either, I think I've read all but 1 or 2 books in that series good reading.</div>"

      "content": "<div>This is a great spellsword build. I like the way you get AB +41 from a BAB of 22. Bard and a high intelligence\u00a0secure the essential skills, and you get skill dumps at fairly regular intervals. You get most of your spell related feats from wizard bonus feats and\u00a0can build an enormous strength.<br/>\n Even so, a\u00a0viable tweak would be to\u00a0settle for AB +40 and take Armor skin and EMA rather than Great strength 3 and 4.<br/>\n I'm a big fan of the SP feats when caster class levels dip below 30, and Bigby VI that you can still at lvl 25 is better than IKD. But\u00a0swapping those feats\u00a0means late blooming and shifting focus more towards the caster part of the build. And spamming Bigbys is perhaps more for sorcerers than wizards...

      "content": "<div>@ Dark Knight,<br/>\n You can certainly swap places between \"heavy armour\" and \"blind fighting\" for sure if you want it, there is room for that. I know many people who like to get \"blind fighting\" as early as possible and you can certainly do that here as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Empyre,<br/>\n I am a big fan of \"blind fightning\" as well and i have played builds that have it or not (great smiters for example can rarely afford it), but one must consider when it is really useful. In 9 out of 10 cases you will need \"bllind fightning\" against strong opponents, right? So, here comes this build and says to you \"<em> i don't care about strong opponents </em>\" because if i see one i will just use my spells and get rid of him. See tough opponent with concealment effects? Use bigby's VI OR VII and he is a sitting duck ready to be slain effortlessly, or simply blast him out of existance with Isack's storms, problem solved. So, while \"blind fighting\" is a really nice feat to have in most builds, is\u00a0 nowhere of the same importance for \" The Dragon Reborn\".<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Mick,<br/>\n We are certainly of the same thought, your suggestion about getting \"greater spell penetration\" is very good and myself i only skip it because i had a certain (strong martial) theme in mind when i made this build. You sure have \"Mord's\" to lower SR by 10, when it matters but having more penetration with your spells is always useful, so this is a very valid suggestion and in PW's that you need it - i certainly advice to swap any two pre - epic feats in order to get them.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thank you all for your input and constructive criticism gents, that was a great feedback.<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>Aye, with the spell penentration feats and Mord's you can effectively have a 41-60 penetration when you need it. Another powerful AoE de-buff spell is \" negative energy burst \", take a boss - any boss and cast Bigby's interposing hand (V) and Negative energy burst on it, he now has a total of (-13)! to all his attack rolls and he is effectively neutralized. The \" Negative energy burst \" spell only has a save for it's damage part but nothing on the strength-sap effect of it. As a general principle, the more powerful a spell-sword is the more spells he will have remaining for hard and boss fights, and this is about as powerful as you can get it to be.</div>"
