She has magic via UMD of course, wands for darkfire, improved invisibility, keen weapon etc are all very useful to almost every fighter that isn't already a cleric hybrid &amp; she can use them as well as anybody else. There was a revolution back in the day, I am talking about 2005 here (Neverwinter Nights history) when Ralkain posted a build called \"The Pale Drake\" in the legacy ECB forums &amp; proved that this kind of build is so much tougher than a dwarven defender exactly because enemies can't ever hope to crit her or reliably hit her. That was an Elf &amp; ended at 36 strength &amp; had a rapier. It was a prototype of sorts. I took this and improved it by a lot &amp; this was one of my first builds when I entered the ECB.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I forgot to add her EMA ability (that lasts all day) when I was making the calculations for your server. <br/>\nHer true AC: 47 (base w/shield) +10 (Armour) +10 (Shield) +10 (Amulet) +10 (Ring) +10 (Boots) +4 (Haste) +5 (EMA) +1 (Mage armour, stacks w/EMA)= 107 AC.<br/>\nAnd then she has Epic Warding shield for 1000 Dmg absorption.

I'm probably only gonna hit on crit anyway, so I might as well maximize my AC. Only thing I couldn't make myself do, was go Shield/Warhammer, which would have been better, but... The scythe is so much cooler. Oh, well. That decision cost me 9AC in return for slightly better crit and coolness.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Bard(5), Pale Master(20), Red Dragon Disciple(15), Human\nSTR: 18 (40)\nCON: 12 (14)\nINT: 12 (14)\n\n01: Bard(1): Blind Fight, Armor Proficiency Heavy\n03: Bard(3): Weapon Proficiency Exotic\n05: Pale Master(2)\n07: Red Dragon Disciple(2): (STR=21)\n09: Red Dragon Disciple(4): Power Attack, (STR=24)\n11: Red Dragon Disciple(6)\n13: Red Dragon Disciple(8)\n15: Red Dragon Disciple(10): Cleave, {Darkvision}, (STR=29), (CHA=14)\n17: Pale Master(4)\n19: Pale Master(6)\n21: Pale Master(7): Epic Weapon Focus: Scythe\n23: Pale Master(9)\n25: Pale Master(11)\n27: Pale Master(13): Devastating Critical: Scythe, Epic Energy Resistance: Sonic I\n29: Pale Master(15)\n31: Red Dragon Disciple(11)\n33: Red Dragon Disciple(13): Great Strength II, (STR=36)\n35: Red Dragon Disciple(15)\n37: Pale Master(18)\n39: Pale Master(20): Great Strength IV, (STR=39)\n\nSkillpoints: 214\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9\nAB (max, naked): 41 (melee), 23 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Bard(2)\n</details></div>"

Honestly, at first I was excited about getting started on the Pale Master so quickly, then I started to hate that class as my AB lagged. Overall this build has great defense and damage but it takes a while to catch up on AB...and until you get 10 levels of PM, a single crit takes you down thanks to the low HP. As a high level character, this build rocks. Getting there is a grind.</div>"
