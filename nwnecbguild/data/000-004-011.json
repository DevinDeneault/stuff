Her attack penetrates stoneskins and similar magical defences. <br/>\nShe is not afraid of going toe to toe with her enemies. She taunts them so they expose their weaknesses when they come at her, and avoids most attacks with her highly dexterous moves.<br/>\nShe knows how to use magic both to enhance her archery skills and her melee weapon, and to defend herself from harm. She knows several attack spells, and can cast fireballs from spells and with enchanted arrows.<br/>\nShe runs faster than most, and can use magic to move even faster. She can also use spells to trap or slow down her prey. <br/>\nShe also uses ordinary traps as a weapon. <br/>\nShe can pick simple locks and has spells to open the tougher ones.<br/>\nShe has also a little pixie-friend that can help her with difficult locks and help detect and disarm traps.<br/>\nSometimes she uses her magic to transform into a pixie herself and plays games with her little friend.<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbarian(3), Wizard(8), Arcane Archer(9), Elf<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 1-20 PvM <br/>\nBest in low magic environments, but works well in mid magic mods as well<br/>\nAlignment: Any non-lawful<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 13<br/>\nDEX: 19 (24)<br/>\nCON: 12<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Barbarian(1): Point Blank Shot<br/>\n02: Wizard(1): (School: Illusion), {Scribe Scroll}<br/>\n03: Wizard(2): Rapid Shot<br/>\n04: Wizard(3): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br/>\n05: Wizard(4)<br/>\n06: Wizard(5): Weapon Focus: Longbow, Extend Spell<br/>\n07: Wizard(6)<br/>\n08: Wizard(7): DEX+1, (DEX=21)<br/>\n09: Barbarian(2): Weapon Finesse, {Uncanny Dodge I}<br/>\n10: Wizard(8)<br/>\n11: Arcane Archer(1)<br/>\n12: Arcane Archer(2): DEX+1, Expertise, (DEX=22)<br/>\n13: Arcane Archer(3)<br/>\n14: Arcane Archer(4)<br/>\n15: Arcane Archer(5): Improved Critical: Longbow<br/>\n16: Arcane Archer(6): DEX+1, (DEX=23)<br/>\n17: Arcane Archer(7)<br/>\n18: Arcane Archer(8): Blind Fight or Called Shot<br/>\n19: Arcane Archer(9)<br/>\n20: Barbarian(3): DEX+1, (DEX=24)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 160<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 12/9/16<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +3, Mind Effects: +2<br/>\nBAB: 16<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 23 (melee), 29 (ranged)<br/>\nTaunt: +6 AB<br/>\nAC (naked/ padded armor &amp; shield): 19/23<br/>\nExpertise: +5 AC<br/>\nSpell Casting: Wizard level 0-4 spells - 5, 6, 5, 4 and 3 slots resp.<br/>\n<br/>\nSkillpoints: 122<br/>\nConcentration 13(14), Disable Trap 1(3), Discipline 23(24), Open Lock 1(8), Set Trap 3(10), Spellcraft 13(15), Spot 22(23), Taunt 21(20), Tumble 10(17)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Discipline(4), Open Lock(1), Taunt(4), Tumble(2), Save(10), <br/>\n02: Concentration(5), Spellcraft(5), Save(4), <br/>\n03: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(4), <br/>\n04: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(6), <br/>\n05: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(6), <br/>\n06: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(8), <br/>\n07: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(8), <br/>\n08: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(10), <br/>\n09: Discipline(8), Taunt(8), <br/>\n10: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(2), <br/>\n11: Spot(4), Tumble(1), <br/>\n12: Spot(6), <br/>\n13: Spot(4), Tumble(1), <br/>\n14: Disable trap(1), Set Trap(1), Tumble(1), <br/>\n15: Set Trap(1), Spot(2), Tumble(1), <br/>\n16: Set Trap(1), Spot(2), Save(2), <br/>\n17: Spot(2), Tumble(1), Save(4), <br/>\n18: Spot(1), Save(9), <br/>\n19: Spot(1), Save(14), <br/>\n20: Discipline(11), Taunt(9), <br/>\n<br/>\nStrengths: Highly versatile character with a strong Ranged AB. With EA-V she does not depend on her own spells to kill mages.<br/>\nShe can also handle melee really well buffed with Stoneskin, Improved invisibility and extended Haste while taking advantage of the Taunt/ Expertise combination.<br/>\nWhen she scribes scrolls of Flame weapon and GMW, she gets spells with a caster level higher than her own for +5 enchantment and 11-14 fire damage. Rage will also give a short boost to the damage.<br/>\nWeaknesses: <br/>\nLow hitpoints and a low will save, but she can cover that with defensive spells. <br/>\nShe is susceptible to dispels with only eight caster levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: Added Disable Trap<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

This means that you can tweak the build in different directions.<br/>\nIf you play in a party, you will probably not need Expertise. <br/>\nIf you solo, you can play \"run n'gun\", and also use Called shot, and even traps and spells to debuff and slow your targets. <br/>\nStealth is also possible. I have not taken stealth skills here, but they are there for you to pick if you are willing to drop something else.<br/>\nChoosing Expertise is for going melee when you get tired of running from mobs and lesser bosses, or if you get cornered. Expertise let you last a while even if your buffs get dispelled. Melee is a serious back up plan, even if it's not a #1 priority. Note that there is no melee weapon focus.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
