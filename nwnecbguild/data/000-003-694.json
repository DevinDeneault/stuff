Enchant arrow 11 (+11 dmg / hit)<br/>\nBase 520hp.<br/>\nFort 29(33), Reflex 31(35) + Evasion/IE, Will 17(23) - Saves vs spells are in () Brackets<br/>\nMax Stealth/Spot, UMD 30 [has wizard in the build], Tumble 40, Spellcraft 20, Set Trap 15, Search etc.<br/>\nDex AC is protected by uncanny dodge.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDR I - EDR III between level 27 and 33.<br/>\nEpic Dodge at level 36.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Will save looks bad but with save 23 against spells and slippery mind it might be ok.<br/>\nOne will want prot v evil / clarity potions / lesser mind blank / mind blank though.<br/>\nGreater Dispelling and Mords is going to be tricky to handle, the best solution I think is to just have clarity pots on the quickbar.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Fort save is was troublesome to me. To kill this guy I am thinking -&gt; dev crit / implosion. This is why I prioritised Epic Fortitude over Epic Prowess.<br/>\nOne will want to cap cons + equip fortitude boosting gear to try and ensure he can tank that stuff. With +6 from cons and +5 fort items the fort save the Fort save hits 40(44), meaning anyone with Dev Crit DC 41 he will need to roll a 1 to fail such a roll, and he is difficult to implode.\u00a0<br/>\nEpic Fortitude comes late, but it is difficult to fit this in earlier with the EDR III + Epic Dodge I wanted to fit in beforehand.<br/>\n<br/>\nKnockdown immunity boots/items will be desired if you truly want to tank to protect dodge/tumble AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nMages will always be a problem of course. I am tempted to drop Rapid Shot or Called Shot for Knockdown, but the melee AB is only 38.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway now that this has been re-designed this looks much nicer to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nAppreciate suggestions/comments with the redesigned build.\u00a0<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Rogue(16), Wizard(2), Arcane Archer(22), Elf\nSTR: 10\nCON: 14 (22)\nINT: 10\n\n01: Rogue(1): Point Blank Shot\n03: Rogue(3): Weapon Finesse, {Uncanny Dodge I}\n05: Rogue(5)\n07: Rogue(7)\n09: Wizard(1): Blind Fight, {Scribe Scroll}\n11: Arcane Archer(2)\n13: Arcane Archer(4)\n15: Arcane Archer(6): Weapon Focus: Rapier\n17: Arcane Archer(8)\n19: Arcane Archer(10)\n21: Arcane Archer(11): Epic Weapon Focus: Rapier\n23: Rogue(10): Improved Evasion\n25: Arcane Archer(13)\n27: Arcane Archer(15): Epic Damage Reduction I\n29: Arcane Archer(16)\n31: Arcane Archer(18): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=23)\n33: Rogue(12): Epic Damage Reduction III\n35: Arcane Archer(21)\n37: Arcane Archer(22): Great Dexterity III, (DEX=26)\n39: Rogue(15): Epic Fortitude\n\nSkillpoints: 244\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +4, Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +3\nAB (max, naked): 38 (melee), 47 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Wizard(0)\n\n\n01: Disable Trap(1), Hide(4), Move Silently(4), Open Lock(1), Search(4), Set Trap(1), Spot(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(5),\u00a0\n03: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(9),\u00a0\n05: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(13),\u00a0\n07: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(19),\u00a0\n09: Spellcraft(12), Save(12),\u00a0\n11: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(15),\u00a0\n13: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(19),\u00a0\n15: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(23),\u00a0\n17: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(27),\u00a0\n19: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(31),\u00a0\n21: Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Spot(2), Save(23),\u00a0\n23: Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Spot(2), UMD(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n25: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Save(3),\u00a0\n27: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n29: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(2),\u00a0\n31: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Save(2),\u00a0\n33: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(3), Spot(1), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n35: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(2),\u00a0\n37: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(2),\u00a0\n39: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(2), Set Trap(3), Spot(1),\u00a0</details>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Original post:</strong><br/>\nThis is an elven rogue arcane archer that attempts to be useful in melee and very powerful at range.<br/>\n<br/>\nElf for keen senses, bonuses to detection and dexterity.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nRogue 13 for Uncanny Dodge, Evasion, Epic Dodge, 7d6 sneak attack and great skills.<br/>\nArcane archer 25 for Enchant Arrow XIII and a full BAB class pre-epic.<br/>\nWizard 2 for a few useful level 1 spells and to qualify for AA without exp penalties as an elf.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is feat starved without Fighter or Champion of Torm, but I manage my best, and Rogue is necessary for Uncanny Dodge (other choices would be Barbarian, Assassin or Shadowdancer, Rogue appeared to be the best here).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nMelee Base AB is 40 which is decent considering 15 levels of non-combat classes and no melee weapon foci.\u00a0<br/>\nUseful melee feats include Weapon Finesse, Knockdown, Blind Fight, Called Shot, Toughness, Great Dexterity VII and Epic Dodge.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nRanged Base AB is 54, which is more than enough.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I typically go with the idea that going deep AA allows you some flexibility in other areas that no other class/feat allows.  Meaning you can play a 13 Dex archer using a longbow.  However you could just as easily play a 3 Bard / 24 cleric /13 AA netting +6/+6 archery. Which, admittedly on a cleric is not quite as useful as other classes but still is useful. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do find however, that partial AA builds lack the full power that min/max AA offers.  A 10 Dex archer with 47 AB and DevCrit for ranged and melee is amazing.  I shelved my Ba/RDD/AA and went with your build instead ... with elf mind you, not HElf :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
