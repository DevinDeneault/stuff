      "content": "<div>Thanks for taking the time to read through the draft and I didn't know about the standard format, thanks for educating me, I will re-write it once I edit the post.<br/>\n<br/>\nI forgot about skill focus: perform :) Good suggestion. It would allow perform to hit 55 modified for an extra bard song lvl. As a strong musical performer he/she must do that. I will miss you my good friend Improved Disarm (but it is ambitious to fit it into a non-fighter/CoT build). Lingering song is good too. Takes a while before lasting inspiration.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood suggestion to drop Epic Will and shift ESF: Listen to 40, I think I took it for the lols more than anything, but it is obtained so late it doesnt really matter\u00a0<br/>\nI have decided to try to have a Str modifer which is even in my two handed builds, its just mildly more efficient (ie Str modified 1 = +1 dmg. Str modifier 2 = +3dmg)<br/>\nI could make space for either Epic Prowess or Armor Skin. I like Armor Skin more because of all the AB buffs and AC lowering available in the build.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore HP + More AC = More Chop with Big Axe and More Singing Before Drink Health Potion<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Edit:</strong>\u00a0Edited most of Empyre65's suggestions into the main post. I dropped improved critical for a better bard song</div>"

Obviously GDL's build will have a <strong>much longer</strong> duration silence aura (the scroll is only 3 rounds, same as a wand)<br/>\nHere I charge in to fight a difficult cleric boss for our level who can't cast any spells whilst that radius is active, and pretty much annhilate him with my greataxe before my monk teammate arrives.<br/>\nI apologise that I didn't involve my monk teammate in the fight but things could have turned nasty if he did get a few spells off...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/202002/10759084_25dbd56470deed33325491e7809a6cfa_t.jpg\"/>And here we are, sailing off to Greyhawk city, to sell a pile of loot gained on our adventures... happy days...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne final small comment - early game leveling should be:<br/>\nBarbarian (4 levels) plus Bard level at either level 4 or 5.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimply because this allows a skill dump into UMD to get it to 5, allowing more spellcasting / equipping items.\u00a0<br/>\nAs discussed rage x2/day + bard song is a great situational boost early on, when the cap cannot be reached easily, but rage will become less useful even detrimental mid to late epic.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway hope you enjoyed reading this post, thanks as always for suggestions</div>"

It was just too much for my brain. In the end I settled for a great very tanky half-orc warrior with an amazing song, UMD to cover some gaps and just dumped Cha to make this character a 3 stat dependant build (Str, Cons, Int), rather than a 4 stat dependant build (Str/Cons/Int/Cha) with two stats having penalties.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe if you want bardic spellcasting I think human is better which will do this better than a half-orc, including giving the Vicar of the Void a run for its money as a silence aura slayer :)</div>"

The build I concocted is on page 2, but some of the discussion might be of interest to you. The build differs from yours in several aspects - uses CoT rather than RDD; is human; makes more use of Barb (essentially swapping Terrifying Rage for Lasting Inspiration) but still hits the Bard 16 sweet spot. Of course, if it's of no interest, please disregard this...<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/maybe-i-m-just-plain-outta-my-head-t2355054.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Champion of Gwynharwyf</a></div>",
