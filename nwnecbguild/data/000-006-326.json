      "content": "<div>A rework of <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build168701.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this build</a>. Two versions are here published, one working on earlier offense maturity and the other on earlier defense. It's a straightforward crit immune dev critter with epic spells and excellent AC complemented by umd, taunt and trap skills. EMA is a great spell to have, but EW can be swapped out for another epic spell of the player's preference given its short duration. Greater Ruin can be a fancy final blow and Hellball a good way to hit a crowd; where epic summons have been improved also Mummy Dust and Dragon Knight might be solid options. Going for other epic spells but EW frees up some skillpoints for perform and the 3rd lvl bard song (4x/day).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>******************************</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;line-height:normal\"><strong>DEATHKISS - FIGHTER(20),

Dev crit with a high DC combined with dev crit immunity will make you survive most dev crit duels. The base AB is fair, but you want as high AB as possible to confirm crit threats. Taunt and UMD will assist you with that. The trap skill is just icing on the cake.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat melee weapon do you have in mind?

That build has DR from Dwarven Defender already, which is essentially a defensive property, so taking EDR sooner means the difference between taking a little damage every hit and none whatsoever unless you receive a Critical Hit. In that case I prioritized defense, but any other situation, I'm with ya! They can't hurt you if they're dead!<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"
