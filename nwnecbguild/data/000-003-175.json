      "content": "<div>I'm a forum virgin, so please be gentle. I've gone through the Original Campaign, Shadows of Undrentide and Hordes of the Underdark as a 'pure' human monk with Linu in tow. I've tinkered around with dual-weapon builds - again as a human. I've also just completed the threesome solo as a Dwarven Defender/Weapon Master/Fighter thanks to one of the builds I found on here (which was particularly banging and dwarfy, btw, thanks!). I know this sounds like sacrilege, but I'm not a magic afficiando in NWN: it takes too much time, ink, and sobriety - ditto ranged weapons (apart from the ink and sobriety, obvs). So I guess I'm a hack and slash sort o' guy. However...I'm an elf lover, so would really appreciate a hard-ass, melee-centric pointy-eared build - who is clearly both short-sighted (can't read spells) and long-sighted (can't shoot bows). Any thoughts?</div>",

      "content": "<div>Hi and welcome to the ECB Stagmeister,<br/>\n<br/>\n Before i start to assume things, i think it would be better if you just gave us a bit more information about your self and what you have played from NwN. Is the original trilogy of NwN modules the only one you have played? Have you ever played in a Persistent World? What kind of melee character you enjoy more?<br/>\n Do you know of Devastating Critical? How difficult did you find the original modules? Things like that so we can answer and build to your taste ;) But just to give you a little information here, the ECB builds are made mostly towards low-to-medium Persistent Worlds that are hard and usually use some sort of advanced A.I like the old Pausanias engine or the newer and evolved Tonyk's 1.08. If those names tell you nothing, don't worry is just one of the things that make your game more challenging and fun and they are included in most of the good PW's out there.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hello there, Valerfor, and many thanks for such a speedy response.<br/>\n<br/>\n I've just posted an introduction - presumably while you were posting your reply. In answer to your questions: yes, I've only played the original trilogy of NwN - I've played quite a lot of Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale. I'm a late acolyte to pc gaming, but I go back centuries in fantasy gaming - I even have a DM Guide from the first generation of D&amp;D. I'm aware of Devastating Critical, which sounds lovely, but haven't got there: Improved Critical, yes. I'm afraid I don't know about Persistent Worlds at all (my bad). Equally, the names you mention do indeed mean nowt to me - I slap a disc in my laptop, make sure it's patched appropriately and hit go, numpty that I am.<br/>\n<br/>\n Technical deficiencies aside, I'm a it of a traditionalist as far as melee characters go - Dwarves use axes and blunt heavy things, Halflings small pointy things, etc. However, I'm trying to do something different this time. I'm not saying I want an Elf halberdier, but it would be nice for once if one could do a decent dual-wield with something other than rapiers: flails/morning stars and hand axes/toffee hammers. It may sound perverse, but I'd like to run the campaign through solo (although I'll probably pick up Aribeth, Deekin - for the conversations - or Nytherra in HotU, and hopefully not have to kill them this time) as a strength-based, dual-wielding elf. Don't want much, do I? Cheers</div>",

      "content": "<div>Hail and well met! *waves*<br/>\n Did you say that you played the OC, SoU, and HotU with the same character? Both the OC and SoU are supposed to start at level 1, and HotU is for the character that finished SoU, not the OC.<br/>\n If you want to continue after the OC, you might like the Aribeth Redemption series, but be advised, it is a love story between\u00a0 the player character and Aribeth. You wll end up at about level 28, same as HotU.<br/>\n If you want to continue after HotU (or after Aribeth's Redemption), you might like the Sands of Fate series. These will take you all the way to level 40.<br/>\n Another campaign I highly recommend is the Aielund Saga, which will take you from level 1 to about level 36 or so.<br/>\n You should be able to find these modules at <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://neverwintervault.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://neverwintervault.org/</a><br/>\n<br/>\n For dual-wielding, the off-hand weapon needs to be small or tiny, or you will get a -2 penalty on your AB. To reduce the number of feats needed, we usually use the same weapon in both hands. I could make for you a dual Short Sword Elf Bard / Fighter / Red Dragon Disciple, if you like that idea.</div>",

      "content": "<div>Salutations, Empyre65.<br/>\n<br/>\n I did, indeed, play the same character through OC, SoU and HotU - which probably explains the drabness of SoU (not visually, natch): killing a dragon for 47xp seemed a tad astringent. However, I'm a great believer in character continuity, even though this can lead me to crossness - people not remembering me and suchlike disjunctions. Hence, the Aribeth Redemption series may well be one I'd like to take, as with your other suggestions, for which many thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n I understand the dual-wielding issue and am very grateful for your offer, but I do like the idea of one sharp and one blunt weapon (covering bases, as well as looking good), as well as spells still playing a large part in character development - I do tend to be a rush in and hit things before they get the chance to hit you back sort of player. If Bard/Fighter/RDD does that, aces!<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers</div>",

      "content": "<div>Oh man, you are like a blank Canvas ready to be painted to a masterpiece!<br/>\n<br/>\n If you show even remotely the same affection you did for Baldur's Gate, for Neverwinder Nights you are in for a treatment i promise you that. Neverwinder Nights is probably one of the most beloved rpg games ever created and it's fanbase is fanatically loyal to it, thus they have created over three thousand modules for the game, making it almost limitless in scope. You will probably hear a lot of things suggested from us on these forums and understandingly not all of them will make sense to you at the beginning but be patient and ask and you will be rewarded. If you don't know or have doubts about something then ask freely, we are more than happy to share our knowledge with you. At this point i don't even know if you do know, how to install a module or how to join a Persistent World so i will cut on the overload of information that i am ready to impart on you and talk about two things only, the second one being your build, but the first one...<br/>\n<br/>\n 1st) Most important thing you have to experience about Neverwinder Nights is to join a Persistent World. Seriously, join a Persistent World if you haven't done so already. The Original Trilogy and all the additional (and vastly superior) modules that we are going to suggest to you over time will be always there as long as your hard drive exists and you can play them solo or with friends (LAN) whenever you want but after a decade of furious action the online community is starting to decline already. So, jump over there while you can and join a good Persistent World and experience what is like to have actual people in your team, adventure together and defeat all kinds of foes the Persistent World has to offer. It is totally free, no montly fees or whatever, they have Dungeon Masters online who interact with you real time and shape your adventures, you can drink in taverns with your team and joke about, share treasure, do almost anything, man is f a n t a s t i c !<br/>\n<br/>\n 2nd) Alrighty, about your build i would almost echo Empyre's suggestions but... this is the Original Trilogy right? And i pressume with no additional Haks or whatever like Tonyk's A.I or anything else, so anything works. You don't even need a power build for that, a naked character with one of Rizolvir's weapons could solo Mephisto with ease. You can even take a Cloak that makes you effectively immune to hostile magic and a Breastplate that makes you immune to Sneak attacks as well. Even as early as the first module (O.C) you can have a belt that makes all enemies do next to no melee damage to you. I don't know if you are aware for these items so i won't spoil them to you except if you ask, but the point is that you can afford (especially with a power build) to have any weapons that you like to have and take the -4 AB penalty with little to no consequences whatsoever. So, if you want some suggestions for weapons i say go with hammers and bastard swords, cause they look badass and you can have the hammer of thunderbolts and bloodletter swinging at the same time! With some Red Dragon Disciple treatment and -later- Devastating Critical you will feel like Theseus and everything that dare comes before you will be dealt swiftly and mercilessly. And here is a hint for ya, if you like to keep Aribeth and generally have the NPC's be really nice to you, then put full ranks into Persuade skill, you will never regret this for the Original Trilogy as it is ideal for a Paladin - like hero ;)</div>"

I've always had a thing for hammers - much underrated tools of havoc - but you need Connla's (Conlan's?) in Icewind Dale, and the Crom Faeyr in BG is awesome, so... But even baby hammers are good, and seeing an elf with one would be great. I don't know what Red Dragon Disciples do, but I'm happy to bow to knowledge. If either your good self or the sweepingly talented Empyre65 would be prepared to offer a build, I'd be more than happy to waltz it through the OC and (yes, I know now) subsequent campaigns.<br/>\n<br/>\n Excellent community, glad I came!</div>",

      "content": "<div>Whoah there! You guys are trying to cram too much into a single build. Taking Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Epic Weapon Focus, Epic Weapon Specialization, Overwhelming Critical, and Devastating Critical for 2 weapons, plus Power Attack, Cleave and Great Cleave to qualify for Dev Crit, plus the 3 dual-wielding feats, plus the essential Blind Fight, Epic Prowess and Armor Skin adds up to a staggering 13 pre-epic feats and 10 epic feats. That would make it impossible to keep Bard and Fighter even, which would result in a 20% experience point penalty because neither class is the favored class for an Elf: Wizard.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'll make you a build dual-wielding a single type of weapon, and let you choose what that weapon is. My suggestion of shortsword was not only to minimize that dual-wielding attack penalty. When you first encounter Enserric the Longsword in HotU, you have a dialog option to say you don't need a longsword. He will then offer to change into a dagger, a shortsword, or a greatsword. He has vampiric regeneration, which heals you every time you hit an opponent, and it is fun having a talking sword.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>EDIT:</strong> Here it is: I recommend going sword-and-board until you get the dual-wielding feats.

I've never played with a shield before (my completed run-throughs have been as greatsword-wielding dwarf and straight-up human monk), just got lots of dough for them, so that'll be a new experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n Btw, just out of interest, why is it that elves have wizard as their preferred class?

I made him a bloke to pursue any possible future womance with Aribeth, and Dow-looking, just to confuse the buggers. I decided on handaxes - the action animation seems more vicious with them (probably says more about me than it should).<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, back to numptydom. Having not played a bard or magic-user before, except for a brief dalliance as a cleric-ranger in BG which ended grimly and messily, do you have any advice on armour type, please? My natural inclination is to go for medium, which would allow my dex bonus to work properly, and boost AC with this new-found shieldy thing until I start dual-wielding, but I don't know whether that would negate spell-chucking. I'm not intending to do a lot of that, but I want to be true to the build and a bard type clunking around in full plate just seems...wrong (although it might give a rhthym section to his song, I suppose).<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and one more thing, if I may. As far as the skills are concerned, I notice you both use digits and bracketed digits - eg, 43 (58). What's that mean? I know we max discipline, and it looks like the same is true of persuade and tumble (which is what I also did for my previous monk character).

As to some of the real spells/buffs if your not in battle just have your armor(and shield early on)  quick slotted take it off cast and slap it back on. The abilities are listed as to what you've allotted and what they are modified to because of stats/feats.so with your disc example 43 is what you put into it and 58 is what it's modified to.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Straight for the answers,<br/>\n<br/>\n a) Unfortunately Elves are implemented very badly in 3rd ed. of ADnD, until we meet the Sun Elves in Faerun, what's strange is that although Neverwinter Nights takes indeed place on Faerun it has not implemented the Sun Elves as a sub-race, or Drow for that matter, leaving us with a totally worthless base Elven race that has no affiliations whatsoever with magic- that is supported at least by the rules. They could at least have as favored class the Ranger and that would make sense since at least Rangers can make use of the dexterity bonus but instead we get Mages. Truth is that the stock Elves makes absolutely the worst Mages possible and here is the Irony, Dwarves makes (alongside Gnomes) the best! Chief reason that we take Elves in Neverwinter Nights is either role-playing or PvP. Don't ask for now, \" why \" for the later because this will take some time to explain and you won't be interested in (P)layer (V)s (P)layer maches for a while. Ah, okay we choose Elves for Arcane Archers too i suppose, we can't avoid that since it is a requirement heh.<br/>\n<br/>\n b) The answer to which armour is the best for your type is better given from Minsc himself ~ Full Plate and Packing Steel !<br/>\n And there is a reason for that too, as implemented in Neverwinter Nights, the Full Plate will always give you the best AC possible unless you build a dexterity-based character (do that afterwards - is fun). Going with medium armor should be based primarily on the special properties of the armour. For example, you remember the Djinni you can take with you in HoTU and has a special store that you can buy things from? He sells the \" Lesser Golem Armour \",\u00a0 now that armour is a prime example for which one may choose to have less AC from what a Full Plate gives to get some really powerful properties. But plain and simple if you want the best AC around then it is always the Full Plate! (no Shadow Dragon Armour/ White Dragon Scale here, heh).<br/>\n<br/>\n c) As far as your build is concerned don't take into consideration spellcasting at all. The Bard's Song is a feat essentially thus it is not subject to arcane spell-failure like normal spells. Sing as much as you like!<br/>\n<br/>\n d) Ah the skills, alright here is how it goes:<br/>\n The first number is the actual ranks you put into them and then the second number in the brackets is the modified ranks you will have (the real number) as they are affected by your ability scores and synergies. In most cases the second number is what you should be looking at but there are few examples that the first number is all that we care for. A prime example of that would be (Tumble: 40 (43)) As long as we have forty ranks in \"Tumble\" we get the maximum possible AC bonus (+8) for our build, so the number in the brackets means nothing to us, but for all the rest of your skills the number in the brackets is what the real value of that skill is.<br/>\n<br/>\n Good Hunting!<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

If you did cast a few buffs, I would fill any spell slots with lvl 1 magic weapon and mage armor lvl2 bulls strength or ghostly visage wouldn't mess around with much of anything else.

While it was considerably easier as a ground-standing, gnarled and spitting dwarf, and even a slippery human monk (albeit strength-based) I've just Hannibal Lecter'd the intellect devourer in chap1 of the OC, which may not mean much to the great and good, but it's better than death and damp celery. It's taken a fair old while, and I was beginning to despair, but, thanks to SmkNDrkNght (which I'm guessing is something Dark Night, and really hoping it's not Smack Naked, 'cos that'd just be too odd - no offence intended, I promise) I've got there through my choral skills.

Keep in mind something important though that you will see it later in the game. When you get devastating critical with your character, you will be able to kill twice that much with the short-blades than with your hatchets. Not that you will have much trouble to kill anything for that matter with this build, devastating critical - or not, but just saying. Personally i would go with dual-bastard swords, the game has an extreme fondness for them plus they just look plain awesome OR a two-handed greataxe for the sick criticals and to take advantage of that gigantic strength you are going to have (52 strength at the end). Dual hatchets are cool too though, it reminds me a bit of \" The Patriot \".<br/>\n<br/>\n * As i said before, it is hard not to overload you with information (devastating critical, bard song, henchmen quests, dual-wielding, e.t.c) so just ignore my rumblings :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ~ Jump on my sword while you can evil - i won't be so gentle!</div>"

      "content": "<div>That particular build I found on this site, before joining the guild. I've just had a scan through and can't find it right now, but it's not dissimilar to magaiti's Weaponized Wall build in the Full Epic section, nor, indeed, your own from Feb this year in this section. I, obviously, finished at level 27 or 8, but the last stats I wrote down were at level 25, which I'm v happy to share should you wish. I do know from memory that in HotU I belted that irritating Drow ass who attacks you just before the Beholders' Lair in the Underdark with one critical from a level 7 (at that point) Dagger of Chaos to the tune of 252 points of damage - the next three hits in the round almost didn't matter. I had an AC of 40-odd, was hasted, and regenerating c10 HP a round while immune to criticals and carrying over 550 HP myself. The build was (at level 25) 8 levels of Fighter, 7 of Weapon Master (Great Sword) and the rest as Dwarven Defender. Breakdown available, as mentioned. The other build I went all the way through with was as a strength-based pure monk (didn't make notes, just did what seemed sensible from my BG2 monk days), but I had Linu with me all the way in the OC for healing and comforting words. By SoU and HotU, pianos dropped on head would be about all that could hurt me - except emotionally, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and it's not that I didn't use any healing potions early on, 'cause I did, but I always found enough lying around not to have to buy any. This time, so far, not so lucky. However, as I said, playing smarter - strain though it be - is bearing fruit, and I have faith in the build long-term, albeit 'someone has deaded me' (if anyone likes the Goons) more times than I care to mention to date.<br/>\n<br/>\n And no, I have no enhancements so far, just patched the latest 1.69 and went for it, but thank you for the links, which I will have a look at as a minimum. To be fair, I didn't do much to BG except for DSotSC, but when I did later (BGTrilogy and assorted other bits and bobs), it crashed hard and still won't play nicely (or, indeed, at all) with me...which, in all honesty, is why I started taking NwN a bit more seriously, hence my buggering up other people's nights with dumb questions!<br/>\n<br/>\n Rapidly running out of memorised Minscisms, so will return to my favourite - 'Ooh, squirrels!

I'm on the verge of levelling up to 6, where I'll be taking my first RDD level. Empyre and yourself suggest the knockdown feat here, but it's one I've never used before, so is it worth it, or would I be better served by picking up 2-weapon fighting earlier than suggested (at L9)?

However, now I have some back-story, I can't help but wonder about the 65, given the volume of numbers out there, and particularly as 65 was my yob (is that an accepted acronym for year of birth?).<br/>\n<br/>\n Valefor, the Song of Ice and Fire reference hadn't even occurred, even with a passing resemblance to John Thom(p)son. (Oh, bum, now I've questioned the Robert Baratheon actor, I've questioned the order of 'ice' and 'fire', and should probably have stuck with Game of Thrones, but wanted to appear knowledgeable about something for once.) Re the knockdown stuff: I know you suggested I could practice in the Beggar's Nest, but I acted as always and just did one sweep of the streets and houses with no break - it's a release of tension after failing to get Meldanen to surrender 8 times on the bounce. Got him eventually, though, and therein lies my confession...<br/>\n<br/>\n You may remember my pompous 'when I role play...' routine from a couple of days ago; well I sold it down the river tonight. I was getting nowhere with Meldanen, so sodded off to do the Gauntlet Challenge for the xp and nicked the dragon blood from the table in Meldanen's room before he arrived so I could upgrade my hatchet to Ice Reaver +1 before going back to thwack him, which I wouldn't have known to do if I was 'playing the role' as I said I did.

And it's better to have choices even if you don't use them much, rather not to have them, or so i think. Another thing that i find \"funny\" in a way is how much these \"uber\" builds that we make here are almost never better than the standard ones when it comes to the O.C You see, i am 100% sure that if you took a pure half-orc barbarian (for theme) and started with 20 strength and a huge greataxe you would have no problem whatsoever with any of these encounders, and that is partly because the \"uber\" builds need all the levels that they can get plus they are made for low to medium Persistent Worlds mostly that also use an advanced a.i of some sort. What happens now with your build - which in fact is one of the strongest around - is that you stuck to the point that you get no AB increase for both the first Bard and the first RDD level while you wield a small weapon, so you got behind for a while, thus you are struggling a bit. This is an early sacrifice that you had to make in order to be powerful later on. Do not worry though, things will get better soon and kudos for you to stick with your choices.<br/>\n<br/>\n What's more surprising though is the fact that you made me enthusiastic about the game again after lot's of months and here i am working alongside you with the same build and being roughly in the same area, in fact i just completed the warrens of the damned myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n Good hunting!<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

My question is this: knowing the correct order to take the wands (as I do), why won't the water wand work for me? It's grey, so useable, but whenever I click on it in my quickslot I get a 'you cannot use that item' message. Now, it's probably me, trying to take the wands in order and use them as I pick them up, when I should wait until I've got all four, but that didn't seem to work either. So, aargh.

With this one, I'm spending lots of skill points into the social skills: Persuade, Intimidate, and Bluff because there are lots of times where those would come in handy and I am tired of always failing those checks.<br/>\n Then, I'll play a dual-kama Monk 25 / Sorcerer 1 / RDD 14 in SoU / HotU / Sands of Fate.<br/>\n Finally, I'll play a DEX-based unarmed Monk 25 / Fighter 10 / Shadowdancer 5 in the Aielund Saga.<br/>\n<br/>\n These builds should last me through next year. I might squeeze in other modules that I've seen recommended recently. I'd be happy to post any of these builds or ones I have played in the past. I could also list the last several I've played.</div>",

I get inklings that I'd like to see what a half-orc ranger or, as in this case, an elf tank, could do, and see what happens. Ordinarily, I'd get halfway through chapter 1 of the OC, or maybe even reach Beorunna's Well before thinking 'nope, ain't working', and have a look elsewhere, hence my only having finished twice. Probably this haphazard bobbing around of mine was one of the triggers to come to you in the first place. Your way is clearly smarter, and hats off to you for the application and foresight. Still...blimey.<br/>\n<br/>\n I may well take you up on your offer to partake in (of?) your builds once\u00a0 my/your current dude hits 40 and is done (as happens so often in life at that age), thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n And, while I think about it, within the OC I've always said my favourites were the Docks and the Beggar's Nest, and I've only just realised (pillock that I am) that may be down to the fact that my character is better enabled to deal with the situations than in the first two. The build is feeling more comfortable with me, and I'm coming to terms with how to play him. I still haven't used knockdown, and only remember to use my bard song after I've been deaded once - which is better than 8 times, to be fair. Currently at level 8, and I now feel my character and I are in tune (just noticed the bardic pun, sorry). Strangely, only this evening I remembered the benefits of doorway management as well!<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks again, Empyre, and good luck with the evil...you know what I mean.<br/>\n<br/>\n ~Your words are as sharp as my blade, though not half as shiny - ooh, shiny!</div>",

Not sure if anyone answered this already, so i just did anyway. Hmm, not sure about the water wand you asked, perhaps Empyre can answer that to you, he is playing the O.C more often than me so he maybe remember that one in case you haven't already figured that out yet. You seem to be doing alright with your elven draco-warrior, i am glad that things finally start going easier for you-keep pushing!<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Empyre, not a bad list but you could use some more variety there. For example you should try Adam Miller's \"Shadowlord, Dreamcatcher, Demon\" campaign for up to 17th level instead of the O.C. Those are some pretty good modules, legends back in the day and i promise there are not for evil dudes.<br/>\n While we are on it, i think most of us could use your list with past played characters, see if you can recommend something, and thank you for your offer.<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

I played the Eye of the Beholder for the first time early this year, and have another build planned for it. I'll be playing A Hunt for a Necromancer for the first time with the character I am playing now. That Saleron's Gambit Saga you posted about recently intrigues me, and now this other campaign, too.

I said earlier that I might add other stuff in he list, and this is the type of stuff I had in mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n Here are the past several builds I played, going backward from the from most recent, which reinforce the idea that I am in a bit of a rut.<br/>\n Fighter 18 / Bard 7 / RDD 15 - SoU / HotU / Sands of Fate<br/>\n Cleric 4 / Fighter 14 / Weapon Master 22 - Aielund Saga (A little bit of Cleric was sprinkled in for role-playing reasons, but I didn't want to really play a Cleric.)<br/>\n Rogue 19 / Monk 11 / Fighter 10 - SoU / Nether Scrolls / HotU / Sands of Fate (same build I am playing now)<br/>\n Bard 11 / Fighter 14 / RDD 15 - Eye of the Beholder (my first time with Eye of the Beholder)<br/>\n Bard 11 / Fighter 14 / RDD 15 - OC / Aribeth's Redemption (my first time with Aribeth's Redemption, very similar but not identical build to the one listed just above)<br/>\n Rogue 17 / Wizard 1 / Arcane Archer 22 - SoU / Nether Scrolls / HotU / Sands of Fate<br/>\n Monk 25 / Sorcerer 1 / RDD 14 - Aielund Saga<br/>\n Fighter 18 / Bard 12 / RDD 10 - Aielund Saga (no focus on any weapon, allowing the player to use any melee weapon equally well)<br/>\n In between and before these last 2 were some now-forgotten builds in the OC and in Sou / Nether Scolls / HoTu / Sands of Fate.</div>",

Ended up blowing a raspberry at Eltoora and her Mignon: life's too short to spend an hour trying to belong to a magic guild I couldn't care less about anyway. Well, I suppose I could care less, or I wouldn't have spent an hour on it. Loose ends, eh?<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyhow, am currently poised on the opening of the goblin/orc/bugbear caves just north of Port Llast (as Fighter 4, Bard 3, RDD 2 and tanking it with Boots of Hardiness+2, Gauntlets of Ogre Power, Tower Shield+2 and Lesser Ring of Power. Not much cash in pockets at the mo, but that'll come again.) and having a tea break. Again, questions arise, I'm afraid. Re armour - and I know we've had the \"full plate and packing steel\" conversation - however, while the mithril mail gives a straight +10 to AC, the armour of Horus Re (a straight +7) releases my currently contained Dex bonus, so gives +9AC and other bonuses (sonic and electrical resistance), and given I'm currently trotting about in Whitebone+2 (+9AC), I think I'm heading to medium armour for a while. Is that dumb of me? Am I missing something? I know neither are long-term keepers - Red Dragon Plate, and so on - and therein lies another question, perhaps more esoteric. As a Red Dragon Disciple, how should I feel about slaying Klauth the ancient red dragon in chapter 3? Will I even be able to, what with him being an actual red dragon (I know, not really actual!) and me being a humble acolyte?<br/>\n<br/>\n It's quite frightening the issues that pass through my head in a quiet moment or two. Oh, and it's the first time I've had Charisma above 8 - there are some pleasant folk out there, I even got a bit of slap and tickle in Ophala's place!<br/>\n<br/>\n ~ Choose your friends wisely, not all are as trustworthy as Minsc and Boo.</div>",

I saved all of my money up to this point and now i have the greater swordman's belt (28k gold, ouch!) the rest of my gear is +1 stuff mostly but my AC is very good (28 AC) for my level (7th lvl) so i have no problems with melee so far. Clarity potions are your friend when it comes to mages like Meldanen and the rest, remember that.<br/>\n<br/>\n As far as armour goes, i would just take whatever is more powerful at the moment, after a certain point you will be wearing the red dragon plate as you said but before that, use what is more powerful.

      "content": "<div>It appears that we use the @ signs for individuals here, so, that being the case...<br/>\n<br/>\n @Empyre: I bow as deeply as I possible to your build credentials. I'd thought, as one naturally given to power-playing, that my Dwarven Defender etc, would have been the toughest build you could get, but slender little Elf-boy has blasted all before him in double-quick time so far in chapter2: and with a hatchet rather than a greatsword! Granted, slightly different tactics were involved, but toe-to-toe he's still beating a double-toughened rock-biter. I know I'm currently only L10, but we be doing good things, my man!<br/>\n<br/>\n @Valerfor:\u00a0 'Smarty-pants' is my first reaction re Eltoora's guild: actually, my only reaction! (seriously, well done, but I shan't ask how you did it) As far as potions are concerned, clarity is very useful with mummies and the intellect devourer in chap1, but the first thing I do in chap2 (imho) is get the golden hat (sorry, circlet) from Eltoora. No more mental attacks, and you can flog the sash of shimmering for other belt-like items at a mere 2 points lost in terms of spell defence. I've kept it that hat all the way through to HotU both times I've finished the OC/SoU/HotU (given the enforced time without in HotU). You'll probably 'find' one (transfer ownership) relatively early doors in chapter 2, but it's also one of the best sellable items you'll find - where money seems to flow like water. Hell, I might not even have to rob!<br/>\n<br/>\n As to the armour question, as with many others, I was being unfair. I've thought a little about it now, and it's a 'nature: nurture' debate. The build gives the nature of the animal, what we do with it is the nurturing of the beast: and both are crucial to a successful character/campaign. So I'm going middleweight for a bit (if I get killed lots, I may change my mind, natch.)<br/>\n<br/>\n Most importantly...I can breathe FIRE! Gadzooks!</div>",

I'm properly tanked, with Frost Giant belt and Ogre Power gloves my STR is 29. I'm keeping the mirrored shield, just in case (ta, Empyre), together with a spare belt of Guiding Light for the old death magic protection. Immune to poison, disease, level/ability drain (which I loathe with a deep and abiding hatred), regenerating a bit and at least partially resistant to elements and stuff.

All the carriers of the sacred flame getting on board!<br/>\n<br/>\n I've just popped into the Temple of Tyr in Luskan at L13 to hear some worrying news of Aribeth (hmm, wonder what's happened to her...). The only things that really concern me in the City of Sails are the the Ruins of Illusk, an Iron Golem in the Host Tower and a couple of Arkelm's captors (I may be getting a little too cavalier now, that doesn't bode well).<br/>\n<br/>\n A question pops into my head. Given that it's 'Neverwinter' Nights, how come so little of the action takes place in Neverwinter? Two chapters in the OC, none at all in SoU, and HotU starts in Waterdeep. Mind you, I suppose the same could be said for Baldur's Gate, so shut it, Stagboy.<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Valerfor - I didn't know you 'could' kill Desther in Helm's Hold - doesn't that rather knacker the end of chapter cut-scene? Could you do it to Fenthick as well? I suppose you'd lose considerable goodness points, though...Still, might be worth it, he irks me.<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and I fear I may have slipped up on taking my skill points appropriately. I'm only spending them on class skills - depending on the relevant class - but wasn't aware I could carry over points to the next level-up (presumably what Empyre meant by 'Save' in his initial build. I thought that might be a skill in itself, but allocated the points elsewhere when I couldn't find a skill denominated 'Save'. Jameson's is a bad, bad, lovely drink.). However, I still seem to be bobbing along nicely, while trying to catch up on the skill points I've missed by taking shoddy ones (still pretty low on Perform, UMD and Tumble, but have caught up reasonably well on Spellcraft and Persuade). This shall be my random contribution to the build!<br/>\n<br/>\n Excellent 'crevice' quote, Valerfor!

      "content": "<div>Evening all. Am currently on L3 of the Host Tower in Luskan. It's the one that's packed with imps and quasits, which ain't hard work, but are a damn nuisance, so I thought I'd take a break for the night and have a catch-up/update with fellow travellers.<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Empyre: know what you mean about Monk in chapter one. It took me, like, forever, when I played through as 'pure' Monk, even with Linu helping (maybe Daelan would have been better at that stage?). However, henchfolk are a little beside the point now soloing is the order of the day, so I hope all progresses well.<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Mick Dagger: have you taken the 'pure' Bard challenge? How's it going?<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Dark Knight (or do you prefer Smoke as an abbrev ?): straight-ish caster? You got the cajones, my man! As to launching the game, I may have had similar problems (fortunately not yet in this run through). I found that at the start of every new chapter, or, more correctly, after each cut scene, my game screen would black out and wouldn't come back. The way I got round it was to make a named save just before the end of the chapter, knowing it wouldn't survive into the new one, exit NwN completely once I got black screen, reload the saved game, when I'd get constant flicker (like a blink every time I took an action) as soon as the new chapter began. Save then (while flickering), exit again, reload again at that save, and all was groovy. Not too much hassle while in game, but a thorough-going ball-ache at character creation, because you can't save before the first cut scene, so you have to create the same character from scratch 2 or 3 times, which is less than fun. Anyway, hope it's fixed now for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Valerfor: first of all, your graphics are ridiculously better than mine, you swine! I suppose that's down to the enhancements you cited earlier in this thread, which I'll now definitely take advantage of soon (\"but not yet\" - that bloke at the end of 'Gladiator'). And yes, Lerk's a dude you could take to your mum's for tea. Like you, Charwood is certainly my favourite element of chapter 2, as well as the most challenging, which is why I save it 'til the end of my time in Port Llast.<br/>\n<br/>\n I don't know how far others have gone yet, or whether this upcoming nugget of info is common knowledge or indeed applicable to your games, but I have found that once you reach the Pinnacle of the Host Tower in Luskan, unless your diary has taken the 'High Captains' bit into completed quests, you may not be able to access the area populated by the Creators - regardless of whether you've actually completed the quest or not. If that is the case, and it seems random (it has been for me when playing Monk, but not when Dwarven Defender), it's worth taking some form of missile with you in advance, because injuring one of the Creators will trigger the gates' opening (maybe a spell would work too, but I've not been in the position to try that). Otherwise, it can be insanely frustrating, and you'll never reach chapter 3.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'd find it interesting if, when we've all cleared the OC, we could share the order we did things in, and how we played certain things (such as what did each of us decide as Judge in Charwood, for example)? It might just be me, but I'm intrigued with how and when we play diiferently and, indeed, similarly - particularly given that I believe we're all playing as good guys. Maybe everyone else thinks that would be a waste of time, but I thought I'd ask.<br/>\n<br/>\n God, but I've rambled on here, sorry. ~Swords, not words!</div>",

At least the game had the good grace not to screw up the roof part of the Host Tower, which is something, I suppose.<br/>\n<br/>\n Host Tower was not too bad, but that sodding Iron Golem on level4 was a huge pain. The only damage I could inflict was 1 cold damage with my Ice Reaver, and as you can imagine, that was going to take some time to take the beastie down. Fortunately, although after a couple of minutes and a lot of healing, I admit, I remembered I'd got a Morning Star+3 stashed away in my bags (could pretend it was forward thinking, but I just hadn't got round to selling it yet). Made short work after then. Actually, the MS came in very useful against the Battle Devourers later on as well, in that it did damage, which none of my three hatchets did. So I'm hanging on to it for a bit, just in case.<br/>\n<br/>\n Levelled up to 15 (4F/4B/7RDD) just before meeting Arklem, which helped in dealing with his bogeymen. Currently 144HP, AC32 without mirror shield (Copper Dragon armour, speedy boots, Cloak of Fort+2). Wearing rings of Lesser Power and Elemental Protection, Amulet of Health, Golden Hat, Belt of Frost Giant Strength, Ogre Power mittens (I do like power builds). Wielding (when possible) Ember's Axe (good v extra-planars) and Woodcutter's Axe (good v shape-changers). Will be upgrading Ice Reaver to +3 asap in Beorunna's Well. 600 grand in back pocket, so not going\u00a0 too bad at the mo.

I adore the class, but have always favoured the improved robes of the Old Order (soak damage etc). Any particular reason for billy whizz robe?<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Mick Dagger - If you are indeed playing her evil, how does that work? Just one of those things I've never understood (not ethically, purely in game-play terms) - eg, how do you get to be the 'hero of Neverwinter' as a thorough-going rotter? I've thought before that I might have a go as an evil character, but have never grasped how to play one. Of course, those who know me might just say \"do what comes naturally\", but they're all gits.<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Valerfor - We're very close now. I've just completed the Coldwood bits (Nax and Layenne, basically) and the Snow Globe. I'm now heading off to Fort Ilkard, which I've previously left 'til last in chapter 3, but I'm still unsure enough of my hard-as-nails nature to avoid the dragons for now (I know, chicken). Anyway, you mentioned Rolgan's trial, and that has been problematic for me, on the basis that on initiation of the trial (when Neurik takes you into the back room - oo-er, missus), I had to run away from the prosecutor until everyone arrived because otherwise when he first spoke to me/the court, anyone who had arrived teleported out immediately and Rolgan got deaded. It took three reloads for me to run away long enough for the actual trial to begin. Then it got even worse. Halfway through the testimonies, everyone teleported out - four times running - and the best I could get was a 4-1 victory. I eventually took it, because otherwise the laptop would have exited window stage right. Not happy, my friend.<br/>\n<br/>\n Other than that, all is grand. And yes, speed always trumps toughness, even in DD-mode. Billy-whizz boots do seem to ignore dex limitations when it comes to AC as well - hence my parking the Hardiness+2s in my duffle-bag for a rainy day - rather than taking the fast mail train.<br/>\n<br/>\n Still bouncing along at L15, with Imp 2-weapon Fighting and hatchets for every occasion (Ice Reaver+3, a straight +3, and three variations of +2). Was tempted by Freedom Armour, but kept the Copper Dragon stuff instead and bought a proper ring of power (190k - ouch). Tomorrow, I will mostly be playing with elk.<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and I wasn't here for the great Aribeth debate of 2004, and far be it from me to re-open it now, but I think what Nasher has to say about Fenthick's reasoning at the climax of chapter 1, before we go off to Helm's Hold, would hold true for the lady paladin too. More importantly, paladins are by nature dull as ditchwater and a pain to be around, so anything that livens them up is to be applauded imho. What price a paladin/assassin/pale master build?

That's not to say BS and toffee hammer wouldn't, but we established early doors in this thread that it needed too many feats in my current build to work properly - hence my double chopper (?) approach, which definitely beats as it sweeps as it cleans (could do with a few more crits, but that's the price you pay, and it'll be improving in another couple of levels)<br/>\n<br/>\n A general Beorunna's Well question, if I may.

Thusfar, the build has been a delight to play.<br/>\n<br/>\n My big concern has always been the double dragons, but I'm feeling pretty good about them now (particularly as I'm wielding 2 Offhand Axes (+3 and 1-6 sonic damage) - guess I'll have to see.<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Valerfor again: do I see you dual-wielding BSwords?

      "content": "<div>@ Stagmeister,<br/>\n<br/>\n Yeah, i do sail on calm waters with the O.C You will be able to do the same and better when you have played a bit more.<br/>\n Great job with Klauth by the way, the double dragons (great arcade, brings back memories) should pose no real threat to you if you buff a bit beforehand and use your bardic song in conjunction, focus on one at each time and you should be fine. Freedom is a must too for the silver dragon's breath.<br/>\n<br/>\n The weapons i am holding are twin bastard-swords +3 sadly, no bloodletter drops at all :(\u00a0 But what you are seeing in the shots are not in necessity representative of what they truly are. I am using the in-game character customizer override that allows you to modify the looks of your equipment to whatever you want, so you don't look like a crappy piece of sh*t all the time. It's a very simple task to do, you just download this very small file and then throw the contents in your \"override folder\" in your NwN1 installation directory.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#0000CD\"><strong>Character Customizer</strong></span> -&gt;\u00a0 <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/hakpak/original-hakpak/customize-character-override-hak-ccoh\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn ... e-hak-ccoh</a><br/>\n<br/>\n After you finish the O.C you will want to start another module, maybe it is HoTU or Aribeth's module, no matter what the process is the same for all. You download the module and unjip it to an empty folder. The files from Neverwinter Nights Vault might have several sub-files in them but each one has an extension that you must follow. For example a module like HoTU needs no *haks or anything else so you just launch NwN1 then select the HoTU campaign and then you select your hero that you finished the O.C plain and simple. But another module that you download from the Vault might have several files in it when you unzip it. Take note at the extensions of the files, and do the following.<br/>\n<br/>\n a) If the module has files that end in *hak name, those you take and put into your corresponding *hak folder in your NwN1 installation directory<br/>\n b) If the module has files that end in *mod name, those you take and put into your corresponding *module folder in your NwN1 installation directory<br/>\n c) If the module has files that end in *bmu name, those you take and put into your corresponding *music folder in your NwN1 installation directory<br/>\n d) If the module has files that end in *erf name, those you take and put into your corresponding *erf folder in your NwN1 installation directory<br/>\n<br/>\n Basically it's a plain \"copy and paste\" of the various files that a zip file might have into your corresponding folders in your NwN1 installation directory. More often than not, the modules you are going to download will have a single *mod file in them, zipped for economy on size. You can then play those modules, simply by going to the \"New Module\" Tab of your start menu in NwN1 and then selecting the module you want to play. Then you can import any character that you like or start the module with a fresh level 1 character. Most if not all of the modules will specify in their description the level range that each module is best to start with, just as HoTU says in it's description it is best for levels 13 to 16.<br/>\n<br/>\n And don't hesitate to ask when in doubt, we are here to help after all :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

The only problem I had was in morag's inner sanctum, when I twice managed to impale myself on the blade barrier while heading for the relevant priesty type. Both Morag herself and the twin dragons were fine and dropped quick-sharp before my two Offhand Axes. In the source stone I did unearth some armour I hadn't encountered before - Dragon Armour (+9 to AC and I got my further +2 Dex bonus back, so +11, and +3 universal saves), which I tried instead of the Red Dragon Armour for the rest of the game, and 'twas fine. Used 1 heal potion v dragons, and another 1 after I broke through the blade barrier ('cause I took 164 points of damage). I did get Aribeth to turn herself in again, and she appears to have the hots for me (poor dumb paladin), so of we go...<br/>\n<br/>\n My final stats were:<br/>\n<br/>\n L18 (F6/B5/RDD7)<br/>\n Str 24 (31 with belt and gloves)<br/>\n Dex 16 (fully enabled, thanks to the aforementioned armour)<br/>\n Con 14<br/>\n Int 14<br/>\n Wis 8<br/>\n Cha 10<br/>\n HP 180<br/>\n AC 34<br/>\n Fort 19<br/>\n Ref 17<br/>\n Will 17<br/>\n<br/>\n All in all, pretty damn fine.

      "content": "<div>Evening All (for those old enough to remember Dixon of Dock Green).<br/>\n<br/>\n I am both monumentally pissed off and greatly pleased at the same time. The pissed-offness comes from both forumer, who keep wanting me to re-register every time I try to post a reply, and myself, because I downloaded everything for Aribeth Redemption 1-3 and was then told I couldn't run hak files. I therefore went to help sites, and Microsoft's \"preferred partner\" (reg cure, or something like that) spent two hours analysing my systems and then wanted money to fix them - and I still can't get rid of them. All of which has been a 'thwart disnatured torment unto me' (King Lear, I think).<br/>\n<br/>\n However, today I decided I'd just try going for play, and it worked simply and beautifully - I'd just put everything into the same folder - as soon as I put the mod(s) into the module folder and the hak(s) into the hak folder (who knew<em> they</em> were there?!) it was easier than learning to breathe. You people are stars!<br/>\n<br/>\n Hence I am now playing Aribeth Redemption - huzzah! This third incarnation of her avatar is certainly better than the previous two - both in elven and foxy minx (nearly went for minsc!) terms. Red Dragon dead, trial concluded, we're off to play with the Ilmateri Monks and their basement bother.<br/>\n<br/>\n If I had one question-mark so far, it's that you don't get many response options (ordinarily one), but I can understand why at this juncture. I'm just not great at being told \"that's the road, go down it\" - hence my particular love for BG1 - do what you like, when you like, until you hit the big bad city. Equally, one of my two downers on Icewind Dale was that you couldn't deviate from the 'path' (the other was that party interaction was minimal, given I'd created all of them).<br/>\n<br/>\n All that having been said, the unknown beckons, which is great: and it was grand to see some friends of the past in the city core. Special mention, if I may, to whomsoever produced this mod for the return of Mano - the only pleasant gate guard in chap1 of the OC (Beggar's Nest) - only a small thing, but it shows you care, so thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Empyre: because I'm a bit shit at reviewing who's doing what and when, you're monking, fighting and roguing (word?), yes? So you might hit L19 by the end methinks. I know I didn't do any of the sidekicks' stuff, so that might make a difference, but nonetheless...<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Valerfor: now you're just showing off! ;-) And I've had a bit more of a think on the 'Aribeth's weak' issue. I get all that's said in her trial, but taking the longevity of elves into account, together with her (and my, in this instance) relative youth, is this not a form of elf puberty? Or am I just stirring the pot?<br/>\n<br/>\n Regardless, thoroughly enjoying myself!</div>",

Now that you have seen how one runs, you know almost all of them, just keep the different files in their correspoding folders and you are good ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n As for the module, did you actually read all of these stuff everybody was saying? I was just pressing 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 then went for the quests, it's not that i had lot's of choices anyway. This is the most rail-roading module i have ever played, i tell you. At some point of the second part, if you even turn a corner that is not what the author intended Aribeth gets in front of you and tells you otherwise. And i won't even mention some of the monster placements, like what are they doing (8) Lich in a storeroom 3x3 lol. Still though, the series have some nice features and attention to detail as you mentioned does exist. The author also makes an effort to seek your purpose behind your undisputed love for her and even to seduce you (later), so that shows effort and i always respect that. It has lot's of action too and that means you won't get bored easily. Some of the points that i liked in particular is that he obviously is a Baldur's Gate fun, you will see why when Aribeth questions you about your past and his well-hiden humour. I am at the third instalment now and it seems to be the biggest of the three, you get the chance to select Aribeth's class there which is a welcoming addition ( i won't mention what i chose - and why till you get there). All in all, a fairly good module, i don't think i would play it again but i certainly like some of it's aspects.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take a good look at the Sunite's Paladin's armour <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/11.gif\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://i1375.photobucket.com/albums/ag474/valerfor/ImpossibleCleavage_zps89a86e44.jpg\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n You have absolutely right about IWD man, however from the time i discovered this add-on party my adventures were more than exciting again! The NPC's in this team are fantastic, in particular the Paladin (a gruff, dwarf-like in manners, heart of gold) and his half-Orcish! female squire are the best. The team is made professional-like in quality of the writing and voices.

Excellent man! You won't get disappointed by any of the Enhanced Ed. Beamdog has made, first of all the all their games run flawlessly for a change.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n As for your other question, this is something we all hoped it was true here...NwN 2 in not a bad game, not at all, but when you compare it to the original it's a far-far cry from it, exactly like how Dragon Age Origins (if you are familiar) is the best of the series by far. At first i wanted to answer to your question with a huge bolded \"32\" size letter, NO! but one cannot learn the reasons from one word unless he is a medium, so i will elaborate slightly with your permission.<br/>\n<br/>\n a) The main campaign is nothing like the original's one. It is instead a rail-roaded scenario that it will get you bored after the first two hours at most. The expansion's one is a tad better but not by much. The inflexibility of the main campaign shows from the very fiirst minute when you create a Yuan-ti or Drow hero and you still have the same good ELF guy that adopted you and your village has totaly accepted you like nothing happens! Yes, you can make half-snakes as youe heroes, and half- earth- elementals too...The scenario is so bad that i can't continue further, sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n b) NwN 2 needs a strong machine to play, because it is badly optimized. Let me say that again, badly optimized. Of course if you have quad- core with a modern graphics card this won't be a problem, but still.<br/>\n<br/>\n c) NwN 2 follows the 3.5 DnD ruleset which is a blessing in some cases (no more idiotic 1000 hp's heals or harms) but a bane in some others. This is because they have altered the default ruleset with some rules of their own making like BAB continuing to epic levels so the fighter-types get from six to nineteen attacks! As you probably have guessed this makes the game totally melee- oriented which might seems cool at the beginning but after a while it gets boring, since half of the builds you could play are gone or sub-optimal. The designers also reduced the available levels to thirty instead of forty and gone are the best spells like \"time stop\". Clerics still dominate the game and more so than before.<br/>\n<br/>\n d) This doesn't concern you probably at the moment but the PW's i have seen for NwN 2 are nothing like those in the Original. I won't elaborate here since it is not needed for now but let's say that they tried to turn NwN 2 into some serious role-playing affair without the action, meh.<br/>\n<br/>\n That's the main points but you get the idea, still not a bad game and it has some good modules to play (maime'd God's saga- same guy who wrote saleron's Gambit for NwN 1) plus a cool music theme but not something to get excited for.</div>"

Glad the tensions being still high wasn't just me, I was beginning to take it personally.<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Smoke: How times change, eh? In my day Druids wouldn't be let within fifty miles of scythes! Mind you, it's a bloody good change - restricted to slings, sticks and clubs (with the odd scimitar - still don't know why) was hardly helpful. Have fun when you know which area you're in!<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Mick Dagger: Only one thing to say really - awed. I'd never taken Bard terribly seriously before (my current build notwithstanding, natch), but have had to revise my opinion. Might try a Bard/Druid build next (though I'm still wary of spell-chucking).<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Valerfor: I don't remember any riddle either, I'm afraid - have I missed something? Am now in Hairy Beth's Redemption II and am currently getting my ass kicked by Beholders and Ettins. I have both Aribeth and Valas with me (or Uncle Valas, as I should call him, given I've told Aribeth I'm the godspawn and Viconia's child - although dad married Jaheira after Vicky's death. You were spot on, some great tying in with BG). I fear I went about doing things here somewhat out of sequence - I got the cure for the driders before even meeting them. And Aribeth has twice pulled me away from doors, as well as removing my Benefactor status thanks to her killing a couple of rock gnomes, which I've only just noticed. Thanks for that. I've noticed that I've stopped getting additional strength bonuses from equipment, but assume this is down to my enhanced str being 37 (which is +13). It came to my attention when exchanging a Fire Giant belt for a Cloud Giant one, and it made no difference, nor did it when I took off my Ogre gloves. It's all good, though, 'cause I can unload them to Ari and Valas.<br/>\n<br/>\n Was hoping to use today to catch up with you, but I just don't seem able to get my tactics right for this Beholder/Ettin fight. It'll come good. And, to be fair, I needed a tough fight 'cause I was getting too complacent. It would be handy, though, if all the sodding eye tyrants didn't just focus on me!<br/>\n<br/>\n Right, off I trot. Will update later only if I've proved successful against the ornery critters.</div>",

Fights are the best part of part three i must say, although this one is even more rail-roading than the previous ones. Sometimes it feels much like a video and you just have to press the \" play \" button to proceed. Anyway level twenty-three now and fifty armour class with no shield, also forty-one strength.<br/>\n<br/>\n Stagmeister, for the beholder fight (although i am fairly sure you are past it, by now) you just have to load-up on immuniities since there are about eight to ten death spells per round. Greater belt of guiding light and/ or greater amuler of health should make this a walk in the park. That being said, i did it the hard way and just overwhelmed them, that works too. And as for the riddle, you are not there yet, it is in the third part of the series, when you reach the waterdeep port. When you get there, tell me how it went for you, for me it was very hard to find out, but thankfully there is a party member that can help you solve this (the most beautiful dwarf you have ever seen, lol).<br/>\n<br/>\n Grand Dragon Battle!<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://i1375.photobucket.com/albums/ag474/valerfor/GrandDragonBattle_zpsd9ddbbcf.jpg\"/></div>"

Only took 2 heal potions and a resurrection of Uncle Valas to get it done - yee, and indeed, hah!<br/>\n<br/>\n Rest of the mod was fairly straightforward, though I confess to some relief that they were rakashas rather than illithids - I hate those tentacle-faced bastards. Just reached L22, AC41 (Golem Armour, Cloak of Fort+4 and Gloves of Fury), 233HP (Marathon Boots) and received my devastating crit for the hatchets, which is nice (haven't had chance to use it yet, but it sounds good).<br/>\n<br/>\n Do I see five dragons teasing you? That's a bit rich. And 12 bags of holding!? I thought I was bad with 6! Doesn't matter so much when you can wander round with 3713lbs on your back, though - and Aribeth was toting 466lbs at the end of part 2.<br/>\n<br/>\n Slight problem, Redemption III won't load. I've probably done something wrong, so I'll bin it and re-install tomorrow. It was never going to be that simple was it?

So, how about we kick off our elven singing dragons from the end of the OC and go into HotU? Mick's already headed there, so we might meet up on the trail... (Am I being a bit clingy now? If so, just tell me to piss off.) Plus it gives me the chance to get right what I ballsed-up in my (Empyre's) Monk/RRD/Sorcerer build.

Don't know where Mick's at currently? It shouldn't take me terribly long to get to the end, having only recently done so with Empyre's Monk/RDD build - the memory is fresh. The only problem with the memory is how I tied myself in knots down in the Underdark - I would like to be able to all 5 full side-quests, but would welcome advice as to the best way to do it (at the moment I'm still thinking both offshore quests, then all the onshore ones - I know it's an old debate). It was ballsing this up that disenchanted me with my last run-through - and probably made Cania even more insufferable.<br/>\n<br/>\n My intention after HotU completion is to take my character into 'The Gods Themselves', which should take me to L40 (never been there before), so that looks good. There are 3 other characters I need to play soon: Team Mazzy (obviously) - who I think I'll run through the OC (I'm familiar with the game, if not any of the character's content!); your Blossom (sorry, Grand Master of Flowers) - but you advised against a Monk-build for Adam Miller's campaign, so I'll have to do something else with him; and Mick's Minsc, who looks to be an excellent candidate for Adam Miller (although I seem to remember you giving me a little bit of a starter in a Barbarian build, which I think I might like to have a crack at). I have no idea about Saleron's Gambit, so I'll leave it to your sagicity.<br/>\n<br/>\n Time for a bit of a confession - I've also been playing your Ultimate Iron Fist Monk on the sly (in the OC), just 'cause I love playing monks - so my saves are getting a bit clogged up at the moment. Btw, he's marvellous. Only one Q: why Neutral? I know you say that's anti-smite, but I have no idea what that means (well, I have an idea, but it's got nothing to do with the game).<br/>\n<br/>\n Regardless, I'm happy to tag along wherever you suggest - I'm enjoying myself!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT</em></strong>: i) Btw, how did Aribeth not notice I'd grown crimson wings?

I will play it with an archived version of my Barbarian from Lvl 28.<br/>\n<br/>\n I am wondering though if you truly know your way through HoTU, so i will make a question for you. Have you found yet the \"Shroud Of Kings\"? OK, here is a second one, Do you know that you can have the Planetar fight by your side against Big M.? Argh, can't resist...How was the fight against Grimgnaw and his friends?<br/>\n<br/>\n Also i would like to point out that The Gods Themselves<strong> will not </strong>bring your character to 40 Lvl alone. If i remember correctly we will finish somewhere along 34th to 35th Lvl. In fact very few modules will allow your character to reach the final levels, with Sands Of Fate being the only exception to this for a module with a cohere story background and there are some few modules that will allow you to do that but they are mostly random dungeon generators with \"appropriate\" random monster spawns. For that, the best place - by far is a Persistent World. Secondly, about Adam Miller's campaign, it is not that Monks are not allowed or that they will be weak, but if i remember correctly he has put more emphasis to the classic elements, like plate and longsword knight. You can of course play it with anything you want, you will have three available henchmen to help you as well. My advice is to play something that is not overly complicated there or some build that matures late. Minsc<strong> is appropriate</strong> for that, just replace one of his early feats with blind-fight and maybe go with longsword/warhammer and shield. His extreme strength will come in handy and his FE bonuses against undead (hint!) and the like will help even more. Lastly, i am glad that you enjoy playing the Iron Fist, your question about his alignment has purely to do with the enemies that you are going to face. In tough modules and especially in PW's you will not want to risk getting a smite on your head without compensation for this, except if you role-playing perhaps. Oh, wait you said you had no idea what a smite is... Well, let's say that a Blackguard or a Paladin/CoT can smite their enemies (Good and Evil correspondingly) three times a day. The damage that a well-build character can do with those smites is over 300 easily in one hit. And of course you can roll a critical smite and the damage goes beyond the abilities of a normal calculator. In the old times there was a build called \"the damage adept\" that did <strong>over 2000 dmg minimum</strong> on a critical smite with his scythe.</div>"

If so, I'm there myself: did the disaffected daughter quest, and just done the two islands, and off to play with the undead now, after the sink-hole, (got a frozen screen after whacking the gong in Drearings Deep, but I'm not worried, it does that a lot with me at that point. I'll just reload a couple of times and it'll be fine). I know you're running as a pure Bard, whereas I'm Fighter/Bard/RDD - currently level 23 (F8/B7/RDD8 at the mo), dual-wielding handaxes (both with sonic damage, both keen, both regenerating, one +9 and hasted, the other +8 - anything else will have to wait 'til I see Riz again in Cania, except for the Str reduction stuff, which I'll get in the undead quest). I'm still in possession of a 'straight' +3 handaxe, and have been thinking about throwing some acid damage and enhancements at it, but I don't think I can come back to Lith My'athar again before the big scrap starts and I've no more spare cash, so never mind. Nice to have some company in the dark places of the world!<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Valerfor,<br/>\n<br/>\n Given that I'm not a Pally (so the girls won't want to play with me), and only have an 8 in wisdom (so the sleeping man will just keep having a nap), I guess I'm soloing it! I would like to have Deekin along - he's smashing company - but by that stage he's a Bard/RDD, and guess what - so am I (with Fighter thrown in), so it wouldn't add much I'm afraid. Oh, and I hate that demonic hand, and the shapeshifting amulet, and the ring that makes everything pinky-purple, so I use them as little as possible. That's probably why I've missed the King Shroud before. The pity of it all is that I'm tear-arsing through the parts of HotU that I love so I can get to the crappy bits more quickly!</div>",

For the Shroud of kings you don't have to look too much either, it's near where you got the sleeping man's ring, to the right little island. Use the demonic hand to get there and open the chest ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway don't worry too much, after you have played HoTU a couple of times it is better to use other modules for making your way up to that level, as HoTU is mainly for making that uber weapon(s) from Rizolvir. There is also a module list made from the community that is called \"The Hero's Path\" and has all the good modules that you can use to make your way up to that level with alternative ways, so you can choose your own path to glory based on the abilities/type of your character and your preferences.</div>"

Oh, and all Nasher's gear has bumped my STR to 46 with the Lesser Golem armour, which is quite ridiculous, I'm delighted to say.<br/>\n<br/>\n So now the 'urgh' of the frozen wastes and that damned leaping mimic beckon. Hey-ho. I think I'll only pick Aribeth up for the Sleeping Man clue, or I'll end up having to slaughter her again (which would particularly odd in my mind, having just gone through her redemption!). Hope all is going well for your Bard, Mick.<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Valerfor,<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks for the tips. I'm assuming that I've got to go back down to the Sleeper's ring chamber after I've got the glove, which I haven't done before - how on earth did you think of doing it in the first place? Anyway, shouldn't be long now 'til I'm done - Sunday or Monday, hopefully. Still need to know if there's a particular ending I need (kill big M, re-banish him, replace him) in order to play 'The Gods Themselves'. Happy to go whichever way is appropriate (I've re-banished him before, but been sorely tempted to splatter him all over the place).</div>",

I know many of the tougher foes aren't susceptible (though I was surprised that devil and demon lords are, which was nice), but it's grand to have it there. I took handaxe as my weapon of choice, which doesn't give as many crits as others, but with Imp Crit and keen it was quite sufficient thank you! In any event, by the end I was actively seeking encirclement by enemies rather than trying to pick them off one at a time - Great Cleave was behaving particulary well. Interestingly, or not, I found I was getting more Dev Crits when I hand the Offhand Axe +9 in my main hand rather than the acid-soaked hatchet +10. Odd. By then end I was using both Offhands (+10 in main hand, +9 in off), so it mattered little). Excellent result against Lolth, but possibly a little disappointing for you in gameplay terms!<br/>\n<br/>\n Off to do the necessary downloading. Fingers crossed...<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT</em></strong> Erm, The Gods Themselves isn't showing up as an 'Other Module' in my main NwN menu.

Hit that and a copy of your screen will be created at your native screen resolution in your Neverwinter Nights Directory, \"Screenshots\" folder. All your pics will be there. Optional, you can hit the \"H\" button while you play (hit pause first) before you hit the printscreen button, in order to hide all menus. Then you just need to upload your pictures to an internet server. I use \"Photobucket\" - (Google it) which is free, but limits the resolution of your picturres to 1024 x 768 or something like that, this is the reason why my screenshots seem a little tiny compared to Empyre's for example, but it will suffice for the most part. After you upload them there, then the only thing you have to do is take the Direct Link and copy it to your post, simple ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n b) Sorry, it is not an *exe file, Adam Miller's campaign is, but we will make this work don't worry. Here let me show you how to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>The Gods Themselves</strong> -&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/module/gods-themselves-trilogy\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn ... es-trilogy</a><br/>\n<strong>Castle Interior Hak</strong> -&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/hakpak/tileset/castle-interior-windows\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn ... or-windows</a><br/>\n<br/>\n Go to these locations and download the files. After you finish download them then, there is an Html Page that shows you how exactly to install the files. But anyway, it is very simple to do that by yourself, simply place all the *Hak files in your *Hak folder, the *Mod files in your *Modules folder and finally the *bik files in your *Movies directory. Then select the module from the menu and play. The first module is the same name \" The Gods Themselves \", this is what you select first and then when you finish, it will transfer your character to the next module.</div>"

I'm not even sure I understand what the hell you guys are doing, but I'm done with SP modules at least for the time being. I find that I have played this game too much that now only Multiplayer is any fun for me. Even soloing on WoG, which the world I have come to call home, has become an exercise of discipline more than a fun activity. Particularly because I am trying to level increasingly gimped builds from 1-40 over there to challenge myself\u00a0and so far have had no failures :D<br/>\n<br/>\n I have played the Sands of Fate series with my Aribeth build (the illegal version with BG instead of Fighter), and she performed quite well, but I got really pissed off with those weapon-eating slimes in the sewers and with the fact she had no way of dealing with them. I also\u00a0have a saved game of Linu in HoTU, but it's so incredibly boring (she's just too powerful for it) that I can't bring myself to complete act 2. I also have a saved game in Aielund Act 2 tracking down the assassin guild, but whenever I click on load, I can't bring myself to click on any of these files. My body reacts and paralizes my fingers before I load anything up. I think I need RL Freedom to be cast on me lmao.<br/>\n<br/>\n I might have fun doing some modules with someone's company, but from what I was able to grasp, that would go exactly against what you guys are doing here.</div></div>"

A Fighter / WM devcritter is not supposed to succeed on Search checks lol. By doing so he becomes worse at what he does best and better at things that are not his fort\u00e9. But in a solo campaign that you have noone to rely on to do the \"bureaucratic\" stuff it's understandable. TBH if that were a concern to me, I wouldn't play a Fighter / WM like urs. I'd play a more \"resourceful\" toon like Grizz's Citadel, a Fighter 14 / WM 7 Rogue 19 optimized DEXer, a Bard / Fighter / RDD (16/14/10), etc....

If I want a resourceful toon, I make an optimized one (like my Versatile Tank, for example).<br/>\n<br/>\n BTW can we post our progress in WoG here too or is it only for SP modules?<br/>\n<br/>\n I'll try my hand at this game you guys are playing.<br/>\n<br/>\n Aerie started out doing the Moathouse quest, ending it at level 6 (cleric 5 / Wizard 1) due to a Respawn when she went to town to sell items that were making her heavy. She was travelling through the marshes and got attacked by an Assassin named Raven, who she fought and defeated, then she proceeded to the city of Borderkeep to rid the area of the Kobold menace, ending the adventure at level 9 (Cleric 8 / Wizard 1). After that she fought Sahuagin and Kuo-Toas down at the Ruskis island, where she also bested a whole bunch of oversized crabs and a few undead that lurked in the area. She finished that adventure at level 10 (Cleric 9 / Wizard 1). The Kuo Toa Shaman Leader nearly killed her, but a lucky arrow right through his temple ended the creature's life (She was near dead and overweight, Bull's Strength ran out and she started moving slowly, no longer able to kite and run, so that was the last chance she had to kill the beast, and luckily she did so). After that she proceeded to behead the Kron Hill's Necromancer, although she was not strong enough to clear the whole area. As she ran outside, she was surprised by a Bone Medusa, who turned her into stone, making her wait a little bit until the server reset. After such event, she went back and delivered the quest, slaying a Gargantuan Sword spider and a few Huge Water elementals (very vulnerable to her kite-and-run tactics) and a few bandits as well, leader included. She then delivered the Necro's Head and was asked to investigate some strange druids, which she will do after she hunts down a certain Bandit Leader in the Cairn Hills. Now she is level 12 (Cleric 11 / Wizard 1). She was fortunate enough to slay a pack of dire wolves and a pack of boars in the Gnarley forest, so she's nearing level 13.<br/>\n<br/>\n Is this what you guys are doing?</div></div>"

In most low-to-medium magic PW's these things are in balance and crippling strike is certainly very useful all the way to forty. I have prevented even Dev, Crit, to work on me by quickly weaken a Boss encounter with my crippling strikes, in just one round i exhausted him from twelve points of his strength. You should download maybe a good PW module and try your luck there perhaps, solo campaign if you want, but you will see the difference for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n b) No, i was talking about the two completely new henchmen you have access to, a Pit Fiend amongst them and a Cornugon Cleric, hehe.

The fights have been easy, although he did die a couple of times due to his controller's stinginess with Healing potions. The new and improved battle tactics are working great in mitigating the peril of his foes. All archers have been easy prey to his kite-then-hide tactics, which makes them run in his direction and meet him head on with his melee weapons drawn. He's still not morphed into himself to use the Double Axe, as he's only level 6 and has just learned to fight with two weapons, but no Ambidexterity or ITWF yet. So he's walking around with his Large Shield +1 and Warhammer +1 with 1 Sonic damage. He's done all Hilltop quests, found and killed the glorified white deer, explored the elven ruins (and did all the quests there too: Nilmador, Ancient Sword, Elven Test) rescued Becka from the Giant Rumgut through persuasion on the first try\u00a0(how he achieved that with 6 CHA beats me though) and then proceeded to the Nether Mountains.\u00a0 After annihilating all Kobolds except for master Jumper and his crew, he spoke to Tymofarrar and agreet to take on the quest to kill J'nah. He then freed the slaves in the Gnoll caves, Glendir included, and secured the aid of the Gnolls to fight the evil sorceress. In the process, he met a curious Hermit fellow who sold him a belt of fear immunity, which will be a part of his gear until level 40, even if he doesn't put it on much. He also explored a bandit cave, got a key for a magic door at a double-entrance cave with some undead and a couple of magical trinkets and killed a few Wyrmlings inside another cave\u00a0 He will now descend into the ruins, but since he has no spells, his perspective there will be more of an observer than an active user of the device with the elemental types.<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

There you are, LETO's manual will explain everything to you. Wait, let me help you even more, go to the \"Editing Saved Games\" section and it will telll you how to edit your saved game (SaV) file. from there you can add anything you want in your inventory, then save the changes and load-up the new save and continue playing from there. To alter a property of a forged item though, you might want to look into the next section of the Manual, it is called \"Advanced Editor\" and it is a bit more difficult to do as you might expected but i have done it and you should be fine if you read carefully the instructions.<br/>\n<br/>\n Another way to do this, is to open the module in the Toolset and just modify the closest merchant's inventory (really easy) so you can buy the thing from her.<br/>\n<br/>\n Yet, another way to do this is simply use that relic that teleports you to the succubus merchant and just buy the best Bow that she has along with ten stacks of Greater fire arrows, this is what i did when i played the Pyramid of the Ancients with my stock Lvl 27 Barbarian from HoTU. It was a bit of hassle to go outside again and do that but it worked flawlessly and you don't have to edit anything this way. And it feels better too if i might add ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n Good luck in your endeavours!<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Max, good luck with your start, maybe show us a screen of your character too? The build i assume is the standard one you have posted in the Henchman builds?<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Empyre, maybe start a new campaign with Adam Miller's OR Saleron's Gambit campaigns when you finish your current run in SoF? That would be nice for a change of pace, from all the uber-high-magic modules we played so far. I am \"parked\" at module 3 of Shadowlords if you are interested on this.</div>"

The file is not bmp as you suggested. It's a TGA file, and none of the regular programs I use to view photos is working for visualizing them. Basically, I have the file, but I can't see it. Is there a specific program I need to open TGA files? The acct on Photobucket is created. I'm only waiting to figure out this screenshot thing to upload it and post it here.<br/>\n<br/>\n I tried Windows Photo Viewer, Windows Live Photo Gallery and even Paint Brush. Nothing! I get an error message saying the program doesn't support this type of file.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks for the patience!</div></div>"

And you as well Mick, your suggestion worked! I'm gonna try my hand at this right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for your Melee Cleric, I'd also consider War a very strong option for domain for AoV (Aura of Vitality) and Cat's Grace (helps you have more AC if you have 8 DEX).

So if you want Stoneskin, I'd say add Strength domain to your list of possible domains.\u00a0Moreso because Mage Armor is also a\u00a0lvl 1 spell, and all your level 1 spells should be Divine Favors after a certain point.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm just giving you food for thought, as I am a Cleric fan and self-proclaimed specialist. <span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83d\ude00</span><br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div></div>"

      "content": "<div>As you see in the above picture, Daelan is now fighting undead in the Oasis of the Green Palm. So far, no trouble for him. He rescued Zidan and asked Katriana for a reward of 500 gold, since she wanted to sell him goods to solve her problems. He thought he was entitled to a reward. The Stinger High Priest was easily defeated after casting only 1 Negative Energy Ray for a whopping 5 damage to Daelan, who at the time had 98 HP. He then kept trying to cast another unknown spell in melee range, to which Daelan responded with pinpoint slashing attacks from his Double Axe, breaking the Priest's Concentration on every attempt. Now, that goes to show how important battle tactics are, as Daelan had first lured Ghouls and Stingers out of the room with his bow and killed them outside of the Priest's sight. I suspect that if Daelan had rushed in, he would have been targeted by many spells before he could get to the creature.<br/>\n<br/>\n I have to say that I am reviewing a few things in terms of my previous statements, as playing this module once again has refreshed my memory. What I said earlier about SP modules being too easy is not exactly wrong, but I believe not exactly accurate either. For the first few levels, it's difficult, just like playing on a server, but after maybe 6 to 8 levels, it just doesn't scale up properly. On WoG, I normally fight Zombies at levels 1-4, 5 tops! Here in SoU, they are introduced at level 8! Couldn't I be fighting tougher monsters at level 8? Next level, Daelan will get Ambidexterity and ITWF, so his current 3 APR at Full BAB (-2 dual-wield though), -4 (-6) and -5 (-7)\u00a0will become 4 APR, 2 at full BAB (-2) and 2 at -5 (-7), so from next level on, if the enemies don't become much harder, he'll just blast through them. But I digress...<br/>\n<br/>\n Back to the current adventure, the undead\u00a0are pretty much a cakewalk at level 8, and Daelan has a cloak of Bludgeoning Resistance he got from the elven crypt, so he's practically immune to their attacks thus far. He's getting ready to enter Kel Garas' crypt and hoping for tougher fights, as he needs to challenge himself to be able to grow. I will now go back to the game, rest and enter the tomb!<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div>"

The Tomb was fun, and much harder than the Zombies outside, thankfully. Daelan almost died to the Zombie Lord because I rushed in, but again, it's amazing what a little battle tactics can accomplish. After finishing the fight with 5 HP, I rested and vowed to not be a blind left-clicker. I was able to survive certain death just with a tactical approach. In the room with the four statues, I entered and sniped Kel Garas, then he Paralyzed me, but I was out of range of the Creeping Doom effect, then Kel Garas himself walked in, got damaged and disappeared. I just waited for both the Paralysis and the Creeping Doom effects to end, and proceeded unharmed.<br/>\n The rest was easy, even the last fight, although I had to heal. The Statue of Jergal was the hardest foe, but not that hard when you buff, which Daelan did. Now he's at the Ao Encampment and I will stop for lunch.</div>"

The only tough battle was against the Wise Wind, but I figured it out after a few moments. He had a Belt of 20 Slashing resistance, so I switched over to my Heavy Flail and finished him easily. There was a nasty Zombie fellow I wasn't able to kill in the Dead Wind quest, but having killed the wind\u00a0when it first became invulnerable\u00a0and grabbed the loot, I had no reason to stay there, as they were worth no XP anyway. The only times I had problems were the times when my gear wasn't up-to-par with my enemies, like with the Shield Guardians. They have such heavy resistance to Physical attacks that I had to switch over to a 2-hander to do any damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n I was wondering, though, if there wouldn't be another campaign that wasn't HotU to do before Sands of Fate, because Daelan is already quite powerful (and admittedly not very resourceful for disabling traps and finding tough to find secret doors), so I know HotU will be too easy and then he might get stuck on SoF if I ever manage to finish that. TBH those weapon-consuming slimes are a pain, and if, as Empyre said, there are 40 DC secret doors to be found, Daelan will fail (even though he has a bit of Search as part of the HS requirements). I could mess around with the skill points, but I don't want to. I'd rather take another toon through these two.<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, let me know!</div>"

      "content": "<div>I think so, in Pyramid they appear all three of them together and they throw themselves at you, makes for a nice fight. The T-REX's you see in the pictgure below they all have &amp; Dev. Critical with their bites (makes sense) and you have to maneuver smartly if you don't want to face them altogether, which is a recipe for disaster. There is also an Ancient Dracolich that hunts you in corridors with swifting walls, a bizarre sphere that shoots rays of Death (a very clever puzzle) and a Phantasm so strong that you cannot possibly harm it (but it can harm you!) that wails like a banshee and it's fear bypasses the typical immunities. It really is a very good example of a Gygaxian module, that challenges mostly the player and not the build itself, although a very strong build can &amp; will make things much more easier of course. My advice, take your character directly from HoTU to the Pyramid, and you will have a very good challenge, and still reach 40 Level by the end of it. You will need good search however, that's the only condition.</div>"

No magic armours found under debris or inside the barrels and not everyone can sell you magic items, like they are potatoes. And take notice that the essence of a High magic setting isn't the plusses on your items but rather the Immunities that do the most damage. When you can equip yourself to a point that the only things that matter are HP's &amp; AC/AB, then the game becomes dull (at least for me) especially when we take into account the unmodified Heal potions of the normal game. Thankfully Aielund (with the EMS Hak) and most PW's have abandoned that Archaic design and brought us some real challenge to the game, without it-it would have long be a dead game...</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hello!<br/>\n<br/>\n Couldn't think where to put this (careful...), so thought here might be appropriate, given that I'm taking my original non-shooty etc elf through Aielund now, and I know Empyre's travelled that road (admittedly when it still permitted Dev Crit). So this is where I've come to ask dumb questions about it, update on progess and the like (I'll try to stick some screenshots on too, once I've remembered how). Hope that's ok - I'm sure you'll tell me to sod off if it's not.<br/>\n<br/>\n I assume I'm coming up to the end of the first mod (Nature Abhors A Vacuum, a Dyson, a Hoover...), because I'm currently level 8 (F4/B2/RDD2 - swapped the order a bit to get WS a level earlier), and I understand that this mod should finish at L8 or 9. Am about to rescue a princess (how very old-school D&amp;D - yeah!).<br/>\n<br/>\n First off, I'm really enjoying it, even if I did manage to get myself ignominiously deaded by rats within the first half hour - that'll teach me to get cocky. It's nice to be playing with companions again - and the AI for them is monumentally better than in the OC - one of them even ran up and asked if he could attack, 'cos I'd forgotten to take him off 'Follow'. (he didn't say the last bit). However, I have a few Qs about the mod, if you don't mind...<br/>\n<br/>\n 1. Some of the available weapons are ones I've not encountered before (very Oriental, in the main). Now, I'm committed to my boy and his hatchets in this build (I know, I know, shortswords would be better, but comfy slippers and all that - though I almost took toffee hammers!), but, in future, if I took up one of these aberrant weapons, would I be able to take WF and/or WS in it? I don't know how the list works. I wouldn't want to be walking round looking cool but getting splattered by a goblin elite every time.<br/>\n<br/>\n 2. Will I be able to take my gear/loot/companions into the second mod, or would I be better advised to sell it all off/wish them a cheery farewell? And (for the selling) where? All the shops in both towns seem to be out of coin currently (a bit like Aribeth Redemption in Silverymoon, if I remember rightly), and I've got some nice stuff...<br/>\n<br/>\n 3. More of an observation than a question. When taking Bard levels with an INT of 14 (+2), I expect to get 6 skills points at each level (right?). However, it seems I'm getting 8. It all seems right for Fighter and RDD levels (2 + INT modifier), so I don't know if it's a bug or I've misread the Bard description. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining - 7 Bard levels with an extra 2 SPs and 7 with 3, that's 35 more SPs to make use of! But, if <em>it's</em> right, and <em>I'm</em> right, that has ramifications for building specifically for Aielund, doesn't it? And if Bard is different, are others (Rogue, Cleric, etc)?<br/>\n<br/>\n Er, that's it for now - other than one more observation. When it gets dark in Aielund, it <em>really</em> gets dark - it's the first time I've used a torch for anything other than burning plague victim pyres (nice work if you can get it)!<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/11.gif\"/></div>",
