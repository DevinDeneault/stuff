      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hello, first time poster. I've only very recently found the site, and decided to join today because it seems like a nice place, with nice people - and because I also can't seem to find many NWN communities still talking about builds.<br/>\n<br/>\n So a couple of weeks ago I happened upon two things: NWN Diamond on GOG, and the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/arch/cc\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NPC Closeup Archive</a>, which was a regular set of articles by Wizards of the Coast where they'd showcase some NPCs, going through their backstory and character sheet through various levels (1, 4 and 7 or 2, 6 and 12, for instance). I played NWN a lot when it came out, then burned out on it until HotU, and then burned out on that one again. But it's been a while, so I bought the game and decided - based on a lack of character ideas to (role)play - to try and see if I could recreate some of those NPCs, as best as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, I say \"some\" because there are some cases where that NPC Archive isn't useful for NWN - mainly because it's for actual D&amp;D and not a computerized version with a series of limitations and tradeoffs. However, it's still possible to recreate a number of similarities or ideas. My first attempt so far is for the character <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/cc/20020126a\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Zola, Sorcerer of the Scars</a>. The backstory involved is fine for what it is, though the mechanics are proving to be a challenge in NWN for some reasons:<br/>\n<br/>\n *Half-Elf, so it won't benefit from an extra Feat at character creation.<br/>\n *Exotic Weapon Proficiency with Kukris, which... Adds quite the flavor, but seems strange for a Sorcerer, especially since the STR and DEX indicated there don't exactly push him as capable of fighting. There are combat-fuelling spells, further specializations and DEX investments, true, but I think this would compromise more usefull spell-based Feats.<br/>\n *Charm Person, which is - from experience, limited as it may be - a pretty useless spell (no noticeable effect in combat or outside, unless for purposes of improving NPC reaction, which can be swayed with other spells or potions; and I can't remember many times where it affected, if it affected at all, merchant prices).<br/>\n *Scribe Scroll at an early stage, which is useless until HotU.<br/>\n *Points into Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Search and Spot when these aren't Class skills (and how useful are these for non-Rogues in NWN, anyway?).<br/>\n *An Owl familiar - though hey, that's really more cosmetical. Personally, I think the Hellhound kind of fits the character, so I'm going with that instead :P<br/>\n<br/>\n So, I guess this leads into two questions/build advices:<br/>\n<br/>\n 1) The backstory points out he used a \"kukri of wounding\", which was \"used many times during his missions\". His strongest suit seems to be his arcane manipulations, not his knifeplay, but it also suggests he used it often. What would be the major issue of having a Sorcerer built for spells and melee, even if the physical aspect wouldn't be as powerful? I know precious spell feats would fall behind, though how many is many, if we were to adjust the build for serviceable melee vs. adjusting it to handle himself in a fight, even if resorting to a lot of buffs (and probably no henchmen, just the familiar and the ocasional summons)?<br/>\n<br/>\n 2) The build (and character background) caps at 12, though I'd like to take it up to 40 in NWN. I've been thinking of eventually adding PM and RDD levels, perhaps 23 Sorc/10 PM/7 RDD (or switch the RDD with PM for earlier stat bonuses and larger HD, even if just for a couple of levels). RP-wise, I'm sure RDD and PM could fit too.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks in advance for any suggestions :)<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

A spellsword is not a cleric and has few buffs that will increase the chances of hitting with their attacks.\u00a0 That means, the fewer levels of sorc pre-epic, the stronger the melee presence during the entire build, but the less magic-focused it will be early on.\u00a0 RDD can help a bit, but is not a panacea when you must split ability increase between STR &amp; CHA (a Dexer is not an alternative with RDD since it does nothing for that ability).<br/>\n<br/>\n Most high-level sorcerers would be using polymorphs of Polymorph Self, Tenser and Shapechange to establish a melee presence in situations where spellcasting won't work (like vs. raks and demilichs, for instance).\u00a0 That means a spellsword relies mainly on equipment to boost their AB enough to hit reliably (GMW only helps up to mid-magic) while their spell DC and penetration becomes watered down by fewer caster levels and less-than-dominant ability level.\u00a0 (Note: PM really hurts SR penetration for all but custom class mods.) This is then the main decision.\u00a0 What AC levels is your spellsword likely to encounter and how successful a melee presence are you willing to settle for?\u00a0 Then we would build around these metrics to uncover a suitable compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\n It is not my intent to sidestep answering your main ideas with generalities, but rather than send you on a wild-goose chase with a partly-conceived recommendation, I opt for clear definition. And hope you follow the train of thought and logic behind it.<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, btw... not only are <em>Scribe Scroll</em> and <em>Craft Wand</em> a boon to arcanists in most environments, access to those feats can actually determine whether a high-level solo spellcaster is viable at all. You'll need to know beforehand whether the content provides blanks scrolls and skel bone drops (or bone wands) to decide if you can take advantage.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi, HipRedux, thank your for welcoming me :) And on the contrary, I do not find these to be generalities, but very helpful questions in order to refine the concept. I hadn't even thought of some of these possibilities until I started writing this topic.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for the guidelines, most of these can be summed up as single-player: the official campaign and expansions. I'd like to explore some PW's in the near future, however, my internet connection is really not suited for stable play at this time - and might not be for the next couple of months, as I'm moving away soon and will have to deal with new ISPs and whatnot. So for now, I'm only considering a Level 40 jaunt across the OC + SoU + HotU. If I end up a few levels short, I'll possibly work through some of the premium modules included in the Diamond package too. For this character, I'm also considering a familiar and summons, and likely no henchmen.<br/>\n<br/>\n It is the less magic-focused aspect I am wary of. From memory, there were magic \"peaks\" across the OC that left my melee fighters in trouble, though with henchmen, these were doable. In HotU though, I found myself using spellcasters more often (and you've reminded me of shapechanging spells and how I like them). I think, considering the entire \"trilogy\", that a spellsword might be more effective until late OC + beginning SoU, if he were as balanced as possible; but a \"purer\" spellcaster or fighter would be more effective in HotU - at least, I had far less issues with specialists than jacks-of-all-trades (truth be told, I'm not a very good build optimizer).<br/>\n<br/>\n So... I suspect a compromise would effectively \"split\" the build. Up to 20-ish, the BAB + equipment + necessary physical combat feats wouldn't damage the character so much, but from epic territory onwards, it might very well be a liability. I'd have to run two different characters, almost, and since I plan on going all the way... I entertained the possibility of taking Shadowdancer levels instead but the entry level is harsher, even if SD's have good options for more defensive casting.<br/>\n<br/>\n Maybe an alternative, if I *really* want to go with some measure of melee ability (and the thought is fading fast after all this) for lower levels and pre-shapechanging, would be to skip the character's flavor weapon (and take a Feat better spent elsewhere), and go with FW/MW/GMW's, possibly aided by Keen, True Strike, Bull's Strength and Cat's Grace. Earlier Touch spells could also replace it. These could leverage (once again, at earlier levels) the character's lack of Clerical-like buffing, specially when coupled with AOE \"controlers\" like Negative Energy Burst or self-contained invisibility/concealment spell family.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, I believe scroll creation will only be a consideration in HotU. The OC does not feature blank scrolls, so it'd be a waste taken early. Meanwhile, wand materials are more likely to drop for Wizards due to Int values (they almost don't need to take ranks in Craft), and usually there are very few limits to having a character expend his spell repertoire and rest every 5 minutes (still, wands are generally created with 50 charges, which is always nice, and they're faster to use than casting the corresponding spell but lack metamagic application). The XP and GP loss shouldn't be much of a hassle for Wands based on mid-level magic, placing the Wand creation feat as a concern but probably not until SoU/HotU.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm still interested in PM and RDD levels; even if I abandon the spellsword, I think a purer spellcaster still tends to gain some things from them, even if mostly added defenses, but will have to look at it further.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Very good clarification, Tyrful.\u00a0 That's the kind of information we need to make a more informed recommendation... so kudos for speedy reply!<br/>\n<br/>\n Alright...<br/>\n<br/>\n Now first of all... OC-SoU-HotU sequence is going to be a poor choice.\u00a0 The sequence should be either OC-HotU or SoU-HotU (recommended), with bridge mods if you have them installed.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n The reason is that your toon will finish about 16-18 from the OC depending on how much you use hench, familiar and/or summons, with 18 the pure solo likely finish.\u00a0 That means when you start SoU there will be zero challenge and your XP from kills VERY low.\u00a0\u00a0 That's why the expansion HotU was designed to follow SoU (that and a distinctly different storyline ala \"adventures of Deekin\") which attains somewhere in the 12-15 finishing level.\u00a0 Even going the OC-HotU route will start HotU off netting low-end XP kills but due to the CRs increasing rather quickly in HotU, eventually you'll begin to experience more normal challenges somewhere around when Ch1 ends and Ch2 begins.\u00a0 Naturally, you can play in any order you like but you probably won't have much fun sprinting through most of SoU and with all the uber gear from the OC, makes an even further anti-climactic experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, regardless of which route (OC first or SoU first), your final level will be around 28 give or take a level or two.\u00a0 By shoving SoU into the mix, you will only gain a few levels, maybe up to 30-32 at best due to the anemic CRs in HotU for such a high-level toon.\u00a0 Hence, I would recommend designing a Level 28 build which may be a bit lower in actuality depending on how much you use additional support (hench/summons/familiar) during battles.\u00a0 In that eventuality, design your last few levels (approx 26-28) as \"throw-away\" levels since you may not even realize them.<br/>\n<br/>\n With 28 levels to schedule, those pre-epic sorc levels will be difficult/impossible to compensate melee-wise since BAB will be very low.\u00a0 That means not only will your AB barely hit anything (not until the uber weapons appear in Ch2 HotU anyway), but your APR will be hard-pressed to reach 3.\u00a0 Forget about 4 APR altogether, not without several fighter-type levels pre-epic.\u00a0 Plus, your anemic BAB will also affect the polymorph AB and APR which you will depend upon to get you out of jams when the sword/dagger/mace/whatever won't hit enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n Another issue with a mid-epic arcane build is casting failure.\u00a0 You can use Still Spell for most spells but that means you will be locked out of other useful metamagic (like Extend, Empower, Maximize) when forced to use stilled spells.\u00a0 Both armor and shield will have an effect on casting failure.\u00a0 There is some gear that will eliminate most of the casting failure but who knows when it will become available.\u00a0 For at least part of your progress (before RDD levels, if you choose to follow that plan), heavy plate and tower will be tough to manage with your relatively low STR allotment.\u00a0 Autostill Spell is beyond the scope of a Level 28 build.<br/>\n<br/>\n PM benefit is really only an issue vs. DevCrit threats, which do not exist in any of the campaigns.\u00a0 By sticking with a decent starting CON, Toughness, some +CON gear and Empowered Endurance, your caster's HP pool will be large enough to absorb the occasional crit damage.\u00a0 That's what the recipro shields (Death, Elemental, Mestil's) are for... kill enemies while chugging heal pots.\u00a0 An arcanist's concealment potential is also very good so when combined with damage soaks like Stoneskin/Premonition getting hit regularly is actually a GOOD thing.\u00a0 Imagine Tenser or Iron Golem surrounded by recipro shields and pre-buffed fully!\u00a0 Pretty scary.\u00a0 The only real danger are archer/slinger mobs but they will typically fall to any Fort save offensive spell rather quickly.\u00a0 IMO, PM will merely dilute your casting prowess and provide an AC boost that is not needed.\u00a0 BTW, Expertise DOES work in all the campaigns so it can exploited for up to a +10AC bonus.\u00a0 Something to consider.<br/>\n<br/>\n Your choice is really either spellsword (focusing on melee feats with some complementary buffing and offensive casting) or a primary arcanist with enhanced casting who can melee with just about any class weapon equally well but not particularly dominant and depending on magical defenses/shields to control and cause damage by just standing there casting and swatting.\u00a0 In the latter case, you may find that your toon will need to toggle through Improved Expertise-Expertise-No Expertise during a single battle to find a good AC that allows the enemies to receive damage but not so much that your sorc cannot heal fast enough due to flanking crits.<br/>\n<br/>\n A spellsword would be something like a human, half-elf or dwarven Ftr/Src/RDD (really the only way to grab enough combat feats).\u00a0 A dedicated caster, however, would probably include a Tumble class like Rogue or Monk and more racial options.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Another option for a spellsword (and most likely a stronger one) would be a Bard/RDD.\u00a0 You'll still need Still Spell with armor/shield but can bolster the AB woes using bard/curse songs in combination.\u00a0 Plus the skill set will be much better, easier to manage and UMD will open up all that sweet monk gear among its other benefits.\u00a0 If you've forgetten, I'll remind you... the effects from bardic singing CANNOT be dispelled. ;)\u00a0\u00a0 In HotU, Deekin can sing well, but he cannot curse.\u00a0 And he will not respond during combat to commands very well.<br/>\n<br/>\n Though the OC does not provide blank scrolls, the large bones used to craft bone wands will drop, so any arcanist that can win skill check Craft Weapon vs. DC 13 can craft wands for spells up to Level 4.\u00a0 You are correct that Wizards typically have an advantage finding bones with their elevated INT level but with a modest investment in the weapon skill combined with equipping +INT gear and a pre-buff of Fox before fighting skels, plenty of large bones will drop for sorc and bard, as well.\u00a0 Craft Weapon does not need to be trained.<br/>\n<br/>\n Ummm... I like the pixie familiar best if you have no rogue around. On most servers, <em>Find Traps</em> spell has been nerfed to do only THAT action: find traps i.e highlight them on the screen... not disarm them.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi and thank you once again, HipRedux.<br/>\n<br/>\n I haven't had a lot of time today to ponder on the build except on my way to work, and since I'm packing up for a weekend away with family, that leaves me with even less time. However, I did think about it and as usual, still remain undecided.<br/>\n<br/>\n I liked the Bard/RDD suggestion, though... As I said initially, I was going for a Sorc/PM/RDD build (I've already left PM behind) but the RDD would be around level 7. I need to confess that I don't really care for the wings, and also at first, was reluctant to take a \"full\" RDD as it didn't fit the character's concept. However, while the full bonuses for a B/RDD might be worth it (even with wings, gah), is it better to take, say, 18 Bard/10 RDD and sacrifice a Bard epic feat? Or go instead with Bard 23/RDD 7 (bonus Bard feat and no wings, yay)?<br/>\n<br/>\n I have a custom made module to test character builds (in truth, it's a signpost in the middle of a small forest that levels you up once per touch). I tried a 30th level character (23 B/7 RDD), ending with the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n STR 18 (14+4RDD)<br/>\n DEX 14<br/>\n CON 16 (14+2RDD)<br/>\n INT 14<br/>\n WIS 8<br/>\n CHA 22 (14+Great Charisma+Level point distribution)<br/>\n<br/>\n Curse Song<br/>\n Lingering Song<br/>\n Expertise, and Imp. Exp.<br/>\n Combat Casting, and Imp. C.C.<br/>\n Craft Wand<br/>\n Empower/Extend/Maximize/Still Spell (*later changed, see below)<br/>\n Epic Toughness I (*later changed, see below)<br/>\n Great Charisma I<br/>\n<br/>\n For a strict 28 level build, I'd wager 18 B/10 RDD would be the \"ideal\". I tried something like:<br/>\n<br/>\n STR 22 (14+8RDD)<br/>\n DEX 14<br/>\n CON 16 (14+2RDD)<br/>\n INT 16 (14+2RDD)<br/>\n WIS 8<br/>\n CHA 22 (14+2RDD+Level point distribution)<br/>\n<br/>\n Curse Song<br/>\n Craft Wand<br/>\n Empower/Maximize/Still Spell (*Extend didn't seem as useful)<br/>\n Toughness (*the bonus' nicer than a static 20HP)<br/>\n Expertise, and Imp. Exp.<br/>\n Scribe Scroll<br/>\n Lingering Song<br/>\n Combat Casting, and Imp. C.C.<br/>\n Not too certain about other feats, however: Martial Weapon Proficieny (for nicer weapons), Lasting Inspiration (looks great), or even Epic Prowess (is a +1 to all attacks really noticeable?).<br/>\n<br/>\n I don't have the full specifics now but this second version was hardier. I think taking 10 Bard, 10 RDD, then 8 Bard levels was also better than my first try, a straight 18 Bard and 10 RDD.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for the initial stats themselves, I wanted a higher STR and DEX for combat. Didn't invest much in STR as I knew RDD would help it grow. The initial 14 CON will probably improve my survivability if I'm to be in the thick of combat. The INT 14 was really to splurge on skill points (Perform, UMD, Concentration, Spellcraft and Tumble went over 40, and I also had enough to invest in Persuade), and the added +2 after full RDD gave me even more 10 levels to spend on the Bard side of things. A 14 CHA was comfortable, and made better with the RDD boost and the incoming character points. Not sure if it'd be worth it to drop STR and DEX by 2 and 1, respectively, to boost CHA one more point.<br/>\n<br/>\n Apologies if I'm not saying much more right now, but I'm really out of time today and out for the weekend. Hope to have something else to show if I get time to think on this. Thank you once again!<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That's why when anybody has questions about casters, I usually leave that for casting experts.<br/>\n<br/>\n I know single-player isn't your thing, but you owe it to yourself to experience firsthand why everybody is always praising the Aielund Saga. It really is as good as we all say. Sands of Fate is not a waste of time, either.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Utility designers characteristically have cutting edge resources at hand so tend not to concern themselves with the problems of legacy tech that many of us are holding onto.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n All I can say is, it is still on my agenda, but awaits the confidence of an adventuring spirit, not the spirit that dares the perils of new NWN vistas but rather the one that does not fear all the potential fumbling around trying to reestablish stasis when the overrides clash.<br/>\n<br/>\n - - - - - - -<br/>\n<br/>\n Pure spellcasters are the most challenging to play under most situations (unknown creature SR/immunities and save levels, limited resting, dependence on some party tank to buy casting time, etc.) but can also be the most fun for that exact same reason.\u00a0 For most all content, I've eventually tried a high-level rog/wiz unless it becomes clear the magic level is just too high to waste my time.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The Sands of Fate is old enough that it must surely use an older version of CEP, and the same is probably true about the Aielund Saga (but check its page in the vault to be sure). I remember playing both way back when I had a single-core AMD CPU.<br/>\n<br/>\n In Aielund, you have to wait to rest again either 5 real-time minutes or 5 in-game hours, I forget which. In Sands of Fate, you don't have that restriction, but whenever you rest, several hours pass in-game.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
