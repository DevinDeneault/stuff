It's a Spellsword Bg build for Arelith, and I've never made a Bard focused build before, so I could use some help getting started. I was thinking something like, 15 Bard, 10 Fighter, 5 Bg. I'm open to changes and suggestions, as well as letting me know what spells I should take that would be best for my class.</div>"
