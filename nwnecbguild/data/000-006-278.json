      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hail again, mighty guild!<br/>\n<br/>\n I have been without internet for some time, but not without building, that's why I'm in a posting frenzy as of late.<br/>\n<br/>\n This build was made thinking of Viconia DeVir, the drow priestess from the Baldur's Gate saga. She was an evil assassin who was often scorned just for being drow, to which she responded with violence. She was very frail, but incredibly smart. The idea here is to combine Cleric buffing godliness with Monk Wisdom AC and custom attack progression with a Kama (or better, TWO) and Assassin Death Attack damage (and UMD) for the ultimate swift killer machine. You can buff your AB, come in invisible and just unleash death at your opponents.<br/>\n<br/>\n Her HP are awful and saves are bad too, true, but a true Assassin doesn't fight toe to toe unless she absolutely has to, nor should she have to roll many saving throws if she's careful enough. She uses many forms of Invisibility to strike swiftly and without mercy. Trickery domain is chosen for that purpose. Potions should also be a part of your combat strategy as a kind of HiPS. So you buff with an invisibility spell, come in, kill some or everyone, then drink a potion if things get nasty, rinse and repeat. The DC to the Death Attack is only average, but should paralize mages and some sneaky types. Against meleers, she will rely on her high AC from Monk Wisdom AC and high DEX, Concealment due to II and 10 attacks per round with two Darkfired, GMW'ed and Keened (if you have access to scrolls) Kamas aided by Divine Power and Divine Favor to ensure she deals more damage than she takes. INT, CON, WIS and DEX gear should be in your high priority list, but you can count on buffs like Cat's Grace and Endurance combined with the excellent Aura of Vitality spell to make sure you can reach the cap in your physical stats. Divine Trickery should help with trap skills and locks.<br/>\n<br/>\n Another downside is that, being a Drow, she has XP penalty ALL HER LIFE. Can be delayed by going Monk 1 at level 17, but from that point on it's inevitable.<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, here is the Avatar of Swift Death:<br/>\n<br/>\n Alignment: Lawful Evil<br/>\n<br/>\n Playability: 2-40 PvM<br/>\n<br/>\n Cleric(16), Monk(2), Assassin(22), Elf<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 8<br/>\n DEX: 18 (32)<br/>\n CON: 6<br/>\n WIS: 16 (18)<br/>\n INT: 16<br/>\n CHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n Elf: (Hardiness vs. Enchantments, Keen Sense, Low-light Vision, Skill Affinity: Listen, Skill Affinity: Search, Skill Affinity: Spot, Sleeplessness)<br/>\n 01: Monk(1): Two-Weapon Fighting, {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}<br/>\n 02: Cleric(1): Domain War, Domain Trickery<br/>\n 03: Cleric(2): Weapon Finesse<br/>\n 04: Cleric(3): WIS+1, (WIS=17)<br/>\n 05: Cleric(4)<br/>\n 06: Cleric(5): Extend Spell<br/>\n 07: Cleric(6)<br/>\n 08: Cleric(7): WIS+1, (WIS=18)<br/>\n 09: Cleric(8): Ambidexterity<br/>\n 10: Cleric(9)<br/>\n 11: Cleric(10)<br/>\n 12: Cleric(11): DEX+1, Knockdown, (DEX=19)<br/>\n 13: Cleric(12)<br/>\n 14: Cleric(13)<br/>\n 15: Cleric(14): Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br/>\n 16: Cleric(15): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br/>\n 17: Monk(2): {Deflect Arrows}<br/>\n 18: Assassin(1): Weapon Focus: Kama<br/>\n 19: Assassin(2): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br/>\n 20: Assassin(3): DEX+1, (DEX=21)<br/>\n 21: Assassin(4): Armor Skin<br/>\n 22: Assassin(5)<br/>\n 23: Assassin(6)<br/>\n 24: Assassin(7): DEX+1, Epic Weapon Focus: Kama, (DEX=22)<br/>\n 25: Assassin(8)<br/>\n 26: Assassin(9)<br/>\n 27: Assassin(10): Epic Prowess<br/>\n 28: Assassin(11): DEX+1, (DEX=23)<br/>\n 29: Assassin(12)<br/>\n 30: Assassin(13): Blind Fight<br/>\n 31: Assassin(14): Great Dexterity I, (DEX=24)<br/>\n 32: Assassin(15): DEX+1, (DEX=25)<br/>\n 33: Assassin(16): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=26)<br/>\n 34: Assassin(17)<br/>\n 35: Assassin(18): Great Dexterity III, (DEX=27)<br/>\n 36: Assassin(19): DEX+1, Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=29)<br/>\n 37: Assassin(20)<br/>\n 38: Assassin(21)<br/>\n 39: Cleric(16): Great Dexterity V, (DEX=30)<br/>\n 40: Assassin(22): DEX+1, Great Dexterity VI, (DEX=32)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 196<br/>\n Skillpoints: 269<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 21/27/32<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9, Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +2, Poison: +6<br/>\n BAB: 24<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 39 (melee), 36 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 35/35<br/>\n Spell Casting: Cleric(8)<br/>\n Alignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\n Disable Trap 43(48), Hide 8(19), Move Silently 8(19), Open Lock 4(15), Search 18(23), Set Trap 27(40), Spellcraft 42(45), Spot 43(49), Tumble 40(51), UMD 36(35)<br/>\n<br/>\n No similar builds in the search engine.

That will free up one more assassin level for +1 to death attack DC and an extra 1d6 damage. If you take the one level of monk at lvl 5 or later you will get the stealth skills you need for assasin as class skills. <br/>\n2 x 16 and 18 for starting stats is ambitious, but I know where you're coming from.   <br/>\n<br/>\nDivine trickery gives a +9 skill-bonus.  Even so, I'd like to see better stealth ranks.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your trap skills are for PvM with vanilla traps:<br/>\n43 ranks in disarm trap give +48 with 16 int and synergy bonus from set trap. It is a \"take 20\" skill, so at lvl 40 you will always be able to recover epic traps (DC 68). Only problem is that it is overkill since you can get +2 from fox's (or +6 from capped int) and +9 from divine trickery. If your target is to recover deadly traps (max recover DC 46), you will only need an effective rank of 26<br/>\nThe DC to set epic traps is 65. With take 20 and buffs, you will be able to reach 73, or 69 if you only use divine trickery. With capped dex you will reach 75. So you can also save some skillpoints here.<br/>\nSince only rogues can detect traps with a detect DC higher than 35, you will not be able to detect epic traps (DC 43). For normal traps (deadly and lower) the highest DC is 22. Search is not a take 20 skill. You will need 21 (effective) ranks to be sure to detect these traps immediately. 23 is overkill, especially when you factor in the buffs you will have up.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>The closest one is Mick Dagger's Dark Moon Agent, but he doesn't get the Cleric goodies this one gets.

Better AB than my Shadow Priest build by 2 points. 65 Fully Buffed!<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the suggestions to save up skillpoints, I loved the catch of one more Assassin level, which will cost a few skillpoints and make it so that I need to play her differently from level 1 to level 16, when she becomes a proper Monk / Assassin. Still, noone has ever had trouble leveling a Cleric, not even an 8 STR 6 CON Cleric. Will do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nInvesting in Stealth skills is not something I'd do. They give something you can already attain through the use of Invisibility spells from Assassin, Cleric and from potions. I tried dropping Spellcraft and cutting down on trap skills (except Set Traps) and still didn't come close to capping them. Only by abandoning traps entirely would I be able to cap stealth. IMO Traps are more important because invisibility already does for you the same thing that stealth would, so unless True Seeing has been modified, I'd stick with trap skills. Besides, in reality, both are just options, you can still KD and kick butt pretty efficiently without resorting to either stealth or traps.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll wait for other suggestions and if nothing comes I'll post the tweaked version shortly. Thanks for the input, brother!<br/>\n<blockquote><div>Assasin quote: I don't fight - I kill! </div></blockquote>\n\nViconia: I kill, but if I have to fight, I will!<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Where I play, IKD makes virtually no difference, but, if it does where you play, then go for it. On WoG, 2 AC is more important than anything. Monsters there tend to have really competitive AB and sub-par AC. Discipline scores are good, but here is how I see it: I'd rather not use KD against monsters that will probably resist it (Bugbears, Orcs, Ogres, etc..). For those, Darkness will do. KD is to have an option to disable mages, and for that IKD is not needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, if you want IKD, there is something else that can be done which is a more viable tweak. You may go Cleric 16 Monk 6 Assassin 18. You lower your DA DC, lose 3d6 Sneak Attack, but keep Armor Skin and get IKD AND 2x Monk Speed (Plus +1 AC for Monk 5 and +1 AB if you go Cleric 16 Monk 4 pre-epic, but then you'd have to drop Spellcraft altogether). An about even trade IMO. Then that feat can be Improved Critical for your Kamas.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
