      "content": "<div>Is this possible? I'm already planning a second run-through of <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">A Hunt Through the Dark</span>. It stipulates that you must take BG by level 8 (although I have not tested this) and you must take Elf (you can take subrace Drow to get bonuses to CHA and INT). The earliest I could get it to work for an elf in the CBC is lvl 9. Is it possible to get it down to 8 somehow?\u00a0</div>"

If you combine Bard4(max) with a Full BAB class you can get it earlier. 3 lvls of a full-BAB class to be precise.

AHTtD has some outstanding qualities but also some absolutely awful ones.

It's not AHTtD that stipulates this at all; it's the \"Blackguard\" module that does. I've got so many games on the go I'm getting them mixed up. Thanks for solving my problem. <br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my G3125 using Tapatalk<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>"

If your character ends at lvl 8 and doesn't have enough xp to get that first lvl of BG, you can always use a Console command to level up, just to pass that obstacle.</div>",
