It's ambitious too!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not super familiar with these classes but, suggestions to try to help:<br/>\n<br/>\nWould like more HP. I read this comment from Kail some time ago and try to get as close as I can (sometimes I miss the target by about 50hp, but the main thing is being able to tank enough damage to stand in melee)<br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>Kail Pendragon wrote (</strong><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/toughness-called-shot-why-all-the-love-t515384.html#p1272%5Bb\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">toughness-called-shot-why-all-the-love- ... ml#p1272[b</a>]):\u00a0<br/>\nI[/b]n general Toughness is not a bad feat (eventually equivalent to 2 epic feats) to have although it's not high on my priorities. It's a good way to bring HPs up to a desired mark (at lvl 40 for me it's 400 HPs for those involved regularly in melee without being absolute melee specialists, 300 for casters, 500 for dedicated meleers).</div></blockquote>\nBoth Bard and Sorcerer have terrible HP rolls.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe a starting Str of 16, Cons 14 and Int 14 could put you in the right direction achieve what you need. +40 hp and +43 skill points is worth dropping 1 Str for I think. You could even drop Int to 10 and put Cons to 16, it might be worth imputing the numbers to see what each looks like before you make a decision<br/>\n<br/>\nI think squeezing a third class in would be good.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nWould be great to have Blackguard for the bonus to saves /martial weapon foci / heavy armor proficiency and possibly Divine Might in the build but you would need to take power attack and cleave is the downside and the build is somewhat feat starved already. If you take BG, a Bard 13 / BG 3 / Sorc 24 split might be good<br/>\n<br/>\nFighter would also be tempting for +2 bonus feats as well plus heavy armor / martial weapon proficiency, with two levels. Can be taken epic for +2 great strengths or pre epic for +1 AB and extra combat feats/allowing you to have martial weapon foci. You'd get a 20% exp penalty but in a PW it won't matter as much. Bard 14 / F 2 / Sorc 24 split.<br/>\n<br/>\nMick also has just taught me about a trick with the ranger class. If you take a single level epic, you can use the ranger bonus feat for epic weapon focus or epic prowess. Bard 13 / R1 / Sorc 26 would be what I'd do if you did that. Bard 13 I think has level 5 bard spells so I don't think you'd lose a lot?<br/>\n<br/>\nWould like more AB if possible (you've tried pretty hard I can see!), this is going to be challenging. UMD is helpful on WoG to access Divine Power and PnP Tensor's<br/>\n<br/>\nAlternatively your classes have tools to lower AC. Taunt to help with hitting enemies. Curse song might be good? I dont know enough to comment but the bonus to hitting things with zero chance of failure would be helpful. Would swap lingering song for this.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIn WoG I have been told not to worry about Arcane spell failure / Auto Still Spell, one can easily socket an item with all those -% arcanist gems (more experienced players pls correct me if I'm wrong)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway its an interesting idea, got a lot of potential I think, with the proviso I'm not a bard/sorc expert at all<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Since you don't take any feats that require 13 INT or better, you should go with STr16, Cha16, Con14, Int12, instead. The final attributes would be the same but you just gained 40 hps. Lasting Inspiration requires 20 Bard levels, so it isn't possible with this class-split &amp; he already has lingering song which extends his song duration to 15 rounds each. Expertise, while a nice feat to have, it's not for this build, we have many more important feats to take, including of course curse song. And btw, your AB is fine for a spell-sword, Tenser's Transformation will make this 43AB instead of 36AB &amp; giving you four attack/round as well. As for the armor, there is both a medium one (or two) &amp; a certain buckler that don't have any chance of spell-failure. It's gonna be 3AC worse than full plate &amp; tower shield combo in total, but that's a small price to pay for discounting four whole feats (the three of them epic) from your build.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Is craft weapon needed?<br/>\nI once picked a morningstar with its name coloured in green...are only these type of items socketable?<br/>\nAfter applying some changes, the build should be as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\nSorcerer(26), Bard(14), Human<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 16 (28)<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 14<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 12<br/>\nCHA: 16 (19)<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Bard(1): Lingering Song, Curse Song<br/>\n02: Bard(2)<br/>\n03: Bard(3): Weapon Focus<br/>\n04: Bard(4): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n05: Bard(5)<br/>\n06: Bard(6): Extend Spell<br/>\n07: Bard(7)<br/>\n08: Bard(8): STR+1, (STR=18)<br/>\n09: Bard(9): Knockdown<br/>\n10: Bard(10)<br/>\n11: Bard(11)<br/>\n12: Sorcerer(1): STR+1, Blind Fight, (STR=19)<br/>\n13: Sorcerer(2)<br/>\n14: Sorcerer(3)<br/>\n15: Sorcerer(4): Toughness<br/>\n16: Sorcerer(5): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n17: Sorcerer(6)<br/>\n18: Bard(12): Empower Spell<br/>\n19: Sorcerer(7)<br/>\n20: Sorcerer(8): CHA+1, (CHA=17)<br/>\n21: Sorcerer(9): Epic Weapon Focus<br/>\n22: Sorcerer(10)<br/>\n23: Sorcerer(11)<br/>\n24: Sorcerer(12): CHA+1, Great Strength I, (STR=21), (CHA=18)<br/>\n25: Sorcerer(13)<br/>\n26: Sorcerer(14)<br/>\n27: Sorcerer(15): Great Strength II, (STR=22)<br/>\n28: Bard(13): CHA+1, (CHA=19)<br/>\n29: Sorcerer(16)<br/>\n30: Sorcerer(17): Epic Prowess<br/>\n31: Sorcerer(18)<br/>\n32: Sorcerer(19): STR+1, (STR=23)<br/>\n33: Sorcerer(20): Great Strength III, (STR=24)<br/>\n34: Sorcerer(21)<br/>\n35: Sorcerer(22)<br/>\n36: Sorcerer(23): STR+1, Great Strength IV, Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor, (STR=26)<br/>\n37: Sorcerer(24)<br/>\n38: Sorcerer(25)<br/>\n39: Bard(14): Great Strength V, (STR=27)<br/>\n40: Sorcerer(26): STR+1, Epic Spell: Epic Warding, (STR=28)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 308<br/>\nSkillpoints: 206<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 18/23/19<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8<br/>\nBAB: 23<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 36 (melee), 23 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 17/25<br/>\nSpell Casting: Sorcerer(9),Bard(5)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nConcentration 43(45), Discipline 33(42), Open Lock 1(0), Perform 16(20), Search 1(2), Spellcraft 39(40), Tumble 40(39), UMD 31(35)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Concentration(4), Discipline(4), Open Lock(1), Perform(2), Spellcraft(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), <br/>\n02: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), <br/>\n03: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), <br/>\n04: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), <br/>\n05: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), <br/>\n06: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), <br/>\n07: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), <br/>\n08: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), <br/>\n09: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), <br/>\n10: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), <br/>\n11: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), <br/>\n12: Concentration(1), Search(1), Spellcraft(1), <br/>\n13: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(2), <br/>\n14: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(4), <br/>\n15: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(6), <br/>\n16: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(8), <br/>\n17: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(10), <br/>\n18: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(6), UMD(7), <br/>\n19: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(2), <br/>\n20: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(4), <br/>\n21: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(6), <br/>\n22: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(8), <br/>\n23: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(10), <br/>\n24: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(12), <br/>\n25: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(14), <br/>\n26: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(16), <br/>\n27: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(18), <br/>\n28: Perform(3), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(10), UMD(10), <br/>\n29: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(2), <br/>\n30: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(4), <br/>\n31: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(6), <br/>\n32: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(8), <br/>\n33: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(10), <br/>\n34: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(12), <br/>\n35: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(14), <br/>\n36: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(16), <br/>\n37: Save(20), <br/>\n38: Save(24), <br/>\n39: Concentration(1), Discipline(18), Perform(1), Tumble(10), <br/>\n40: Concentration(4), <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWith CON capped, she should reach 548 HP (848 HP in iron golem form).

Perhaps Taunt would be overkill here?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could also add aid and bless from potions or a scabbard of blessing for a further +2 AB<br/>\n<br/>\nTo answer your question on gems, there are two types.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have encountered the green type which is the least common, and the old gem system. My experience is these have fixed drop points (ie not random). Only green gems can be socketed in green items. I have only encountered the morningstar that you have also encountered, but I have not fully explored undermountain / underdark yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more common gem are the teal type which randomly drop. These get socketed into teal socketed items, which have a (x) which tells you how many sockets the item has. The maximum sockets is 6 and minimum sockets 1. ie: Socketed Greataxe (2) = 2 sockets<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ranger trick is Mick Dagger's nugget of knowledge I have spread around for general consumption :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

My aim is not to solo ALL the major bosses in this server, I could be happy if I could finish Rary/Critwall/(and if possible) Drow areas. I am aware of my limits as a player, I have soloed WDK many times with my Bard/Fight/RDD and only won once; I don't underestimate my enemies, even when they are rats <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" />.<br/>\n<br/>\nI strongly think that Tenser's transf. is not to be used all the times (the 100% arcane spell failure an high price/risk), in fact I previously defeated Vayne and Althea with a Paladin/sorcerer/CT spellsword without using any Tenser and without EMA (I was at level 27-28, I think). <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I died two times each fight, and after defeating Vayne I rested at Law's Forge before facing Althea, and maybe my strategy won't work in the server. If nothing will work, I will be however happy to have tried.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Steps:\n2) Pixie removes the trap and opens the door, while I sneak into and kill the balor on the far left of the wings, he can cast greater dispelling. Dispose of all demons into both the left and right wing through shields, and Tenser;\n4) As long as he is close, dispel all his buffs through a Mord's. He couldn't absorb all my Premonition, due also to greater swordsman's belt, and his HP was drained by acid and fire shields. When he has been badly wounded, cast a time stop and two IGMS (not empowered). This should end the game with him, not allowing casting of heals or using of potions.\nI have killed her three times in a row using only a mords (without the breach) and Bigby failed on the first time in only one attempt.I point out that I rested at Law's Forge between Vayne and Althea's fights, but maybe a more skilled player can do the work without resting.I am aware that this is a difficult plan, but I have already implemented it and I think it can work another time.\n</details>\n\nI can opt to replace toughness with craft wand, this has helped so much with the drow as, with the bard build, I continuously casted haste and improved invisibility to be able to \"slay and run\".<br/>\nI will stock on some Leomund's to be able to safely pass thorugh drow and Rary area safe....<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, due to RL, I don't have enough time to level her now into the server, but I'll do it as soon as possible. In the meanwhile, I'll try the fight with Vayne and Althea in the offline module, and let you know...as of now, I humbly thank you all for your precious support and advice! ;)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thank you for your advices on building this PC ;)<br/>\nI have created her with the PGCC and leveled her to lv 33; as, however, I gave her only the greater swordsman belt, and +3/+2 weapons and rings, I still have to go to some areas (Dragotha's one as well, so I will understand which armor she is treasuring) to take down all major bosses and to obtain the most needed boots/cloaks/amulets! Will let you know of her progress!<br/>\nI didn't take the craft wand feat, as of now. I used it a lot against drows with my Bard/Figh/RDD, and I would like to try new strategies and not to heavily depend on wands. This will imply to wait to face them until level 40, when she will take epic warding.<br/>\nHowever, if I would have to rebuild her, I would surely replace toughness with silent spell or still spell: extend does not work with attack spells (e.g. IGMS, ice storm), and I could widen my arcane arsenal and raise the flexibility of this build.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if I won't be able to finish drow's area (but I am confident), I will level her into the server....<br/>\n<br/>\n@ Orion: I can share some advices and some tricks I have learnt, unfortunately (but also luckily) I have yet to understand how to play perfectly a character like this one.<br/>\nI found myself very comfortable with the sorcerer spellsword's playstyle. Even if sorcerers are troubling to level at low levels, later on they blossom and become very strong.<br/>\nSorcerers can help you face unplanned circumstances, as you can cast almost each spell in every moment. Besides, in my opinion maximum flexibility means many tricks to learn ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have enjoyed your druid DS playthrough, and I'm sure you'll find yourself comfortable with arcane casters!<br/>\n<br/>\nSome little advices from my experience:<br/>\n\u00a0- the shadow shield spell, especially when extended, can help you make room for amulets (+CON/+saves/+....) ;<br/>\n\u00a0- WoG has some items that can help you cap charisma;<br/>\n\u00a0- always have Bigby 6 spells at your disposal, they can help defeating wizards (I don't know how the fight would have been without a Bigby on Althea);<br/>\n\u00a0- an interesting strategy for a battle with mages is to use a scroll of silence and sneak to a mage, and knock him/her down, he/she won't be able to do anything (of course, Althea has some scrolls to counterattack and it is immune to KDs so I don't advise doing this against her). Silent spell feat can help a lot, increasing flexibility and avoiding to be \"disarmed\" by another caster;<br/>\nI have found in WoG offline module that in Rao's temple (or Heironeous one in Greyhawk, don't clearly remember) there are \"Silence\" spells scrolls that can used by paladins (strage, as this is not a Paladin spell); <br/>\n\u00a0- darkness + ultravision combo is quite useful, however with some bosses in WoG (e.g. Althea/Vayne) it's like having a big flashing arrow into the top of your head, saying \"target here, you ...\".<br/>\n\u00a0- craft wand feat can be quite useful during Tenser's, when you are not able to cast spells. Useful wands with this character can be made with spells as Haste/Improved invisibility/Identify/True strike/Invisibility/Darkness/Ultravision/Find traps/Keen edge/Elemental shield/Lesser spell breach/Wounding whispers/war cry.<br/>\n\u00a0- Invisibility has often been, for me, an alternative to greater sanctuary when escaping from melee foes (I leave greater sanctuary for mages). As you cast stat buffs as empowered, you have room for 3-4 invisible uses;<br/>\n\u00a0- my favourite strategy when facing threatening foes that don't melee (e.g. liches, demi-liches), is to have in my bag a 2-handed weapon (I love halberds) and cap STR + bless weapon + holy sword. My sorcerer/pally/CT has 30 STR, meaning 1d10+15+5 (greater magic weap) + 3d6 divine damage (this latter cannot be resisted).<br/>\n\u00a0- You can sneak through traps and closed doors through your pixie (she has improved invisibility that make her avoid battles);<br/>\n\u00a0- Be ready to change spells on quickslots if needed (even if it is a nuisance):when fighting wizards such as Althea, you will want to have time stop/mords/bigby/empowered an normal IGMS in the same row, preferrably into the middle of the bar so it is quicker to click on them; <br/>\n\u00a0- Capping stat (INT/STR), even when playing a spellsword, can be quite useful as you can increase the number of spells at your disposal. In the above fight my charisma was 19; increasing it to 22-23 (for example, with a +4 ring in WoG) would have added 1 sixth spell, and to 28 a lv 9 lv spell, that is one more turn of time stop and IGMS to almost kill Althea safely.<br/>\nThis can help saves, if you want to build a Sor/Pal.<br/>\nThis is the main reason why I stubbornly want EMA in this build.<br/>\n<br/>\nI take this exercise as a little brainstorming, so others who are much more keen with spellsword builds can correct/add if there is something wrong (so I can learn something new).<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.: one of my funniest moments with Althea was with my Sorc/Pal/CT, as she casted Bigby 9 and immobilized me, then (I don't know why) a Mords (maybe to dispel my buffs), that dispelled also Bigby's and allowed me to escape from her!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I have not mastered the counting of rounds (I want to understand fully the mechanic, as they are crucial for each playthrough) but I found out that, if I click on cast TS during the third attack, the PC immediately casts TS after it, without her doing a single move (healing).\nThis strategy worked two times, another time I died due to a too early epic warding activation, and early finish of effects....\nLuckily I choose, in previous fights, to keep level 1 and level 9 slots, in case I would need them for Lolth....\n</details>\nOk, I am so happy that this build has succeeded the testing, promoted for server!

Belt, which will both relieve the need to swap AND free up your Girdle/Belt slot.<br/>\n<br/>\nNice read on your Lolth adventures - that area is top notch for challenge on WoG solo play wise.<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my SM-G955F using Tapatalk</div></blockquote>\nYou mean the items whose name is coloured in teal?<br/>\nWestra has found something in her online adventures....nevermind, I will try to have it in the server: this is great news, as it will avoid the nuisance of changing belt in each fight, and free up three quickslot in the main bar (nice advantage). I fear that I need three gems, one for each damage reduction type...it would be too good to have in only one slot all three DRs...<br/>\n<br/>\nInto the fight with Lolth I used the green socketable morningstar, filled in with the gems I found (keen/str +3/enhancement +3). Keen helped much against Lolth (couldn't use other morningstar due to her elemental immunities).<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you, your previous warnings led me to equip as many heal potions and Leomunds as possible; however, Leomunds only worked in drow area, and not in demonweb pits and related areas.<br/>\nThis is the second time I defeat Lolth and her minions without devastating critical, but the first playthrough (bard26/figh4/ rdd10) was easier as I spammed haste and improved invisibility wands, and had lasting inspiration, and a capped 50 strenght....now I understood how resource draining are the demonweb pits.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, I have read some posts into the WoG forum, where DM Raine strongly recommended (if not prohibited) to avoid fights in areas, due to the fact that the next adventurer would have found twice the enemies (previous ones + new spam). If my understanding is correct, that means that the invisibility + run away strategy (without returning to clear the area) is to be considered only as an exception to avoid suicide missions. Is that true?<br/>\nIn my playthroughs, offline modules, I have almost always fought the enemies near me or that can see me, so to be prepared for server play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll make an example just to make the question clearer:<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Northern Critwall, area \nIs this behaviour compliant with the server rules?\n</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
