Could this PC still benefit from Weapon Finesse?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCase 2:\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe above PC does not have anything which grants ability score bonuses, so his strength is higher than his dexterity. While in combat he is dealt strength damage (temporary), and his strength becomes lower than his dexterity.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\na.) Would Weapon Finesse become active?<br/>\n<br/>\nb.) Would it be immediately after the strength reduction (while still in combat)?</div>"

If the PC is wielding a Longsword, even if he has the feat, it won't apply.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this answers your questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!\u00a0</div>",
