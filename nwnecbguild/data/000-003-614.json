One will want to put the AC up if you wish to tank dev crits for the party, as this reduces the chance of a crit by to reducing the enemies chance of a successful threat roll.<br/>\nWith \"undispellable\" high caster level buffs this will be a huge party favorite and has enough punch to solo very well.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the environment I play-test my builds in Auto-Still III is not necessary as there are practical ways around it if one puts a little effort in.<br/>\nFor other environments auto-still III is attractive, swap silent for still and change three great Cha's for auto-still x3 if this is desired.\u00a0<br/>\nOne spare epic general feat which could be used for armor skin, or an epic skill focus: concentration, or other feats.<br/>\nOr increase starting Cha to 16 and drop Int to 12 to ending base Cha 32 (which when capped, will grant an additional level 9 spell compared with base Cha 30) at the cost of 43 skill points.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second cleric domain is ideally healing for empowered cure potions, scrolls (and wands if available) which makes you an awesome party tank by being able to heal yourself, summons and teammates very effectively, however this is not allowed in the environment which I play test. If it is available to you and you play this build draft, I would choose animal and healing domains.<br/>\n<br/>\nRole-playing wise, Ehlonna is the goddess of nature, which fits with the animal domain theme. This sorceress is the arch-magus and untiring lawful good protector of her deity.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Sorcerer(38), Cleric(1), Paladin(1), Human\nLawful Good only\nSTR: 14\nCON: 16 (18)\nINT: 14\n\n01: Sorcerer(1): Silent Spell, Power Attack\n03: Cleric(1): Divine Shield, Domain Animal, Domain Sun\n05: Sorcerer(4)\n07: Sorcerer(6)\n09: Sorcerer(8): Scribe Scroll\n11: Sorcerer(9)\n13: Sorcerer(11)\n15: Sorcerer(13): Empower Spell\n17: Sorcerer(15)\n19: Sorcerer(17)\n21: Sorcerer(19): Great Constitution I, (CON=18)\n23: Sorcerer(21)\n25: Sorcerer(23): Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor\n27: Sorcerer(25): Great Charisma II, (CHA=22)\n29: Sorcerer(27)\n31: Sorcerer(29): Epic Spell: Epic Warding\n33: Sorcerer(31): Great Charisma V, (CHA=27)\n35: Sorcerer(33)\n37: Sorcerer(35): Great Charisma VIII, (CHA=31)\n39: Sorcerer(37): Great Charisma IX, (CHA=32)\n\nSkillpoints: 215\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9\nAB (max, naked): 22 (melee), 19 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Sorcerer(9)\n\n\n01: Concentration(4), Lore(3), Open Lock(1), Search(2), Spellcraft(3), Spot(2),\u00a0\n03: Concentration(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Save(2),\u00a0\n05: Concentration(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Save(6),\u00a0\n07: Concentration(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n09: Concentration(1), Search(1), Spot(1),\u00a0\n11: Concentration(1), Search(1), Spellcraft(4), Spot(1),\u00a0\n13: Concentration(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Save(2),\u00a0\n15: Concentration(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Save(6),\u00a0\n17: Concentration(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n19: Concentration(1), Search(1), Spot(1),\u00a0\n21: Concentration(1), Search(1), Spot(1),\u00a0\n23: Concentration(1), Search(1), Spellcraft(1), Spot(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n25: Concentration(1), Search(1), Spellcraft(1), Spot(1), Save(3),\u00a0\n27: Concentration(1), Search(1), Spellcraft(1), Spot(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n29: Concentration(1), Search(1), Spellcraft(1), Spot(1), Save(7),\u00a0\n31: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Spot(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n33: Concentration(1), Search(1), Spellcraft(1), Spot(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n35: Concentration(1), Search(1), Spellcraft(1), Spot(1), Save(3),\u00a0\n37: Concentration(1), Search(1), Spellcraft(1), Spot(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n39: Concentration(1), Search(1), Spellcraft(1), Spot(1), Save(7),\u00a0</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It is unnecessary and uncalled for.<br/>\n<br/>\nOrion, I have enjoyed your posts, and some of your builds.\u00a0 You like to contribute, and I think that is a good thing.\u00a0 But using this as a reason...you could have just left all that out and just said \"I have noticed...\" and yeah, perhaps your right, I dunno. But the rest...yes, you have contributed, been involved, etc, but that in and of itself is not a valid argument imo. It does not add any weight to your argument in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this really is the internet, and having a thick skin is very helpful. I don't think Yunim meant anything posted maliciously.\u00a0 Rather, he is just posting from his experience and opinion.\u00a0 In fact, I put a lot of faith in Yunim's posts, because from a building aspect for perfecting a build, he is usually right.\u00a0 I've learned a hell of a lot from his posts, and I for one am grateful that he posts what he does.<br/>\n<br/>\nI often think he voices what others think but remain silent about.\u00a0 It is one of the reasons I stopped posting, for the most part, about any part of a build - it just seems to lead to trouble. More trouble than it is worth, because I end up spending more time in trying to format it to avoid anyone reacting negatively to it than the actual information itself!<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to help out where I can, and do, but to be quite frank, I think that perhaps we should have two different sections for builds, one PG orientated, and one \"other\" - so as to put a weight on what is important to the build itself at the beginning.\u00a0 I will freely admit that I am a PGer and love running builds that are really well put together (as I have done in the past) because this is how I learn.\u00a0 I want to see how the build performs in an actual environment, what the parts do, how it works.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't see the suggestion as being negative in this case.\u00a0 He states his opinion, and offers his advise in support of that.\u00a0 It is not derogatory, it is not negatively framed, it is just what it says.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is it \"wrong\" to say \"I don't see the point\"?\u00a0 and then offer support for that?\u00a0 And then he makes a suggestion as to how one could build it to accomplish his view.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this is probably going to blow up and what do I know?\u00a0 I probably shouldn't have even posted this much.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">My comment was meant as constructive criticism, not as an attack on you or your build. One of the main positives of posting builds on the ECB, particularly in the Build Request/Unfinalized Builds section, is recieving feedback from multiple players who have experience in a wide range of environments. If you want to play this build then you should play this build, regardless of what anybody else says. However, mechanically it is weaker than other similar builds such as the ones I listed. In my opinion pointing out how a build can be improved should be acceptable on a forum dedicated to good NWN builds.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the future I will refrain from commenting on your builds Orion, that's probably the easiest way to avoid causing any further disagreements.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
