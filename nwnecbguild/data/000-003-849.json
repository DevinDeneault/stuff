      "content": "<div>Hi all!<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought I'd share an unfinished build I've been working on see, to see what others think RE optimising it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought this might be super fun in parties.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSources of inspiration:<br/>\n- Valerfor's comment on merchant craft builds on PWs (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/viewtopic.php?p=15368\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">viewtopic.php?p=15368</a>)<br/>\n- The 'Red Mage' job class from Final Fantasy I, III, IV, V etc... (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Red_Mage\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Red_Mage</a>)<br/>\n- Red Mage (Wizard 23/Cleric 17) build written by Tengudor_t (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build150360.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/buil ... 50360.html</a>)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"font-size:150%;line-height:normal\">The Eccentric Gnomeish Red Mage Shopkeeper Merchant</span></strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/201907/10759084_fd9704612a870a307671a64838cec106.jpg\"/><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:75%;line-height:normal\">Source: Community NWN Portrait Packs (sorry I can't remember which one I got it from, I have so many)</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lore:</strong><br/>\nPeriarry Zedrick's heritage came from 5 generations of gnomish wizard shopkeepers from the gnomish town of Glurzbib. Crippled by Preezle fever as a child, he never developed an interest in becoming strong or graceful, but the experience combined with his gnomish hertiage instilled enormous reserves of toughness. As he reached adulthood had the bright idea of branching out into Clerical spells to widen the amount of stock his family store could provide. Once he had learned all the spell crafting he could from the Temple of Tyr, he returned back to his natural heritage.<br/>\n<br/>\nApart from running his store, in his spare time he makes potions, crafts wands and scribes scrolls. He will talk incessantly about theory crafting the manufacture of such items to his friends, which would normally be severely offputting, but his extraordinary generosity in sharing such items with his friends to 'try them out' more than compensates. During his clerical training he realised the value of using magic to defend one's self and has developed an interest in combat magic and some ranged weapon capabilities. He encountered a rogue during his journey, and discovered such skills could be valuable particularly when bartering for the best prices, and retrieving cool magic traps for further study.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Strengths:</strong><br/>\nLots of spells! Full wizard spell book and close to full cleric spell book (access to level 9 cleric spells)<br/>\nAble to craft all standard clerical and wizard magical spells plus barkskin and creeping doom (from plant domain). I'm sure he will be well loved by party members even if he is a little 'odd'.<br/>\nAble to craft Time Stop scrolls, amongst others..<br/>\nCombat abilities from cleric buffs (including Divine Power) / Zen Archery. Ranged weapon AB 19 at level 20 (+1AB against larger creatures with small stature)<br/>\nReasonable HP for a caster, 3 attacks per round, ?4 attacks per round with Divine Power<br/>\nExtended spell for Divine Favor/Divine Power / other buffs<br/>\nStill spell allows spell casting in full plate + large shield. Divine Power will help with weight management of this.<br/>\nRogue skill dumps allowing Tumble 40 (+8 AC), Spellcraft 50 (+10 to saves vs spells), UMD 33 modified (to use all scrolls)<br/>\nHigh appraise + high int for maximum selling power<br/>\nCan use Epic Warding spell at level 39<br/>\nSome trap setting skills (Set Trap 15 allows all deadly traps except gas traps to be set)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Weaknesses:</strong><br/>\nVery weak early game, will want to spend most of his time attacking with a sling, casting summons / letting party members fight / and turn invisible if there is any threat to life.\u00a0Weight management issues with Str 6 (will want gear to buff this / Divine Power). A sling combined with Str 6 will generally tickle opponents.<br/>\nAll buffs are dispellable which will be annoying, given how long it takes to fully buff<br/>\nSpell DCs will not be the greatest compared with primary classes<br/>\nSpell resistant enemies will be difficult to solo<br/>\nMelee or ranged damage output will depend on cleric buffs<br/>\nNo monk. (I umm'ed and ahh'ed about this and chose Rogue because it had appraise as a class skill and this guy will want to try to retrieve awesome traps to study in his spare time)<br/>\n20% exp penalty after level 23, not as severe in PWs where monsters respawn<br/>\nMany shopkeeper/merchant builds will sit around levels 20-30, do a level appropriate quest, then craft a whole bunch of items (spending the experience points) and avoid leveling. For this build to function as an effective shopkeeper for both cleric and wizard with one level in rogue and to be able to craft spells up to level 9, he would need to hover around at least level 35. Certain persistent worlds do not have enough epic level content to allow this to be viable (World of Greyhawk, the PW I play, has enough epic content to allow this build to be viable).<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Other builds with Wizard/Cleric/Rogue class combinations:</strong><br/>\nMystic Fencer (Rogue 13/Cleric 12/Wizard 15) <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build151262.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/buil ... 51262.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Some other Wizard/Cleric builds in the Tapatalk forum:</strong><br/>\nThe Magical Master (Cleric 15/Wizard 23/Monk 2) <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-magical-master-cleric-15-wizard-23-monk-2-t515401.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the-magical-master-cleric-15-wizard-23- ... 15401.html</a><br/>\nAerie, the wingless Avariel (Cleric 19/Wizard 19/Monk 2) <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/aerie-the-wingless-avariel-cleric-19-illusionist-1-t2354380.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">aerie-the-wingless-avariel-cleric-19-il ... 54380.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Other Shopkeeper/Merchant/Craft Magic builds that I could find\u00a0</strong>(having all three crafting feats)<strong>:</strong><br/>\nAncilla (Bard 20/Cleric 17/Sorcerer 3)\u00a0 <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build128675.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/buil ... 28675.html</a><br/>\nSorcerer 21/Cleric 14/Harper Scout 5\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build202887.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/bui ... 02887.html</a><br/>\nPlanar Guardian (Cleric 16/Sorcerer 23/Monk 1)\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build117498.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/bui ... 17498.html</a><br/>\nDarkInfernoo's Dwarven Wizard 28/Pale Master 2\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/request306777.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/bui ... 06777.html</a> - scroll down to the bottom<br/>\nBodyknock Glincle (Wizard 35/Fighter 2/Rogue 3)\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/boddyknock-glinckle-wizard-35-fighter-2-rogue-3-t2269098.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">boddyknock-glinckle-wizard-35-fighter-2 ... 69098.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Non-serious Merchant build</strong><br/>\nThe Epic Scholar (Bard 1, Wizard 39) <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-epic-scholar-bard-1-wizard-39-t2326949.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the-epic-scholar-bard-1-wizard-39-t2326949.html</a> for Light Scrolls, Wands and Potions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Other notes:</strong><br/>\nIn World of Greyhawk, a\u00a05th level Harper, in addition to Bull's Strength and Cat's Grace, can also create potions of Invisibility, Ultravision, Haste and Clairaudience/Clairvoyance.

With the current build he could craft the same potions (albeit more expensive), and they buffed potion crafting to scale as much as possible with levels, and I'd have to drop Epic Warding and some spell casting abilities as well.\u00a0 (or keep epic warding lower my cleric levels but I want to be able to craft Lvl 9 scrolls of course!)<br/>\n<br/>\nRE Crafter advancement I understand your point. If the goal is to be able to craft all magic up to lvl 9 with cleric and wizard then the minimum character level requirement would be 34, level 35 if I take that level of rogue. it's kinda tricky. Certainly WoG has lots of stuff (as far as I've heard) to keep level 40 characters busy and challenged. I'll find a way to word it into the weakness of the build I think. He shouldn't totally useless in party combat though.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery good point RE 18/16 Int Wis distribution. That added a further 10 skill points for no loss! Pumped up set trap to mod 15, fair enough, not sure why I was holding back. Agree with toughness/empower change, he's not wanting to tank damage, no thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nI considered dropping blind fight, but was thinking if he used Tenser's / Shapechange spells, or was using Divine Power/other buffs to attack it would come in handy so I left it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also scaled back the amount of investment in the heal skill. As a cleric he will have the Heal spell, and he will be able to scribe scrolls of heal, so just enough ranks to be useful in party combat / keep summons alive should be enough.\u00a0 I also tweaked the spellcraft leveling. Both changes would allow larger skill dumps when that first rogue level is taken.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Edit: </strong>I also adjusted the epic feat progression, so that Greater Intelligence feats were taken more often earlier, for an additional 9 skill points.</div>"
