Slightly different split (Monk 11/ Wiz 2/ AA 27) and stats (14 Str helped early on), but ending up with the same AB. Stealthy where possible, run'n gun where not.

It would allow you to keep elf without xp penalty (though I seem to recall that doesn't feature in BSK), and also gives free longbow proficiency. Bard, of course, is a 3/4 BAB class, and iirc AA requires a BAB of +6, so it would need 8 levels before AA could be taken. Then you could use 3 more Bard levels for skill dumps and have 29 AA levels. Clearly, Bard would be more more singing than anything else, but maybe...?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's only a thought atm, but I wanted to see if anyone thinks it might be worth pursuing before I spend ages doing something pointless (and no, I need no comment on that bit, thank you very much).<br/>\n<br/>\nCrap, I've just remembered, I'd have to take 2 more of those Bard levels pre-epic, so that gives a BAB of 27 and only 1 level of Bard in epic. Still do-able, but more of a strain.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I personally haven't gotten that far yet where it becomes a problem with a Champion of Torm build, though I've only recently hit level 15. I have seen a Paladin 9/Wizard 1/Arcane Archer 30 build online so I believe a Divine Archer can be successful. However I'm not sure to what extent that is the build or the item quality on BSK.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nEnd-game gear can look like +10 Enhancement, 2d12 Magical, Massive Criticals 2d12, Keen, etc. How much of that archer's performance is the server-specific item quality and how much is the Divine Might damage it's hard to say without something empirical.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nKeen to see the outcome though.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
