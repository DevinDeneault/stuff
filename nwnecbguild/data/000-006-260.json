      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Not many moons ago i presented to this guild my first Shadow Warrior that went by the name of \" <strong>Dark Assailant</strong> \", since that time i continually evolved the build in my mind over and over again, trying to make it better. Long story short, this is what i finally settled upon. In comparison to the first Shadow Warrior thiis has a significantly improved attack bonus and much, much better saves than the original. While this is by no means a replacement for the worlds like (WoG) who change shadow dancers in a positive way (duration of shadow evade/ epic shadow lord summon), it can be safely considered, simply as, stronger. You will find this build relatively easy to level-up since you begin strong and remain strong throughout the whole process, by thirteen level you are a full-blown weapon master and not long after that you acquire the (in)famous HiPS, that will make you a true hunter. My weapon of choice is the Halberd and for a very good reason after\u00a0 the 1.69 patch were finally the weapon damage types were fixed, since his damage is almost impossible to resist, while it delivers absolutely devastating criticals upon your enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\n Overall this is a full plate warrior with many evasive features that normally a strength-based build would not have. For the full explanation please refer to the first shadow warrior's build, since repetition is not my forte,<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Dark Assailant</strong> =&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2352638/THE-DARK-ASSAILANT-FTR-16-SD-16-WM-8#.VAN3LmP5fhQ\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/23 ...

Both builds could add them with a little tweaking . If it's simply builder preference or server requirements that's cool but could be noted for the casual observer. I didn't know the dual damage had been fixed, good to know.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I have made many builds with Devastating Critical and to incorporate it here isn't hard at all either. You can simply replace the save booster feats with the feats for Dev. Crit. and get it, however it is to my belief that a Weapon Master least of all should have that as a priority. This is due to the excessive amount of damage a well made Weapon Master can deliver to his foes that it will go to waste for some part at least. I have also found that in most of the PW's out there, Dev. Crit. is either forbidden or so significantly altered that it doesn't worth to take it (WoG being an exception to that) but in no case i found WM's altered, so people usually request/play a good WM and have fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now for this build, the focus was to increase as much the defense as i could and so i did, sacrificing a modicum of power for a much more stable build that can not only hit hard but take it too, or better say it, avoid it in most cases. And as for the offensive power of it, i believe is already high enough that one can forgive that it does not have that all-star feat that dominated NwN's life for years. The option however is there should you want it.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks for the input,<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
