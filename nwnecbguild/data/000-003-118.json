I'm looking for a level 30 Melee palemaster build, I'm decent at building myself and I'm aware that a very strong split is usually Bard/Fighter/PM but I'm not sure what the starting stats nor the levels should be of each. I'm very capable of switching stuff around to suit my own needs so just knowing the necessities and the base with a list of must-take feats is fine for me. I'd prefer to have enough skillpoints for bluff if possible as well, unless it messes too much with the base stats.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, I can take 3 gifts that boost a base stat by 2(due to Arelith's gift system) and I'm not worried about the leveling process, but if there is a better split I'm not aware of or a better end-result I'm very open to suggestions.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I should have been more specific for the proper advice!<br/>\n<br/>\n PvP for certain.<br/>\n<br/>\n In terms of DEX or STR I don't particularly mind but I would prefer to self buff if possible - Arelith is full of magic and it seems to dominate the PVP scale and I assume if I were to build in preference for melee with low magic my weakness to mages would be even higher. (Bard and Curse song are also welcomed!)<br/>\n<br/>\n Would it be too much for you to give a few lists of types with the selected feats? I bet that's a lot of work and I feel bad just asking but I assume I'll end up experimenting with a bunch of different build paths with PM in general since it's such a broad scale.<br/>\n<br/>\n A bit irrelevent but maybe more helpful information for you could be this\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Gifts\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://wiki.arelith.com/Gifts</a>\u00a0(perhaps for the future or just for you to know - I don't usually see a point in not taking three gifts despite the slower leveling if only because of the possible late level changes, as the ECL only lowers experience gained and doesn't affect total level)<br/>\n<br/>\n I know this probably still isn't much help, but here are the listed Pale Master changes(which are not many)\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Pale_master\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://wiki.arelith.com/Pale_</a><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Pale_master\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">master</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I did just discover that Necromancy on Arelith was buffed again without my realization, and supposedly you can take Epic Mummy Dust with just 15 palemaster levels on NWN? The spell itself states that you need to be able to cast 9th level spells but a note on the wiki mentions you only need 15 PM which I find interesting, and apparently on Arelith you get access to these: <br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Spell_changes#Necromancy_changes\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://wiki.arelith.com/Spell_changes#N ... cy_changes</a><br/>\n<br/>\n Also thank you very much for your help, just posting that build alone lets me figure out a lot to the Bard/Fighter/PM staple. I might try to swap it around to be more dexterity based just in case for a chance at dodging some epic spells at least with reflex.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for your question though, to be honest the server is mostly full of wizards/clerics/standard bard/fighters and monks with a small handful of weapon masters after. There's a whole list of how many people have logged in during the last few months and what classes they are if you're interested in seeing it.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">The problem with a dyed-in-the-wool bardic necromancer is that it can't get Autostill which means either robes/no shield or suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortunes (or rather, misfortunes) trying to cast arcane spells.\u00a0 Even going wiz/sorc, Autostill is still not an option open on Arelith due to the Spellcraft prereq.\u00a0 I doubt you'll achieve an AC worthy of shrugging off attacks without plate/tower.\u00a0 That's one of the reasons the build I posted settled for the crit immunity and a few intrinsic touch attacks within a Level 30 constraint.<br/>\n<br/>\n A PM 15+ will end up a poorer melee candidate due to the PM levels needed in pre-epic, effectively gimping the BAB too much to be able to exact reliable damage.\u00a0 I'm guessing they play those sort of builds (15+) on Arelith more like a caster than a spellsword and even less as pure melee.<br/>\n<br/>\n ...unless Arelith has somehow altered the prereqs of Autostill feats.\u00a0 But I wouldn't be privy to that information.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
