      "content": "<div>I really like the level 20 build. Its a pretty solid spellsword for level 20 with up to level 6 wizard spells, crit immunity, Pale Master AC immunity, and a good HP score.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nCaster level of 6 is probably the best one is going to get with 10 levels of PM. That being said, there is a work around. Scribe scroll is very strong here, as scrolls don't have arcane failure from armor and in vanilla NWN they don't take into account caster level of the creator of the scroll. So in vanilla NWN, a scroll of ILMS is the same whether one has a caster level of 6 or 20. Heaps of great scrolls to scribe such as improved invisibility, lesser spell breach, lesser spell mantle, greater stoneskin, ILMS, Bigby's 5 and 6 etc etc. One can see this spell sword could be quite a handful!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly thing I would change is to fit Blind Fight in the build somewhere. I would swap it with Great Cleave if you are limited to level 20.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI like it, well done!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe full epic build I think suffers from low BAB progression in the first 20 levels, so the ending AB of 33 ideally should be higher, in addition the caster level is low, so you end up having a build which will be a bit weak offensively in late epic levels, compared with other builds who might have an AB of 40, 45 or 50 or caster levels of 26, 35 or 40. I'd suggest working on the pre-epic level split to improve the BAB, by shifting quite a few of the PM levels to early epic levels and try to increase the fighter levels pre-epic. Or an alternative might be to drop about 10 PM levels (PM 16 is probably more than enough) and change them to Wizard levels. This will give you more caster spell power. In addition wizard spell progression is 33% faster than PM spell progression, which will give you more space to increase the pre-epic fighter levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy Fighter/Wizard/PM build (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/viewtopic.php?t=2355140&amp;p=16416\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Arcane Dwarven Dreadlord</a>) took a Fighter 12 / Wizard 4 / PM 4 split pre-epic which resulted in a BAB of 26, and I was able to get the ending AB with a lot of effort to 40, making it a reasonable spellsword build, extremely strong defensively, and enough offense to kill things. The caster levels were honestly not the best but I could cast level 9 wizard spells and scribe Mord's Scrolls, Bigbys, Great Spell Mantles and Time Stop scrolls all really nice, also improved invisibility / mind blank / keen weapon / flame weapon etc are all very nice spells to have. Craft wand and ILMS is very cheesy which I never ended up doing but when I make a dedicated arcane caster I'm sure that is something I will want to try. One thing many may not know is that Mordenkainen's Disjunction and Time Stop are 'Verbal only' spells, meaning there is no chance of arcane spell failure from wearing heavy armor or using a tower shield.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrizzled_Dwarflord also made an excellent <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build202355.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fighter/Wizard/PM build</a> which uses the same pre-epic and level split as I did. It doesn't have dev crit and my build's AB is 2 higher, but it has Auto-Still Spell 1-3 instead. That being said I would question the worth of Auto-Still spell with only 10 caster levels at most. I'd suggest more value\u00a0would be obtained by taking Craft Wand instead for ILMS spam / II spam, in tough environments one will get dispelled so having heaps of charges on these wands makes such builds super strong. Also crafting magic doesn't take into account caster levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway hope my comments encourage you rather than discourage, I love the fact you're creative, trying something different, and the level 20 build is very nice!\u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>Totally encouraged, so no worries. I've been thinking about these ideas for years, but it's only recently that I've actually tried to cook rather than simply eat others' fare. I really wish real life allowed for enough time to fully consume all of these 40 level feasts around here (instead of just sampling them).<br/>\n<br/>\nHands down, your Arcane Dwarven Dreadlord is a beast. Most people would be hard pressed (or repulsed) to think of that dwarf as a muse, but I'll go there. And TBH I didn't put much thought into my full epic version above.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI've never been a fan of either Brew Potion or Scribe Scroll. Playing almost exclusively in XP-limited modules like the OC, I never wanted to sacrifice my \"hard earned\" experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nI completely agree on BF, I thought I had put it in there pre-epic. What probably happened was a mix of creating for lvl20, adding to get to lvl40 (with some finagling to get DC), then removing epic levels for cut and paste reasons. I think this just helps to highlight what needs to happen when one's goal is optimizing for a specific level.</div>"
