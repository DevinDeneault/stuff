      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The build is inspired by the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/speed-caster-sorceror-36-monk-3-paladin-1-t515365.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Speed Caster</a> by WhiZard:<br/>\nThe point of the build is that the Monk speed feat overrides the speedcap of +50% and let you stack speed from different spells (mass haste, expeditious retreat) so you can move with an insane speed. It takes 3 levels of monk to get the feat. (See the speed calculations in WhiZard's post)<br/>\nWhiZard also uses one level of Paladin for the Divine grace feat to get a save boost from the high charisma. In my build I use 2 levels of BG for the Dark blessing feat with the same effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn important question is when to take the monk and BG levels. If you spread them out evenly, you will have skill dumps for optimum skill investment. If you build for lvl 40, it is best to take those classes late for the same reason.<br/>\nIf you level up your character in a normal way, playing the levels, you may want to get Monk 3 early so you can zoom around at high speed during leveling. The same goes for the save boost from BG. But then again if you multiclass a sorcerer too early you will lack the spellpower necessary for carefree levelling.<br/>\nThis character will not stand and fight like a tank in full armor with expertise on, it is supposed to RUN, so I have dropped Discipline and left Tumble at 15, just enough to avoid AOOs when running around.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvil Speed Caster:<br/>\nSorcerer(35), Monk(3), Blackguard(2), <br/>\nHuman, Lawful Evil alignment<br/>\nPvM lvl 1-40 , PvP 21-40<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 10<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 16<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 10<br/>\nCHA: 18 (38)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Sorcerer(1): Toughness, Extend Spell<br/>\n02: Sorcerer(2)<br/>\n03: Sorcerer(3): Silent Spell<br/>\n04: Sorcerer(4): CHA+1, (CHA=19)<br/>\n05: Sorcerer(5)<br/>\n06: Sorcerer(6): Empower Spell<br/>\n07: Sorcerer(7)<br/>\n08: Sorcerer(8): CHA+1, (CHA=20)<br/>\n09: Sorcerer(9): Maximize Spell<br/>\n10: Sorcerer(10)<br/>\n11: Sorcerer(11)<br/>\n12: Sorcerer(12): CHA+1, Spell Focus: Necromancy, (CHA=21)<br/>\n13: Sorcerer(13)<br/>\n14: Sorcerer(14)<br/>\n15: Sorcerer(15): Greater Spell Focus: Necromancy<br/>\n16: Sorcerer(16): CHA+1, (CHA=22)<br/>\n17: Sorcerer(17)<br/>\n18: Sorcerer(18): Quicken Spell<br/>\n19: Monk(1): {Cleave, Evasion}<br/>\n20: Monk(2): CHA+1, {Deflect Arrows}, (CHA=23)<br/>\n21: Monk(3): {Monk Speed},  Great Charisma I, (CHA=24)<br/>\n22: Sorcerer(19)<br/>\n23: Sorcerer(20)<br/>\n24: Blackguard(1): CHA+1, Great Charisma II, (CHA=26)<br/>\n25: Blackguard(2): {Dark Blessing}<br/>\n26: Sorcerer(21)<br/>\n27: Sorcerer(22): Epic Spell Focus: Necromancy<br/>\n28: Sorcerer(23): CHA+1, Great Charisma III, (CHA=28)<br/>\n29: Sorcerer(24)<br/>\n30: Sorcerer(25): Great Charisma IV, (CHA=29)<br/>\n31: Sorcerer(26): Epic Spell: Epic Warding<br/>\n32: Sorcerer(27): CHA+1, (CHA=30)<br/>\n33: Sorcerer(28): Great Charisma V, (CHA=31)<br/>\n34: Sorcerer(29): Great Charisma VI, (CHA=32)<br/>\n35: Sorcerer(30)<br/>\n36: Sorcerer(31): CHA+1, Great Charisma VII, (CHA=34)<br/>\n37: Sorcerer(32): Great Charisma VIII, (CHA=35)<br/>\n38: Sorcerer(33)<br/>\n39: Sorcerer(34): Great Charisma IX, (CHA=36)<br/>\n40: Sorcerer(35): CHA+1, Great Charisma X, (CHA=38)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 344<br/>\nSkillpoints: 135<br/>\nConcentration 43(46), Hide 5(4), Listen 24(23), Spellcraft 40(40), Tumble 15(14), remaining skillpoints 8<br/>\n<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 36/37/32<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8, Mind Effects: +2<br/>\n<br/>\nBAB: 20<br/>\nAB: +20/ +17/ +14/ +11 (melee), +19 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked): 12<br/>\n<br/>\nSpell Casting: Sorcerer(9)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nSkills by Level:<br/>\n01: Concentration(4), Spellcraft(4), Save(4), <br/>\n02: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(5), <br/>\n03: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(6), <br/>\n04: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(7), <br/>\n05: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(8), <br/>\n06: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(9), <br/>\n07: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(10), <br/>\n08: Spellcraft(1), Save(12), <br/>\n09: Spellcraft(1), Save(14), <br/>\n10: Spellcraft(1), Save(16), <br/>\n11: Spellcraft(1), Save(18), <br/>\n12: Spellcraft(1), Save(20), <br/>\n13: Spellcraft(1), Save(22), <br/>\n14: Spellcraft(1), Save(24), <br/>\n15: Spellcraft(1), Save(26), <br/>\n16: Spellcraft(1), Save(28), <br/>\n17: Spellcraft(1), Save(30), <br/>\n18: Spellcraft(1), Save(32), <br/>\n19: Listen(22), Tumble(15), <br/>\n20: Concentration(1), Listen(1), Save(3), <br/>\n21: Concentration(1), Hide(5), Listen(1), Save(1), <br/>\n22: Spellcraft(4), <br/>\n23: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(1), <br/>\n24: Concentration(3), <br/>\n25: Concentration(2), Save(1), <br/>\n26: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(3), <br/>\n27: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(1), <br/>\n28: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(1), <br/>\n29: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(1), <br/>\n30: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(1), <br/>\n31: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(1), <br/>\n32: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(1), <br/>\n33: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(1), <br/>\n34: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(1), <br/>\n35: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(1), <br/>\n36: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(1), <br/>\n37: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(2), <br/>\n38: Concentration(1), Save(4), <br/>\n39: Concentration(1), Save(6), <br/>\n40: Concentration(1), Save(8),<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Then you get a sorcerer with high defence that can stand and fight and shrug off most attacks from lesser creatures.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Evil Speed Caster is designed to move very fast. To be able to do that it has the Monk speed feat (Monk 3) that removes the +50% cap on speed and let you stack speed effects from sources like Monk speed, Expeditious retreat and Mass haste. The Monk speed feat does not work if you wear armor or shield of any kind. And AC is not a priority here. If you (despite your maneuverability) end up in a situation where you need AC, you may use your Epic warding.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Silence is primarily there for the list of spells that cannot be extended, which are quite a few.<br/>\n<br/>\n The build has meta magical feats for two reasons. One is the improved effect meta-magic adds. The other is added slots. <br/>\n And like you know this is the beauty of the sponaneous caster: Eg: If you need fire spells, you can cast Firebrand normally from all your level 5 slots, silenced from your level 6 slots, empowered from your level 7 slots, maximised from your level 8 slots and quickened from all your level 9 slots. You can virtually keep casting that spell all day long if you want.<br/>\n And you can choose to do likewise with any other spell in your book without any preparation.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I start out with pure Sorcerer to get the spellpower that makes levelling as caster possible without lagging behind on spell progression. <br/>\nI prefer to add Monk and BG only when spellpower is up and running.<br/>\nMonk and BG are only there to add extra speed and saves. This is not a spellsword and it is not some evil version of the \"Exalted Sorceress\". ( Of course I do have an \"Infamous Sorcerer\" build lurking somewhere in my folders.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI do take Tumble, but only enough to avoid Attacks of opportunity when running past an enemy. I could have achieved that by taking Monk already at level 12, but IMO that is too early to slow down the spell progression. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd believe me, a pure Sorcerer is a very strong character, at least after level 8 or 10 or thereabout, so there is no reason at all to rush the multiclassing. The multiclassing even has a price when I take it this late. The 5 levels of other classes delay the point where the build becomes immune to the dispels. It also lowers spell penetration to such a degree that I often want to take the Spell penetration feat instead of Quicken spell.<br/>\n<br/>\n@ Stag<br/>\nI checked a screen dump. She was actually at level 24 when she killed Scar; Sorcerer 20/Monk 3/ BG 1.<br/>\nAs for Gnome, you are right.

Both questions were answered clearly and make good sense. I completely forgot that going Gnome would cack up the skill points - I was only thinking of the feat I'd lose at character creation. And since this guy seems pretty skill-starved to begin with, I can see why that would be a terrible decision. If I want a Gnome Sorc badly enough, I'll probably just solo-class it at some point in the future ~ or put a build request in the appropriate forum.\u00a0 ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... squee! I've found my next toon for a run-through! I'll build the Evil Speed Caster as-is and watch the carnage unfold as I zip across the screen. Now I just have to decide which modules to play him through...<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nBTWs <em class=\"mention\">@Stagmeister</em>\u00a0 - I'm still loving the War Singer of Gwynharwyf (she's 24 and just murderizing everything in the Underdark ATM), but it's no secret that I've got a bad case of restart-itis.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I would take Spell penetration instead of Quicken spell. It may seem a bit odd in a build with 35 caster levels, but during the 20s after multiclassing, you temporarily lag a bit behind on caster levels. You can of course fix it with casting once more if you fail the penetration check (as I did), but there are a lot of creatures in there with a SR that a pure caster normally will beat.<br/>\n<br/>\nSk\u00e5l!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Also, how do you manage to not die every 15 seconds with no meat shields? </div></blockquote>\nThese are general challenges for any Sorcerer and this one is not so different. <br/>\nEarly on the Sorcerer is a weak character with few spells and low defence. Up to level 8 -10 it is very hard to level a sorcerer without some kind of meat shield. I have tried it, and it involves a LOT of running. What I usually do at lower levels is to use a familiar with either high AC and HP, like the Pseudo dragon, or one of them with 5/+1 DR and regeneration, like the mephits and the Imp. But here I used the Eyeball. I also spawn the best summon I can afford, and I say so because the summoning line of spells is not my first choice once I get access to a new level of spells. Buying scrolls of summon animal is a good option when available. But after a while these summons just become too feeble.<br/>\nAt some point with this character I picked the spell Animate dead and buffed the skellie with Stone bones and what not. It served well as a tank for some levels. But that was more of a RP choice.<br/>\nBefore your enemies start to get +1 weapons, Ghostly Visage and 5/+1 defence works well. <br/>\nAt level 8 and 9 when you start to get level 4 spells, Stoneskin and Improved invisibility make you very durable. At level 10 Firebrand is your new \"big stick\", and you start to have enough slots and spells to choose from.\u00a0 At this level range you can try going solo, at least for shorter periodes. Extended Haste or Expeditious retreat make you hard to catch.<br/>\nWhen you feel confident with solo play, you can pick a utility Familiar like the pixie. It can take some punishment, but is not a tank. So the main reason for taking it is to have rogue skills available.<br/>\nNot that you really need them. Magic missile is a good can opener. And a well placed Fireball can open many containers simultaneously. If you find a trap you cannot pass, you can always summon a Badger and have it run across it, and so on. And if you cannot detect the traps, you have spells that help you soak up damage. You always have the Knock and Find trap spells, but you don't have to learn them, just buy some scrolls if you don't like the methods above.\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>In Bracksworth you can buy some boots that give permanent speed improvement, like permanent Expeditious retrat. That makes running a lot easier. But you probably cannot afford them early on.\n</details>\n\nWhen you play the Aielund, you probably use the EMS hak. It changes several spells, and may be a bit unfamiliar if you have played casters elsewhere. Some of the changes I like, but others not. But it is definitely possible to play as a caster, also with EMS.<br/>\nOne thing I experienced was that when I buffed the main character, the Familiar got the same buffs automatically as a bonus.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

My spell picks are fairly different (which I'll post verbatim a bit later, just for S's and G's) but with some commonalities. I love that Wizard's Sidearm xbow -- that was actually the first fruit of my Continual Flame labors, harkening back to an earlier post.\u00a0<img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" />\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout to hit the road but will come back to this later to post my spell picks, talk about my playstyle with them, and (hopefully) get some feedback.\u00a0<br/>\n-Noc<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Here's the rundown:<br/>\nAt Level 14<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Cantrips</span>: All<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Level 1</span>: Color Spray (<em>still stuns trashmobs quite a bit</em>!), Expeditious Retreat, Identify, Magic Missile, Shield<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Level 2</span>: Cat's Grace, Cloud of Bewilderment (<em>marginally useful at this level, admittedly</em>), Death Armor, Gedlee's Electric Loop (<em>outdated, replacing next level</em>), Web<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Level 3</span>: Flame Arrow, Negative Energy Burst, Scintillating Sphere, Slow<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Level 4</span>: Elemental Shield, Elemental Shield, Enervate (<em>to nerf casters, which admittedly almost never show up</em>), Evard's Black Tentacles<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Level 5</span>: Bigby's Interposing Hand, Cloudkill, Mestil's Acid Sheath<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Level 6</span>: Circle of Death, Tenser's Transformation<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Level 7</span>: Finger of Death<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have the limitless Magic Missile xbow, Boots for Haste 1/day (plus a ring w/10 charges for backup!), and various direct damage/AOE spells through weapons, wands, and the like.\u00a0<br/>\nThe usual rotation looks something like this: Start the day with extended Expeditious Retreat then run around looking for things to kill. Once I spot something, I'll usually cast extended Shield and Cat's Grace for AC buff then attack with Neg Energy Burst &gt; Web &gt; EBT &gt; Circle of Death &gt; Scintillating Sphere and/or Gedlee's until they're all fried. If fighting a single attacker, or some groups, I'll go the reciprocal damage route by <em>skipping </em>Cat's and Shield, then popping Death Armor, Elemental Shield, Mestil's Acid Sheath, and Tenser's Transformation.\u00a0<br/>\nBut these routines vary, and every fight still feels fresh and different since I have gobs of spells to choose from. Once I level up I'm going to try your spell suggestions and see how that affects my playstyle.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I went back to an old save game (I try to remember to save before each level-up) but I didn't save before the last one, so I took a BIG step back to level 12 to reset those spell selections, just on a lark. It's a totally different game running around with a skellie chieftain and my familiar (I went back to the captive Pixie for rogue skills since I had been traveling with Ronan prior). It took a few minutes to get used to, but I have to say, I really like this iteration. Totally different playstyle, totally different vibe, and still a MONSTER. That skellie is surprisingly viable once I get him buffed up (and totally useless before I do).\u00a0<br/>\nThe only minor changes I made are that I kept <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Expeditious Retreat</span> (I mean, I <em>am </em>an Evil Speed Caster, after all) over <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Ray of Enfeeblement</span> at 1st level, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Death Armor</span> at 2nd, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Scintillating Sphere</span> over <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Fireball </span>and <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Negative Energy Burst</span> over <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Lightning Bolt </span>at 3rd (I have 2 fireball\u00a0 items anyway), and <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Elemental Shield</span> over <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Ice Storm</span> at 4th. That was a hard decision, but I'm addicted to the reciprocal damage plan, especially now that I have <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Stoneskin</span>. All other spells are precisely the same as your outline.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you put (under a spoiler) where to find those in Aielund? I don't think I've run across a pair of perma-hasted boots yet. I've just cleaned out the Assassin's guild and am ready to head south-southwest to put the smack down on some things living outside the city walls.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<br/>\n-Noc<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
