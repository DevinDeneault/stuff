      "content": "<div>Hi guys,<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking to play my first cleric in a custom environment and i'd like some pointers. The Thay PW has some modifications to spells which i'll list.<br/>\nI'm after a cleric PvM build, preferably with the animal/plant domain. the max level on the server is 25. I'd like it to be Elf or Human, either down the zen archery or melee route, whichever is going to give me the easiest time up to level 10 where most characters float.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nSpell and Class changes:<br/>\nAbility buffs are a flat +4 and last 1 minute/level.<br/>\nImproved Invis is 1 round/level.<br/>\nMagic Vestment is 2 minute/level<br/>\nAll summons are also 2 minute/level.<br/>\n<br/>\nShifter gains wildshape 2/3/4 at levels 2/3/4 respectively, humanoid at 5 and toned-down versions of undead/construct/dragon shape at 6/7/8.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nRealistically the max item enhancement is +4, there is no penalty for multiclassing. As an interesting aside there is the potential for 9th level clerics to become shifters, i'd be curious to see what you guys think about a cleric/shifter/monk split? I see its asking a lot for 25 levels though. Thanks for your time.</div>"

      "content": "<div>I can think of several approaches:<br/>\nPure Cleric so you can be effective casting offensively as well as buffing.<br/>\nFighter 2 and the rest Cleric, so you get free Martial Weapons Proficiency and 2 more feats.<br/>\nFighter 4 and the rest Cleric, so you can also get Weapon Spec and Epic Weapon Spec, but not until level 24, which is why I also suggested only 2 Fighter.<br/>\nMonk 2, Fighter 2 or 0, and the rest Cleric. You get your WIS bonus added to your AC and you get the Monk attack progression on your kama. Definitely add the Fighter levels if you want to wield 2 kamas instead of just 1.</div>",

      "content": "<div>From what you said about focusing in longsword, I take it your wanting a melee cleric. \u00a0So the real question then is how loaded down do you want to be in between castings of divine power/favor.<br/>\n<br/>\nA str of 14 lets you carry 116 lbs while a 16 lets you carry 153.<br/>\n<br/>\nFull plate weighs 50 lbs and a tower shield weights 45. \u00a0Thats 95 lbs for plain common gear. \u00a0Some magical or rare materials lower the base weight.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if strength enhancing items are common, you might be able to get away with a 14 str. \u00a0Or if bags of holding are easy to come by, then you may be able to go lower still.<br/>\n<br/>\nMyself, I'd probably go with 16 just to give you some leeway in carrying stuff without having to make sure you were always buffed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sure Valefor or Max will come by sooner or later and give you some better info.</div>"

      "content": "<div>The weapon focus seemed to make sense, once i've taken the metamagic feats i'd need to get the most out of my spellbook i'm not sure what other feats to take, I guess zen archery for reasonable plinking at a distance? At a max level of 25 would the difference between a melee 15/16 lvls of cleric and a pure cleric caster in terms of casting for PvM be pretty substantial? Thanks for the advice, taking 16 str 16 wis left me with 10 dex and con with 14 int, I think thats a good place to start?</div>"

I'd start with 16 STR and WIS too. 3 bumps to WIS, the rest to STR. Fighter at lvl 1, then Cleric for a while and possibly 1 more fighter sometime and a lvl or 2 in a tumble class.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo melee buffer.<br/>\n<br/>\nSent fra min SM-G950F via Tapatalk<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>"
