These shuriken are upgraded every 5 levels<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>What I am looking for</strong><br/>\nI am looking for a dex build with as many SD levels as possible. Must have the WF/EWF/IC shuriken feats. Would be nice if it could also be feated for rapiers.<br/>\nWill mainly be played solo so that needs to be taken into account as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanking you all in advance<br/>\nPiggy<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The shuriken was mainly to take advantage of the ammo generator thingy that upgrades every 5 levels. I think this can be scrapped though. will try something else out instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your time though<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Once I wanted to make a build that uses shurikens, but it remained only a concept in my mind. I would take rogue or assassin to get sneak/death attack, and at least 21 levels of Ranger for BoE against sneak immunes. The third class would be shadowdancer here, and it's not bad because HiPS would help you to land sneaks.<br/>\nBut that's it, I don't know if anything useful can be made from this.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT:<br/>\nI made a little search, and here is something with roughly the same class distribution as described above - <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-bane-crusher-ranger-23-rogue-16-sd-1-t515517.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Bane Crusher</a> from Maximilian Kane. It's a melee toon and does not have exotic proficiency, so a few tweaks are needed, but it can be a good base to start.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
