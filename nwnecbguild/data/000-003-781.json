Invis (on a Wand, of course) makes this build on par with a Shadowdancer's HiPS on WoG, due to the Cooldown.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssassin instead of Rogue to avoid an XP penalty as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm calling the build the Arch Assassin (just my personal peeve - you can call it whatever you like!)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

But anyway...<br/>\n<br/>\nYou mention using light armour rather than robes, but in that case you'd immediately lose the Monk speed you want. Sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nI assume, when you're talking about 4APR, that will be dual-wielding, otherwise you've no chance. It would also help if you took kamas as your weapons for the Monk attack progression, but I don't know their utility/availability on WoG.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd iirc, the length a PDA lasts is now determined by Assassin levels, not character levels, so that will give you less than 2 rounds with 9 levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll now quit the stage for folk who know better and more...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Everything else is an attempt to make it more melee-friendly.<br/>\nThe real question here is if it is worth it to only take 28 wizard levels.<br/>\n3 monk levels give the speed feat, tumble, discipline, monk AC (If you want that) and monk attack progression if unarmed or with a Kama.<br/>\nAssassin gives the poison feats, more 3/4 BAB class, most rogue skills, UMD if you need that with a wizard/monk, and a level 9 Improved invisibility (as if you need that with an epic wizard.) The Death attack DC with only 9 Assassin levels suffers even with a high intelligence buffed to the max.<br/>\nMy advice for this wizard build is: Do what wizards do best and cut down on the multiclassing to a minimum.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Monk 6 for improved knockdown. Assassin 9 for improved invisibility. Wizard 25 grants 'undispellability except against Mords / Breaches' but I wish it was higher (Wizard 26 is a bonus feat level, for example)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway AB and HP were big problems when trying to get this off the ground.

Also meta magic and spell foci would have been nice.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nBase AB is 36 with this build with an BAB of 23 which is 7 attacks per round dual wielding Kamas, 8 with flurry, 9 APR with flurry and haste. 300hp.

Invis wands (self created) means the HS and MS are not really important, freeing up valuable skill points for Search and Spot (important, needed skills on WoG).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor really tough foes (WoG bosses) I am leaning on Gr. Sanc, Timestop, and TS if necessary to hit the 60+ ACs.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing able to Scribe scrolls makes this easy enough and viable (TS in the 1st level spellslots).<br/>\n<br/>\nATM, the character is Wiz 4/Monk 1 (at level 5 for MS and HS skilldrop)/Ass 3.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is pretty good, uses mundane Kamas charged with wands of GMW and Flameweapon. <br/>\n<br/>\nShe already has Ambidexterity and TWF.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust need to pick up ITWF.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I am not sure about, is WF, EWF, and other combat feats weighted against more magic orientated feats and Gr. Int.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Epic, only two levels of Monk and 1 Assassin basically for skilldumps and monk speed.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, the CBC will not work with my OpenOffice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI need feat optimization, to get as many as I can, in order to see what fits and what needs leaving out.<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my SM-G955F using Tapatalk<br/>\n<br/>\n<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
