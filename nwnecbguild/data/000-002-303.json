Would it be helpful (to anyone other then me!) to have some sort of listing of the more common abbreviations used in builds?<br/>\n<br/>\n  I know I tend to get lost reading some of the builds and replies to questions about builds when the shorthand starts flying fast and wild.  Though, those who know me, know it's not just the abbreviations that get me lost!!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

But as soon as I remove the BBcode, it edits as normal.  I find this strange but passed it off as another of those browser issues.
