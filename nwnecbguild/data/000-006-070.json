Blind fight is definitely a tweak worth mentioning.<br/>\n Blind fight makes you a better fighter vs invisible and concealed creatures, and when blinded for different reasons. So if that is a common scenario where you play, then take blind fight.<br/>\n The reason why I picked\u00a0PA was that I wanted an extra means to generate damage. This is a dex build with epic dodge. The 20 rogue levels give 10d6 SA. But vs sneak immunes you only have +2 from strength and +6 from WS and EWS added to the weapon base damage. Adding +5 damage brings the damage somewhat closer to\u00a0 what you expect from a strength build, and with a base AB of +45, you can afford to use PA vs many creatures.<br/>\n In a low/mid magic environment with few options to add weapon damage, PA will serve it's purpose. In a high magic setting, all the weapon enhancements will make PA superfluous.<br/>\n I have also spent feats in this build to make discipline compete with what you get from strength builds.<br/>\n I guess you can say that this is a dex build that in some ways emulates a strength build without sacrificing the benefits of\u00a0the dex build.</div></div>",

It is a good suggestion and the end result\u00a0will be\u00a0good.<br/>\n ESF discipline comes at level 36, and before that the discipline dumps come at intervals.

      "content": "<div>Hi Mick,<br/>\n<br/>\n As you may or may not know, this is the only Dex build I've ever played into Epic levels (completing both the OC and SoU/HotU with it), and a delight it has been. However, I'm keen to give it a whirl through Aielund (along with three other builds I'm also giving a run at it - depends on what mood I'm in), thus, I have a few questions, if I may...<br/>\n<br/>\n First, the feats. I've read the discussion above regarding Blind Fight, Power Attack and Skill Focus: Disc, and will have to make some kind of judgement there, but best advice on Aielund is that a high Will save is needed, particularly near the end of the saga, so I have run into a brick wall concerning Iron and Epic Will. Now, obviously I can't have everything, but you've \"been there, done that\", so I thought I'd try to pick your brain as to priorities?<br/>\n<br/>\n Second, the skills. I'm getting myself a bit tied up in knots with what to do. Thinking about the environment, I'm trying to squeeze in some Disable Trap and Concentration (both c18 pts) as well as maxing Spellcraft (also 18), and grabbing minor points in Heal (4) and Open Lock (5). My concern is that I'm spreading myself too thin elsewhere, with Spot dropping to 31 and Search to 18. I'm less worried about taking a hit in Hide and Move Silently (both down to 28), 'cos I'm a bit rubbish at stealth anyway. As well as the spread then looking more Jack-of-all-trades, there's also an issue of when to take the new skills, as they're all more useful early on. My poor, sad little brain is addled (you know it's getting bad when you start dreaming about skill points allocations!), so I thought I'd come to the font of wisdom on such things. That would be you, if you were wondering.<br/>\n<br/>\n I feel like a kid who thinks they've mastered riding a bike, then Dad takes the stabilisers off.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks in advance for your thoughts. (Oh, and I'm posting this via Hip's Guide Filter - just to confirm that it's working!)</div>",

      "content": "<div>You only need Search, Disable Trap, and Open Lock in chapter 1, up to level 9. After that, you will have a Rogue in your party to handle those things. Also, move Rogue 3 to level 5 so you won't have so many levels of not-Rogue in a row, or you'll wind up at level 6 with the skills of a level 3 Rogue. If you take Iron Will instead of Power Attack at level 18, your Will save should be OK. If you don't plan to be stealthy, that's a lot of points you put somewhere else, like Spellcraft and Concentration, with some left over for Lore.<br/>\n An optional idea would be to use daggers instead of kukris, so you wouldn't need Exotic Weapons proficiency. You could use the feat you save to get Luck of Heroes at level 1, Weapon Focus at level 3, and Expertise at level 4.<br/>\n That should be enough to convert this to a Aielund build.</div>",

They have x3 multiplier &amp; they are slashing weapons, so you can \"keen\" them with UMD. 18-20x3 doesn't sound too bad, eh? <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, for a more in-depth answer, you'll have to wait for Mick. <br/>\nGood luck!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Since this will be used on WoG :<br/>\n<blockquote><div>Use Maces or Handaxes or Short Swords instead of Kukris. Less crits, but one size \"bigger\" and 1d6 instead of 1d4. </div></blockquote>\n\nThis will not matter, not in the slightest, as most opponents at higher levels have massive amounts of DR - meaning your base damage for these weapons will be mostly meaningless (with the possible exception of crits).\u00a0 Elemental damage will play a more important role here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in the case of Crits, the Handaxes will of course do more damage here, due to the x3 modifier vs the Kukris x2.\u00a0 However, they are Crit on a 20 (meaning you will need to roll a natural 20 to crit) so that is not going to happen all that often.\u00a0 Kukris, on the other hand, are 18~20 for a Crit, meaning it will happen more often than in the case of Handaxes.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeen will increase the Crit range by 1 here for the Handaxes, but by <em><strong>TWO </strong></em>here for the Kukris <blockquote><div>The <strong>keen</strong> item property increases the critical threat range of a weapon by a range equal to the item's base threat range. In the absence of other modifications to the threat range, this doubles the range.</div></blockquote>\n\nImproved Critical just makes the Kukris even more perverse, and only helps the Handaxes marginally.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what one has to ask here, is how important is critting to the character (build) going to be?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it is a central part of the build, then by all means, go with Kukris.\u00a0 If it is just a bonus, then Handaxes will be fine, and may be preferred.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Blind Fighting, it is a great feat to have on WoG, due to everyone and their uncle, aunt, cousins, and distant relatives all sneaking about - and alot of them make use of invis as well.\u00a0 So Blind Fighting is certainly one of those critical feats on WoG.\u00a0 Due to massive amounts of meta-knowledge that I posses here, I myself would forgoe this in the build, but that is just me (there are ways to compensate for the lack of Blind Fight here, especially for this build).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if going Handaxes, then yes, certainly do take Blind Fighting if dropping Exotic Weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nSkill Focus Disc is not really necessary imo on WoG - there are better ways to deal with KD there.\u00a0 However, one should not totally discard the idea due to Disarm (which does get used against one on WoG, but it is not as prevalent as KD is imo).<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not a proponent of Saving Throws.\u00a0 It is my firm belief that immunites are greater than Saving Throws are, especially on WoG where you will be spammed with abilities that require a saving throw.\u00a0 This means that inevitably you will roll a 1 (and due to how the NWN Engine works, it will happen ALOT!!!!) and you will fail it, regardless of what you have done to pump up your saves.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo imo, LoH is a wasted feat here.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleave is more useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest taking Toughness (and getting the extra hitpoints) instead of reducing Con and getting more Int here.\u00a0 Greater Ruin has been buffed on WoG, and it can do over 400 hps of damage (just one).\u00a0 This is sort of the mark that one always aims for on WoG, so that one can at least survive a hit of a GR (and scramble to suck down that Heal or two before the next one hits!).</div>"
