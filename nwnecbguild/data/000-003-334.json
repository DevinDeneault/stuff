Thanks!</div></blockquote>\n\nHey man!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, it seems to me that you want a little bit too much for this build. Here's what I mean: <br/>\n<br/>\n- AC and survivability means DEX, which can also be AB with Weapon Finesse, so if you had said I want an assassin build with survivability, I would say good, let's try to build it then! However...<br/>\n<br/>\n- Damage output means STR, which is mutually exclusive with DEX, meaning that if you put one point in DEX, it's one less point you put in STR and vice-versa. There are alternative ways of increasing the damage output of a DEX build. those are: WS / EWS, Sneak Attacks, Traps, dual-wielding and buffs. So, you will never even come close to a STR build in terms of damage, but you can have alternatives.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more Sneak Attacks, you'd have to be a Rogue / Assassin, that would also be good because of the skill points. You can complement that with some Fighter levels for some feats and EWS and you have yourself an OK build in terms of damage dealing with good survivability.<br/>\n<br/>\nSupposing you go Fighter / Rogue / Assassin, to get Epic Dodge, you'd need at least 13 Rogue levels, BUT, that would lower your DA DC by a lot. Epic Dodge is great to have in a DEX build, so the question is: would you be willing to sacrifice Death Attack DC for it?<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

Thanks! </div></blockquote>\n\nThat can be arranged.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if you want DA DC, you can go for Assassin 18, which is the highest attainable at a 30th level cap level that grants you a bonus feat. That leaves another 12 levels to be split between Rogue and Fighter. You can do 4 Fighter to get EWS, 6 if you want to have it as a bonus feat, which would leave 6 levels for Rogue, but Rogue 6 and Rogue 4 is almost the same, except for 1d6 Sneak Attack, so I would say the best spread is Fighter 8 Rogue 4 Assassin 18. You'd need to take Rogue 4 Fighter 6 Assassin 10 pre-epic, or even Fighter 7 Assassin 9 Rogue 4 (either is fine).<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll see what I can build when I have some spare time, which is not now. maybe later today I will.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

However, the HP is terrible. There are things you can do to compensate that, like take out 2 points of STR and put in CON and take Toughness instead of Blind Fight (but you can't take it as a Fighter feat, so you'd need to delay a combat feat to attain it in a general feat level. Those two changes will net you 80 HP, which would make it much less terrible than it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"
