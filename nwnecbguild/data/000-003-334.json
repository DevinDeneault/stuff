The downside of me going elf would be having less feats, taking more time to get really good at dualwielding those japanese badboys and the -2 CON. Another downside is the inability to summon extra help (unless I take Linu along my journeys) and I got quite used to that as a rogue, ranger and/or cleric :\\<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and another thing: what would a human or elf (yeah I'm still debating between picking my fav pointy-eared treehugger and the bland human) dualwielding fighter wear? Leather? Or Medium Armor to have decent enough AC but not harm the DEX too much?<br/>\n<br/>\nedit: maybe it doesn't matter if I just pick Elf, because I plan to play this guy all the way through OC, SoU and HoTU. It'll only bug me at lower lvls, but what the hell.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hey dude,<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may have played for a long time, but in your previous topic and in this one, we can tell that you haven't taken your NWN experience into the depth that we have here at the ECB. No offense, but just the fact that you want to dual-wield Katanas tells us that you don't really know a lot about this game, or else you'd know that katanas are large weapons and you receive a higher penalty for doing so. Or maybe you do know, but the OC is SO EASY that you can finish it dual-wielding Greatswords (you can't, just being sarcastic here ), so you just don't care.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can tell you this: NWN is THE MOST COMPLEX GAME EVER MADE! The realm of possibilities for Character building is just INFINITE or almost. I can tell you from experience that the OC represents ZERO challenge for a good build, so if you REALLY REALLY REALLY want a Katana dual-wielder, the OC is probably the place to do it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe power in building strong characters comes from the synergies between the classes, things that you gain from one class that complement the things that you gain from another class. As an example, we can quote Mick Dagger's recently posted Divine Bomber, in the level 20 section. It's SUCH A COOL BUILD! It's a Bard / AA / BG. BG gives him save bonuses, Bull's Strength and Divine Might, AA gives him AB points, which allows him to invest his stat points in Charisma for more DM uses per day and higher damage with the bow. And bard comes in as a requirement for AA, but also brings in the skill points, skill set, the Bard Song and a couple of spells. There are SO MANY SYNERGIES in this build that are VERY WELL EXPLORED by Mick.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe guy you want to make will start with a deficit, he will receive a -4 penalty to each attack in both hands because of the size of the Katana, but NOT JUST THAT!!! He will also need at least 15 DEX to dual-wield (ITWF requires it) unless he goes for Ranger, BUT, being a Katana guy, he will need to be STR-oriented, since Katanas aren't finesseable. Rangers can't wear heavy armor or else they lose their dualwielding properties, so you'll have low AC, even lower because you won't be able to carry a shield, having 2 weapons and all. So, basically, unlike the example I explained above of Mick's build, your build is actually SEVERELY HANDICAPPED from the start because of what you want it to do, which on the plus side can make the OC slightly more challenging.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, what I want to explain to you is this: If you are going to dual-wield, the most reasonable thing to do would be to go for a light weapon, and since it has a DEX requirement of 15, it's probably a good idea to go for a DEX-based toon, but if you want STR, you can do what I'll explain next: I'm thinking a simple Fighter / Rogue / WM who wields Kukris should be able to get the job done with ease, if you're interested. You could go Fighter 10 Rogue 3 WM 7. Start with 16 STR, 15 DEX (13 +2 from Elf), 14 CON (16 -2 from Elf), 13 INT, 8 WIS and 8 CHA. All stat points go to STR. You have 5 stat increases until level 20, so you'll end up with 20 STR. <br/>\n<br/>\nI could build you something if you like the idea, but I want to know whether you are willing to let go of the Katana idea first.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Hard to believe I was ever proud of myself for killing him. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem isn't dual-wielding Katanas <strong>on OC, SoU, HotU</strong>, the problem is just with <strong>dual-wielding katanas</strong> and the way that it handicaps the build.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, if you read my post again you'll see that I said that the OC, SoU and HotU are the place to try things like that if one really wants to, I just don't see why someone would want that! I remember when I first started I had a Ranger / Weapon Master who dual-wielded RAPIERS! He could barely hit anything up until the Underdark in HotU, but the only reason I did that was because I didn't know how dual-wielding worked. After I learned, I would never encourage someone to make a gimped build. I'd rather teach them the ropes so they can learn to make powerful characters, after all, this is the ECB, not the GCB (Gimped Character Builders) <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It really helps to have that kind of attitude if you don't have enough knowledge of the game's mechanics to make your own overpowered characters. <br/>\n<br/>\nI believe you can buy it right from the start at the Merchant Tutorial guy. Don't remember his name, been a VERY LONG time. Now, not only you can, if you swap some feats around and start with WF: Dwarven Waraxe (take Exotic Proficiency and WF at character creation instead of Power Attack and Cleave and take PA and Cleave on the levels where you'd take WPE and WF), you should be able to pick one up in the chest right behind you in your starting room.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one point in Open Locks is for WoG (the server where I play), because there, if you bash chests, there is a chance that the loot will be destroyed with the chest. In the OC, you don't need it. <br/>\n<br/>\nFunny thing about Salvatore, I saw a video of one of his interviews, where he talked about the origin of Drizzt, and how he was a last minute sidekick to Bruenor, but then people started sending letters to the editor asking more about the elf, which prompted him to have his own stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, Bruenor Battlehammer is a VERY POWERFUL GUY, I just don't see him as a Red Dragon Disciple.

Go F/DD or add 2 WM to it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI mostly like the idea of having near 200 hp more than the F/B/RDD build, but the disable trap comes (way) too late imho, and I can take Tomi for that. On henchmen, I know I can rotate between them, but I always like having atleast 2 who I can swap if needed, and those two are Tomi (for traps) and Linu (for heals and buffs). Daelan is strong, but it itches me to go into battle with 2 fighters, I prefer to spread the abilities in combat  I've read that Linu is for ranged combat and buffing, but I kinda enjoy having her right at my side for melee damage...<br/>\n<br/>\nedit: on WM, I've just seen that adding only 2 of them is not really great, either none or 7 lvls to make good use of that class, but that's my inexperienced opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nedit2: on Drizzt, I believe Salvatore meant Wulfgar to be the hero of the series, with indeed Drizzt as a last minute sidekick, but after 3 or so chapters, Salvatore discovered Drizzt would be the star of it all<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

There is not really another class that you can put in there that will give you that much benefit. Rogue gives you Tumble as a Class Skill and UMD (Use Magic Device), which are just THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT SKILLS IN THE GAME. Tumble adds +8 to AC at level 37 (+1 for every 5 ranks in it) and UMD allows you to cast from scrolls. The only two other classes that give you these two skills as class skills are Bard and Assassin. Bruenor isn't an Assassin kind of guy for sure, and Bard could be OK, but it doesn't give you Sneak Attack or Evasion, so basically, you'll be less effective with Bard than with Rogue. Don't think too much of it, though, the Rogue levels could represent that he has had contact with the \"underworld\", or \"shady dealings\" in the past, or just that he is \"street safe\". having Rogue levels doesn't necessarily make Bruenor an outlaw, you know?<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Sword &amp; board is the most boring setup for a player.<br/>\n<br/>\nI say you play something intersting Moredhel, either dual-wield or grasp a two-handed weapon and go to town. King Harbroom had a greataxe, Driiz't had dual-scimitars, Sturm Brightblade will have divine might and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will hardly need the AC of a tower shield if you use a simple thing. Knockdown! You can make them cry with this feat in all of OC/SOU/HoTU and with the extra damage from either dual-wield or a good two-hander they will be <br/>\n<br/>\ndead before you know it. I made a pure barbarian recently and played rapidly SOU &amp; HoTU. I stayed in medium armor for RP reasons too. No full tumble, no shield AC, i had the  Greatsword HArbinger +8 and still 55 AC on HoTU.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey were dead in the first flurry usually and i have Tony's AI inside and i play on HArdcore only. I believe the normal settings are more forgiving, especially without Tony's.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, give him something he can adhere to. Also i believe that we must give Modhere a build that rises to power as early as possible even at the cost of later power.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am willing to help what i can, but i need to know what you want to play first. Find a concept that you really like and let us know what this is. Then we will give you the best.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as it is now max tries all too sincerely to help giving his best, without knowing exactly what you want first.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 coppers,<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I don't mind being a \"boring\" sword and board character, as it fits the usual idea of that one being the hero (and personally I simply cannot play Dragon Age Origins as anything else than a tankwarrior, because if I pick an archer or rogue or something, the feeling of epicness flies out the window). In Morrowind I tend to play the melee type of guy as well, so it's ok for me to play this style <br/>\n<br/>\nYou do make a point with your \"rise to power early\" comment, though. The whole Tumble and UMD feel kinda lost to me if I can select them no earlier than, say, lvl 22.<br/>\n<br/>\nMax, could you possibly redo (or give advice on) your F/R/DD build so I can get certain feats earlier in-game? I was thinking of picking 8 fighter/1 rogue/1 dwarven defender so I can have both the tumble/umd and def stance by the time I enter Luskan.<br/>\n<br/>\nedit: I also fancy sinking the Lockpickpoints into Disable Trap, I bet that won't hurt the build.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hey dude. <br/>\n<br/>\nEvery build is tweakable, you can do that if you want, but I wouldn't. As Valerfor says, you don't really NEED any of that in the OC. I only discovered Tumble gave you AC after finishing HoTU 100 times LOL. The problem with doing things this way is that you would have to drop a feat and you'd lose 1 AB on a build that \"technically\" is already a low AB build, but like he said, Mephistopheles has 32 AC, so it doesn't even matter.  . The only real droppable feats there are: Exotic Weapons and Improved Knockdown. The remaining feats are either requirements for something else (Cleave, Great Cleave and Improved Critical for DevCrit, Power Attack for Cleave, Dodge and Toughness for Dwarven Defender) or VERY USEFUL FEATS (Expertise saves you LOTS OF DEFENSIVE STANCES for the most important battles, KD goes without saying and Blind Fight is ESSENTIAL for all meleers when fighting concealed creatures or when you're blinded. And, this build only has two Rogue levels to spread around 40, so if you choose to take a pre-epic skill dump, you'll suffer later on with the lack of another dump for many levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would advise you to do is this: if you REALLY value playability that much, change the spread. Add more Rogue levels, in which case you don't even have to use my build, you can go with Grizz's Citadel, which is a VERY POWERFUL build that takes more Rogue for Crippling Strike and is WAY MORE PLAYABLE than mine (well, it's way more powerful until level 22, then mine would be better).<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the build:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build249289.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CLICK HERE</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYou can do as you please, it's important that you like your character, but I'm just telling you what I think is best. Sometimes you need to do the exact opposite to learn why it is that I'm suggesting what I am and then you'll start understanding not just the advice I'm giving you, but also WHY I'm giving it to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Just saw your post. Forgot to mention that 724 HP is WITHOUT Defensive Stance. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, not knowing the value of UMD is something very common in beginning players. You don't really NEED to buff up for ANY encounter, not even bosses, so it does kind of seem like overkill (and given the level of difficulty you'll be facing, it SURELY IS ). But, trust me when I say, if you EVER go beyond the OC, UMD will be VITAL. It's one thing to go into a battle with a full plate and a weapon, it's another one to go with a Bless potion, an Aid potion, a Stoneskin scroll, a Flame Weapon scroll, an Improved Invisibility scroll, a Bull's Strength scroll, etc.. In some places, those buffs will mean the difference between victory and defeat. Unfortunately for you, the OC is not one of those. Why don't you give that Diablo module that Valerfor mentioned a try? It's going to BLOW YOUR MIND!<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Characters start their lives with 4 X {Int. Modifier + (class skill points)} at level 1. That's the reason he goes with Rogue first.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Uncanny Dodge is not the same as Dodge. It is a class feauture of the Rogue and some other classes and valuable in DEX builds most of all but a good thing to have anyway. You don't loose your DEX modifier to AC ever.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) You cannot take Dwarven Waraxe at 1st level if you start as a rogue since i believe it has a BAB requirement. Starting as a fighter you could but you will loose many skill points. You can take it later in the build though.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Your character if he is a Dwarven Defender or generally a melee STR-based build should always wear the heviest armour possible. That means Full Plate with a Tower Shield strapped on your off hand.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Encumberance will hardly matter in a STR build. Soon you will be able to carry Tons!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDragon Age Origins, warrior but with a 2-hander for me, i loved that giant cleavers   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me close with another number just for kicks,<br/>\n<br/>\nDrow ARCHmage with 13 AC<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'd love to add it to my NWN portraits list. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to your questions, starting with Rogue is good because of skill points, as Valerfor already explained. The fact he starts with Rogue shouldn't prevent you from naming him Bruenor Battlehammer, and his name is Battlehammer, so he should carry a Battlehammer . But, if you want the waraxe, you'll have to drop a feat for it. What would you drop? Probably Improved Knockdown or Improved Critical. Actually, since this build doesn't go for Devastating Critical, there's no reason not to drop Improved Critical. In truth, the difference in weapon isn't going to be worth the feat investment. With a Warhammer, you'll be doing 1d8 damage and critting for 19-20 / x3. With the Dwarven Waraxe, you'll have 1d10 damage critting for 19-20 / x2. One thing that doesn't really matter in the OC but will in other worlds is that Slashing-type damage resistance is way more common than Bludgeoning-type. Not just because of damage belts, but Undead creatures alone have Slashing and Piercing resistance, while no Bludgeoning resistance.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, if you want to wield a waraxe go for it, but DON'T TAKE THAT FIGHTER LEVEL BEFORE. The reason why that 4th Fighter level is delayed is because you need to wait until the epics to be able to take Epic Weapon Specialization. Since there are only 4 Fighter levels in that build, you have to wait until a general feat level in epics to take that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe alternative is to change the whole spread of the build, lowering your DR and HP for one more feat and the ability to anticipate the Fighter feats. You can go Fighter 8 Rogue 10 DD 22. You would lose 8 HP, 3 /- Damage Reduction, but gain 1 feat (lose 1 feat from DD 26, gain 2 feats from Fighter 6 and Fighter 8). Then you would be able to take 6 Fighter / 4 Rogue 10 DD pre-epic, getting fewer skill dumps, but gaining 1 BAB and the extra feat you got could be used to get the Exotic Weapons you want so bad. Would you like me to build you that alternative?<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

In the OC, it should be more useful than anywhere else. The thing is that with your high Disable Traps total, you can recover traps, then set them against your enemies. Equip a bow, shoot an arrow and lure them to the green carpet of death!!!! Of course, you'd have to know the \"trick\" for setting multiple traps in one spot. If you want to, I can teach you.

Can't rememberthe name though. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd max's right, max out that persuade, you will make tons of checks based on it.

Imagine, just for the kicks, that the Drow Wizards (regular mobs, not special bosses like The Valsharess), have Time Stop, Greater Ruin, Mummy Dust, Epic Mage Armor, and they cast Mordenkainen's Disjunction to strip you clean of all your buffs and protections, and there are like 5 of them per screen.

Valerfor, his name was Mirumoto Hojatsu  and he ended up at lvl 35/36 (don't remember) when the party finished up.  Definitely not fully optimized but that's why it was a pure 40.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
