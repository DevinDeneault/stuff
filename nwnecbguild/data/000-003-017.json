      "content": "<div>This is my first post and first attempt at an all out character build.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am looking for some help on my support and possibly solo a module Bard Rogue build. I want buffs to not be able to be dispelled (hence 26 Bard levels). I want this character to be able to pick locks - find and disable traps - and set a few traps on the Rogue end of things. I went with Blackguard for the Charisma save bonus, extra sneak hit dice, and the free feat to use a scimitar.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried to build this toon with the ability to go into low level modules. ie. if the module automatically makes this toon level 12 instead of 40 - you can still be a decent support toon.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease help and or make suggestions as you see fit. \u00a0- I have used the Kamiryn's Character Build Calculator spreadsheet to build this toon, and I looked over and searched the ECB database and did not find this split for Bard/Rogue/Blackguard. \u00a0I have posted the output from the spreadsheet below. \u00a0Please note I put 1 point in many of the skills at level 1 of the build in order to be able to use the skills through out the life of the toon. The bard song increases the levels of your skills as it gets stronger so I figured it was a good call to have at least 1 point in many of the skills.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<table

      "content": "<div><blockquote><div><cite>wongdongfu wrote:</cite>\nThis is my first post and first attempt at an all out character build.</div></blockquote>\n\nHello Wongdongfu,<br/>\nThis is not bad at all for a first attempt build. You have got several things right, even though there is room for improvement. <span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83d\ude42</span><br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the formatting of your build, Empyre has already given some sound advice. I follow his guidlines too, when I post here.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>\nPlease note I put 1 point in many of the skills at level 1 of the build in order to be able to use the skills through out the life of the toon. The bard song increases the levels of your skills as it gets stronger so I figured it was a good call to have at least 1 point in many of the skills.\n</div></blockquote>\nYou are right about the fact that a high level bard song improves your skills. In your build it comes late. At lvl 20 you get a +2 bonus. At lvl 40 you get a +9 bonus from what equals a level 21 bard song. If you find ways to improve your perform skill to 80 (items, buffs), you get the full benefit of your level 26 song with +15 to skills.<br/>\nWhat you seem to have misunderstood is that some skills require training (1 or more base ranks), and others don't to come into play. The skills that require training are: animal empathy, disable trap, open lock, perform, pick pocket, set trap, spellcraft, tumble and umd. Of them only Animal empathy is not relevant here. You invest more than one rank in all of them except pick pocket.<br/>\nAll the other skills that you have put 1 rank into will also work without any ranks. IMO you waste a lot of skillpoints here, that can be put to better use in the skills you choose to focus on.\n<blockquote><div>\nI am looking for some help on my support and possibly solo a module Bard Rogue build. I want buffs to not be able to be dispelled (hence 26 Bard levels). I want this character to be able to pick locks - find and disable traps - and set a few traps on the Rogue end of things. I went with Blackguard for the Charisma save bonus, extra sneak hit dice, and the free feat to use a scimitar.\n</div></blockquote>\nI like that you take that much bard and focus on bard song with curse song, full perform ranks, an epic skill focus and an early LI feat. You have also put much emphasis on concentration, discipline, taunt, spellcraft, tumble and umd, skills that bard offers. You are definitely on the right track here!<br/>\n24 levels of bard gives indispellability. 26 levels gives another epic bonus feat.<br/>\nYou have chosen Blackguard as warrior class. You secure BAB +16 at lvl 20 for your 4th attack, and get AP Heavy and WP martial. You get a cha based bonus to saves and a 1d6 SA bonus. BG also offers a Bulls's strength that stacks with your bard spell Bull's. BG also let you take Divine might and -shield. When you take PA (to get Cleave, which you need to take BG in the first place), you already have the prerequisite.<br/>\nFighter would give you more feats and perhaps even EWS, but BG definitely has synergies with bard, and I like the combo.<br/>\nYou have taken rogue to be able to pick locks and handle traps. Rogue offers these skills, and let you handle high DC locks and traps. Rogue also adds a fair amount of skill-points and a considerable SA damage. Rogue also offers some very nice bonus feats.<br/>\nAs for the build proper:<br/>\nThere are four pre epic feats I would like to see here: Knockdown +\u00a0 Improved knockdown, Improved critical and Divine might. It is hard, if not impossible to fit them all in. <br/>\nKD (and even better IKD) gives two things; a way to dominate mages and a way to land your 6d6 SA damage. Mages don't cast anything when on their butts. Prone creatures suffer SA damage.<br/>\nImproved critical extends your critical threat range and leads to more critical hits.<br/>\nDivine might offers a divine damage bonus that can be very handy. If you max your charisma (to 28) with spells/gear you will have +9 divine damage for 9 rounds. You also want to cap your charisma to have better saves and to improve your modified perform rank.<br/>\nSome may also want feats like Divine shield and Expertise in here.<br/>\nIt is hard to find many feats to throw out. Toughness is my #1 candidate, and I believe the build can work well without Extend spell. It can even work without Still spell, but Still spell is great for casting short duration spells in combat. (The long duration spells can be cast normally well before battle if you remove your armor and shield.)<br/>\nMy final suggestion would probably be IKD, or KD and DM<br/>\nThere is not much to say about the epic feats, you have the essentials. Rogue 10 offers a bonus feat, and there are a lot of good options. If you take an epic skill focus feat, you can take Lasting inspiration as a bard bonus feat, and free up a general feat. If you take Great strength and then another Great strength rather than Armor skin, You get +1 AB. If you take 2 Great charisma instead you can end up with a divine might of +10 for 10 rounds.<br/>\nAs for the skills: <br/>\nYou have a good focus on most \"bard skills\". You will not need more than 40 ranks invested in Tumble. Bard will be able to cast spells from all scrolls with only 10 modified UMD ranks. But you may want to go higher if you want to equip magical items restricted to other classes, races or alignments. How high you want to take UMD depends on the magical level of the equipment in the module you play. There is still room for more ranks in spellcraft and concentration if you want.<br/>\nYou seem undecided when it comes to the lock and trap skills. <br/>\nDisarm trap is a skill that you can put 1 rank in if your only purpose is to recover traps you have set yourself. 5 ranks will give a +2 bonus to set trap. 16 modified ranks is enough to disarm all vanilla deadly traps you encounter in a module. 26 ranks let you recover them. (In multiplayer you must add the set trap skill of the character that set the trap, but that doesn't come into play here.) You need 38 modified ranks to disarm epic traps, and 48 to recover them.<br/>\n15 modified ranks in Set trap let you set all deadly traps except the gas ones. You need 45 modified ranks to set epic traps.<br/>\nYou seem to have missed out on the Search skill. 21 modified ranks let you detect all deadly traps immediately. 42 modified ranks let you detect epic traps immediately.<br/>\nMuch of your rogue skill progression comes very late and that makes me question the usefulness of the trap skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will suggest that you focus on how to implement the rogue part better into the build<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: <br/>\n\"Disclaimer\": I don't know to what extent EE changes game mechanics that I base this analysis on.</div>",
