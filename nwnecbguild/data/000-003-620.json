      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I've done a lot of experimenting with minmaxing damage for the server I currently play on, and unfortunately it's a lot more complex than just coming up with build ideas. The first time I made a full damage calc I tested more than 80 builds, and that was only for 5 different bosses. Even small changes such as switching weapons or swapping 2 STR for 2 CHA on Divine Might builds can make a significant difference to the damage you do.\u00a0Another factor is that certain types of builds (such as melee, ranged, DIvine Might users, etc) are better in certain situations, but you're probably already aware of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a list of the variables you would need to know if you want to completely minmax average damage per round against a specific opponent:<br/>\nTarget - AC, Damage Immunity, Damage Resistance, Damage Reduction, Critical Immunity, Sneak Attack Immunity, Concealment, Epic Dodge, and Deflect Arrows (for ranged builds).<br/>\nYour build - AB, Threat Range, Damage Types, Sneak Attack Die, Normal Damage Roll, Critical Damage Roll, Blind Fight.<br/>\nBy \"Normal Damage Roll\" and \"Critical Damage Roll\" I mean everything excluding Sneak Attack damage, so that includes base weapon damage, any bonus damage on your weapon, Massive Criticals either from the weapon or from Overwhelming Critical, and things like Bane Of Enemies or Divine Might. If your build dual-wields then you will need to include the information for the offhand weapon too.<br/>\nYou would need to know this information for every build you test and every target you face. This is excluding any custom features or weapon effects that your server might have, it can become even more complex once you include those.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince you're playing on a server that goes up to level 60 I'm assuming that there are probably other custom features, but in vanilla NWN the main classes to focus on for maximising damage are:<br/>\nBard, Cler, Figh, Monk, Pal, Rang, Rog, AA, Ass, BG, CoT, RDD, and WM.<br/>\nYou might need to get other classes for requirements or playability, but if you're focusing purely on damage then those are the classes you should focus on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Critical Immunity and Sneak Attack Immunity being common, I would recommend something along the lines of a STR/CHA Rang/Pal/Monk or STR/CHA Rang/Cler/Monk that dual wields kamas and uses Divine Might to bypass DI/DR. If +8 EB weapons are available then you can self-buff close to the AB cap, and Bane will give you extra AB and damage against FEs. This is just a rough idea though, since you've actually played on the server you probably know what works better than I do.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I haven't posted it anywhere since it's just a quick minmaxed build, I'll post a rough version here.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven as somebody who only plays optimised level 40 builds, fully minmaxed builds are not something I actually recommend playing. The basic Rang/Cler/Monk concept can (and should) be edited into a more balanced and playable build, but since this is purely about damage I haven't bothered. It's a melee DPS build made to be part of a balanced level 40 PvM party, if you want to do a lot of damage when solo then choose a more playable build.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe class spread is a choice between Rang26/Cler13/Monk1 and Rang26/Cler12/Monk2. Rang26/Cler12/Monk2 gets Deflect Arrows and is more playable but Rang26/Cler13/Monk1 has better Cleric spells so I went with that spread. Despite having 13 Cleric levels it can't cast level 7 Cleric spells due to the low WIS, changing this requires either dropping Dev Crit or lowering STR. For domains I went with Trickery and War, but Animal (for level 3 True Seeing) and Healing (for level 5 Heal) are decent alternatives too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis build ends with 30STR/16CHA, but 28STR/18CHA and 26STR/20CHA are both valid ending abilities. Since this is just a rough build I only tested the highest STR variant, whether higher STR or higher CHA is better depends on your opponent anyway. A 9 CHA modifier means your Divine Might matches up with your Extended Divine Favor when recasting, but\u00a0ultimately it doesn't really matter since perfect timing in the middle of combat is very difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll four of the tested builds had Dev Crit, you can free up some feats in this build by dropping it. A fully minmaxed version has 5 Favored Enemies and is only meant to be used against those 5 FEs. You can edit it to have up to 8 FEs, but at that point it's not fully minmaxed. I don't know which FEs are useful on your server so you will have to choose the 5 most important FEs.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy rearranging skill points you can get enough Set Trap for epic traps, but I didn't bother because it's made for hitting hard rather than strategy. Since this is just a rough build I haven't bothered with a full skill progression.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuffs: Aid (+1 AB for 26 turns), Bless (+1 AB for 13 turns), Extended Prayer (+1 AB, +1 Physical Damage for 26 rounds), Extended Battletide (+2 AB, +2 Magical Damage for 26 rounds), Extended Divine Favor (+4 AB, +4 Magical Damage for 2 turns), War Domain (+3 AB, +3 Physical Damage for 14 rounds), Divine Might (+9 Divine Damage for 9 rounds).<br/>\nTotal: +12 AB, +4 Physical Damage, +9 Divine Damage, +6 Magical Damage.<br/>\nBoth the Divine and Magical Damage bypass DI/DR, so that's a minimum of 15 damage against anything you hit.<br/>\nWhen using +8 EB kamas while War Domain is active you will be at the +20 AB cap, once it wears off you only have +17 AB. I didn't include War Domain when doing the damage calc because it has a short duration and can't be recast, so even without War Domain the build still out-damages alternative minmaxed builds.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, this is a build that is fully minmaxed for damage. If you want something more playable then you will either need to edit it or choose a different build.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nClass: Ranger 26 / Cleric 13 / Monk 1<br/>\nRace: Human<br/>\nAlignment: Any Lawful<br/>\nPlayability: 37-40 PvM<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 16 (30)<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 8<br/>\nWIS: 16<br/>\nINT: 8<br/>\nCHA: 16<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Ranger(1): Weapon Focus: Kama, Weapon Proficiency Exotic, Favored Enemy: Humans<br/>\n02: Ranger(2)<br/>\n03: Ranger(3): Blind Fight<br/>\n04: Ranger(4): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n05: Ranger(5): Favored Enemy: Elves<br/>\n06: Ranger(6): Power Attack<br/>\n07: Ranger(7)<br/>\n08: Ranger(8): STR+1, (STR=18)<br/>\n09: Ranger(9): Improved Critical: Kama<br/>\n10: Ranger(10): Favored Enemy: Halflings<br/>\n11: Ranger(11)<br/>\n12: Ranger(12): STR+1, Cleave, (STR=19)<br/>\n13: Ranger(13)<br/>\n14: Ranger(14)<br/>\n15: Ranger(15): Great Cleave, Favored Enemy: Dwarves<br/>\n16: Ranger(16): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n17: Ranger(17)<br/>\n18: Ranger(18): Extend Spell<br/>\n19: Ranger(19)<br/>\n20: Ranger(20): STR+1, Favored Enemy: Gnomes, (STR=21)<br/>\n21: Cleric(1): Divine Might, Domain Trickery, Domain War<br/>\n22: Ranger(21)<br/>\n23: Ranger(22)<br/>\n24: Ranger(23): STR+1, Great Strength I, Bane of Enemies, (STR=23)<br/>\n25: Ranger(24)<br/>\n26: Ranger(25): Epic Weapon Focus: Kama<br/>\n27: Cleric(2): Overwhelming Critical: Kama<br/>\n28: Cleric(3): STR+1, (STR=24)<br/>\n29: Cleric(4)<br/>\n30: Cleric(5): Great Strength II, (STR=25)<br/>\n31: Cleric(6)<br/>\n32: Cleric(7): STR+1, (STR=26)<br/>\n33: Cleric(8): Devastating Critical: Kama<br/>\n34: Cleric(9)<br/>\n35: Cleric(10)<br/>\n36: Cleric(11): STR+1, Great Strength III, (STR=28)<br/>\n37: Monk(1)<br/>\n38: Cleric(12)<br/>\n39: Cleric(13): Great Strength IV, (STR=29)<br/>\n40: Ranger(26): STR+1, Epic Prowess, (STR=30)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnimal Empathy 1(4), Concentration 43(42), Disable Trap 1(0), Discipline 43(53), Open Lock 1(0), Pick Pocket 1(0), Set Trap 1(0), Spellcraft 12(11), Tumble 40(39)<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nNaked Stats<br/>\nHitpoints: 332<br/>\nSkillpoints: 146<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 21/19/15<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +2<br/>\nBAB: 30<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 44 (melee), 30 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 20/28<br/>\nSpell Casting: Ranger(4),Cleric(6)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nBuffed Stats (Assuming +12 STR, +4 DEX, +12 CON, +12 CHA, +8 EB kamas, +5 AC items, and Haste)<br/>\nAB: 30 (BAB) + 16 (STR) + 4 (Feats) + 8 (EB Bonus) + 12 (Buffs) + 2 (Bane Of Enemies) - 2 (Dual-wielding) = +70 (+68 with Flurry)<br/>\nAC: 10 + 1 (DEX) + 3 (WIS) + 8 (Tumble) + 20 (AC Bonus) + 4 (Haste) = 46<br/>\nHP: 372 (Base) + 200 (CON) = 572<br/>\nFortitude: 22 (Base) + 5 (CON) = 27<br/>\nReflex: 16 (Base) + 1 (DEX) = 17<br/>\nWill: 16 (Base) + 3 (WIS) = 19<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
