      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hello All! I used to play NWN on an old PW server waaaaay back in the day, so you can imagine my excitement at the release of the EE. However, my old server is not currently up and I've decided to bide the time by playing on Arelith and with a concept I've never tried...A ranged character! *Le Gasp*. The idea I have is for either a Ranger/Monk/AA or Ranger/Cleric/AA. As the title states I want to make it a Zen Archer, and I am taking the Sniper path for the ranger with wood elf as my subrace. I want to have a build that can hold well in PvP but to be focused more towards PvM. My big questions are how does the Ranger/Cleric/AA compare to the Ranger/Monk/AA? What is your recommendations for level progression/starting stats/ feats/ skills? What's the max dps for each build? What does the AC look like for each build? How much does AC matter in Arelith? (I ask that last question because I've heard some crazy stories of monsters chewing through characters with an AC above 40 O.O ) The only thing I really know as far as the difference is that going the cleric route has more damage potential whereas going the monk route has more survivability (at least I think).<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you in advance from this new Arelith player! I look forward to playing with you :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That is exactly why I chose a Ranger. I get all of those awesome feats out the gate, and that frees up feats I can get later. The big reason I wanted Zen is because I wanted high wisdom so I can either multiclass into Monk (Which gives me speed, and Wis AC bonus ((It's also got tumble ;) )) So the high Wis contributes to the AC, and if I keep it higher than Dex I can have a solid AB)), or the other hand, I was considering Cleric for the healing and buffs (High Wis equals extra spell slots as well), which could significantly increase my damage, but I would be sacrificing good AC and speed. However, with Cleric comes the possibility of Improved Invisibility, in which case I may not need HIPS. I was thinking at least 6 lvls Ranger so I can get my animal companion as well as some spell casting (High Wis will give me bonus slots) then go Monk at 7th level and continue monk til either 9th or 10th level (If to 9th switch back to Ranger at 10th) Then take AA at 11th level when I have the AB to reach it. Of course I'd carry on as AA till atleast lvl 20 or 21 (+5 vs. +6 arrows), but after that point I'm kinda stumped haha. And with Cleric I have no idea really how I would split levels. I just know that I would want great damage buffs and either extend or max spell at some point lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: And as far as the SD, though that sounds pretty good, you need a tumble of 5 to even become a SD....which means that I would need to take a tumble class other than SD first. So unfortunately I don't think SD is a viable option for an AA build with Ranger<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I take the gift of Grace (+2 to Dex for 18) and either take Gift of Insight (+2 WIs\u00a0for 16) or Gift of Endurance (+2 to Con to give me 14). Take the wood elf subrace and path of the sniper for archery feats. Go Ranger lvl\u00a06, and at 7th level go Monk until lvl\u00a09 (which is 3 lvls\u00a0monk) then go back to Ranger at lvl\u00a010, or just stick with monk til lvl\u00a010 (which makes 4 lvls\u00a0monk) and take my first AA lvl\u00a0at 11th lvl.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, another thing I've been considering...what if my total\u00a0lvl\u00a0split looks like 8 Ranger/ 5 Monk/ 17 AA? By then I'll be able to cast second lvl\u00a0Ranger spells (due to bonus spell slots from Wis) which gives me access to Cat's Grace as well as One With The Land, and Protection from Elements. I'll have Purity of Body from Monk class, which gives me immunity to non-magical disease and a huge boon to saves overall. And at 17th lvl\u00a0AA I get +9 arrows. Does that sound\u00a0formidable? I could switch out one lvl\u00a0of monk for another AA lvl\u00a0to make the split look like Ranger 8/ Monk 4/ AA 18 which would give me 2 bonus feats from epic AA lvls\u00a0and increase my imbue arrow from 13d6 to 14d6. Though I would lose the disease immunity, I still keep the +4 to all saves with monk. Thoughts?\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Although if I waited til lvl\u00a013 to take AA, I would have access to my 2nd lvl\u00a0Ranger spells earlier and knock out my split for ranger and monk lvls then just lock into AA for the rest of my progression...?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

These warriors are renowned for their skills with a bow, and their swift retribution. Their name strikes fear into the hearts of nature\u2019s enemies, their eyes ever shifting through the foliage searching for these silent stalkers. Wardens, however, know that their arrows are meant to be felt\u2026not seen. Their ability to engage an enemy from a distance, and disengage with blinding speed dazes and confuses their prey. They even use their bows in melee combat, dodging and weaving past enemy attacks and loosing an arrow when their opponent\u2019s guard is open. Their only moral obligation is to their order, their people, their own personal code, and to the balance of nature. \u00a0Should you threaten any of the things they stand for\u2026you\u2019d best watch your back\u2026.else one of their arrows may find you, whistling through the dark.

But both should be decent. I'm also not sure as to how many skill points it'll have in total as I noticed something weird with Arelith. When I hit 3rd level in Arelith I suddenly get an additional 2 skill points even though my Int is only 12. I.e. I started out at lvl 2 with 5 skill points to spend, then when I hit lvl 3 I got 7 skill points to spend. I'm not sure if this is some kind of bug, or if that is just how Arelith works. If that's truely the case. I would \u00a0just put my points into Discipline, Hide, Move Silently, Listen, and Spot when taking ranger lvls and save 2 points each level after 2nd. Then when I hit Monk at 7th lvl, dump into Tumble and discipline until I hit Ranger at 10th lvl, then continue with Discipline, Hide, Move Silently, Listen, Spot until I hit AA at 12th lvl. Once I go AA I pour into Hide, Move Silenty, Listen, and Spot and then....save points til 27th? Once I take Monk at 27th dump back into Discipline and Tumble, then at 28th AA continue with Hide, Move Silently, Listen, Spot...I may have a few points left over and the only things I would consider for that is Lore or Heal I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts thus far?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Listen and Spot do almost the same thing, so it is a little bit redundant to put points in both. However, Listen lets you \"see\" around corners, but not hiding enemies that are standing still, which Spot helps you with, so spending points in both is not completely useless, if you can't find anywhere better to put the skill points.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
