It's an anti-class-dump server I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\n It will be a horrible XP penalty but with these classes and the leveling prereqs there isn't much way around that.

At least that was the way I understood it, only by interpreting the requestor's instructions, one that seemed to evolve further as suggestions were made.  Naturally, if it is possible to dump to a multiclass as in \"normal\" building, that is what I would have recommended to avoid inefficient \"clumping\"... a rather benign adjustment to the posted build IMO.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is really needed is an entry in the PW section that briefly describes the rules that impact character building on each server (Arelith, WoG, Amia, etc.) listing custom requirements and accommodations so that guild members who play them can keep it up-to-date and guild builders will have an accurate template.  I don't really care for RP servers myself so it is unlikely I will ever gain any real-time experience with Arelith (or any other custom RP server, for that matter) when it comes to building characters for them.  Even with a general guideline provided, the best way to make build decisions is by actually playing on a server. It makes a HUGE difference!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

They're the most competent self-buffers that exist. Now I hear that Arelith has this rule where two spells on the same weapon don't stack, so I would carry around 2 weapons for each hand (1 to buff with Darkfire and another with GMW). The rest of the buffs, like DIvine Power, which sets ur str to 18, and Divine Favor, should work as intended. No Cleric / Monk with at least 8 attacks per round or at most 10 attacks per round is EVER going to do little damage, unless you have epic mobs with 30/- DR, plus 10/- Fire and 10/- Magic damage resistance. There are just too many sources of damage.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
