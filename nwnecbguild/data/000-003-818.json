Nice to see this guild again..<br/>\nAt this time I would ask for help to find or maybe create a build of berserker type. I mean not only classic barbarian rage but something really extreme. 1-40 build with greatsword I guess..<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 I have no thoughts about his classes for sure. The main concept is Attack &gt; Defend, really hard slashing and sacrificing HP. Nwn have no one spell or feat that impact based on your HP lvl or percentage of it. It's very sad to know meh<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I've been having a quick look at that Chosen of Tempos V2 build by Mith, and just wondered whether a more offensive-minded version might be to use Half-Orc rather than Human and keep CON to 21 rather than 22 (as you only need 21 for EDR III). That would mean you could start off with STR 19 and end with 28 for an extra AB and Dev Crit point.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, you'd be left with 1 spare start stat point, which is probably going to be most useful in DEX, and lose Toughness and another 40 HPs from the drop in CON, but you'd still have nearly 650, as well as 14/- DR, so still more than acceptable. The bigger concern might be skill points, but Heal ain't worth much anyway, so that leaves 24 more to lose, which would probably have to come from the cross-classed Spellcraft.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've also looked at jiggling the feats about a bit and including GDL's suggestion...oh, sod it, I think I've just talked myself into trying to come up with a full adaptation - but only as a potential variant of Mith's build, obviously, because the principle is a sound one.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon't worry, I'll do it in a separate thread, Ketsu!<br/>\n<br/>\nGood to be back!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
