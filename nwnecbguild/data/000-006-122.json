The idea is actually kind of funny. The good guy arrives in Heaven and someone asks him: \"How did you die?\". The guy responds: \"Well, I was walking around the road when a HUGE DRAGON came out of nowhere and caught me off-guard!\". How can you not see a dragon approaching, right? Well, here is how:<br/>\n<br/>\n Surprise!<br/>\n<br/>\n Druid(24), Assassin(14), Shadowdancer(2), Human<br/>\n<br/>\n Alignment: Neutral Evil<br/>\n<br/>\n Playability: 1-40 PvM<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 8<br/>\n DEX: 15 (16)<br/>\n CON: 8<br/>\n WIS: 18 (34)<br/>\n INT: 14<br/>\n CHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n Human: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n 01: Druid(1): Knockdown, Extend Spell<br/>\n 02: Druid(2)<br/>\n 03: Druid(3): Blind Fight<br/>\n 04: Druid(4): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br/>\n 05: Druid(5)<br/>\n 06: Druid(6): Zen Archery<br/>\n 07: Druid(7)<br/>\n 08: Druid(8): WIS+1, (WIS=20)<br/>\n 09: Druid(9): Empower Spell<br/>\n 10: Druid(10)<br/>\n 11: Druid(11)<br/>\n 12: Druid(12): WIS+1, Improved Critical: Unarmed, (WIS=21)<br/>\n 13: Druid(13)<br/>\n 14: Druid(14)<br/>\n 15: Druid(15): Dodge<br/>\n 16: Druid(16): WIS+1, (WIS=22)<br/>\n 17: Assassin(1)<br/>\n 18: Assassin(2): Mobility, {Uncanny Dodge I}<br/>\n 19: Assassin(3)<br/>\n 20: Assassin(4): WIS+1, (WIS=23)<br/>\n 21: Druid(17): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=24)<br/>\n 22: Shadowdancer(1): {Hide in Plain Sight}<br/>\n 23: Shadowdancer(2): {Darkvision, Evasion}<br/>\n 24: Assassin(5): WIS+1, Great Wisdom II, (WIS=26)<br/>\n 25: Assassin(6)<br/>\n 26: Assassin(7)<br/>\n 27: Assassin(8): Great Wisdom III, (WIS=27)<br/>\n 28: Assassin(9): WIS+1, (WIS=28)<br/>\n 29: Assassin(10)<br/>\n 30: Assassin(11): Great Wisdom IV, (WIS=29)<br/>\n 31: Assassin(12)<br/>\n 32: Assassin(13): WIS+1, (WIS=30)<br/>\n 33: Druid(18): Dragon Shape<br/>\n 34: Druid(19)<br/>\n 35: Druid(20) 36: Druid(21): WIS+1, Epic Prowess, (WIS=31)<br/>\n 37: Druid(22) 38: Druid(23)<br/>\n 39: Druid(24): Great Wisdom V, Great Wisdom VI, (WIS=33)<br/>\n 40: Assassin(14): WIS+1, Great Dexterity I, (DEX=16), (WIS=34)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 252<br/>\n Skillpoints: 305<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 20/33/22<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses: Traps: +2, Poison: +6, Fear: +2<br/>\n BAB: 25<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 25 (melee), 38 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 21/28<br/>\n Spell Casting: Druid(9)<br/>\n Alignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\n Animal Empathy 21(20), Concentration 42(41), Heal 21(33), Hide 43(46), Move Silently 43(46), Spot 43(55), Tumble 40(43), UMD 36(35)<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Animal Empathy(4), Concentration(4), Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Save(12),<br/>\n 02: Animal Empathy(1), Concentration(1), Save(17),<br/>\n 03: Animal Empathy(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(19),<br/>\n 04: Animal Empathy(1), Save(25),<br/>\n 05: Animal Empathy(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(27),<br/>\n 06: Animal Empathy(1), Save(33),<br/>\n 07: Animal Empathy(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(35),<br/>\n 08: Animal Empathy(1), Save(41),<br/>\n 09: Animal Empathy(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(43),<br/>\n 10: Animal Empathy(1), Save(49),<br/>\n 11: Animal Empathy(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(51),<br/>\n 12: Animal Empathy(1), Save(57),<br/>\n 13: Animal Empathy(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(59),<br/>\n 14: Animal Empathy(1), Save(65),<br/>\n 15: Animal Empathy(1), Save(71),<br/>\n 16: Animal Empathy(1), Save(77),<br/>\n 17: Hide(12), Move Silently(12), Spot(20), Tumble(20), UMD(20),<br/>\n 18: Heal(2), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),<br/>\n 19: Heal(2), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),<br/>\n 20: Heal(2), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),<br/>\n 21: Animal Empathy(2), Heal(1), Save(4),<br/>\n 22: Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Spot(2), Tumble(2), Save(5),<br/>\n 23: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), Save(10),<br/>\n 24: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(4), Save(9),<br/>\n 25: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(11),<br/>\n 26: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(13),<br/>\n 27: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(15),<br/>\n 28: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(17),<br/>\n 29: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(19),<br/>\n 30: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(21),<br/>\n 31: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(23),<br/>\n 32: Save(30),<br/>\n 33: Concentration(31), Heal(6),<br/>\n 34: Concentration(1), Heal(6),<br/>\n 35: Concentration(1), Heal(2), Save(4),<br/>\n 36: Concentration(1), Save(10),<br/>\n 37: Concentration(1), Save(16),<br/>\n 38: Concentration(1), Save(22),<br/>\n 39: Concentration(1), Save(28),<br/>\n 40: Hide(9), Move Silently(9), Spot(9), Tumble(6), UMD(2),<br/>\n<br/>\n Well, I thought I'd\u00a0steer out of the whole Druid / Monk thing and try something that literally has NEVER been done before. This is by no means a Powerbuild, but it's fun to play, even though kind of hard to RP. It will only have 3 Attacks per Round, but with the Dragon's huge STR and the 7d6 Sneak Attack, a small chance of paralyzing opponents (that will get doubled with a Haste Helm or Armor), and pretty good AB (57 with all buffs on and Capped STR). HiPS will make you nearly immortal, allow you to rebuff, heal and reposition even before you get your Dragon Shape. You can scout all your enemies, strategize and flee if things get nasty. Of course, you don't have HiPS till level 22, but you have all Druid buffs, summoning spells, elemental shape, etc.. to get through them.<br/>\n<br/>\n No similar builds in the Search Engine. So, how do you like the idea?<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<br/>\n<br/>\n EDIT I: Valerfor suggested an interesting tweak to the build below. You can change the spread to 20 /\u00a018 / 2 and take ESF: Hide and ESF: Move Silently with Assassin Bonus Feats, making him even harder to detect. However, that would make you dispellable, and you'd end up on lower Wisdom, which means lower DCs for your spells, a few less spells per day and lower durations with the -4\u00a0Caster Levels. The gain is +1 AC from Armor Skin (you lose 1 AC from the Great Dexterity feat and end up in an odd score, might as well drop it for CON and more HP in Human form). Anyway, it's a viable tweak that is absolutely in line with the theme and would make him better at that which he's already really good, but IMO the sacrifice is too great. I doubt anyone can have a Spot score so high that will detect you with Camouflage, Mass Camouflage and a Draconic DEX modifier. That's why I chose to keep him as is.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I thought it was one of those cases with different spelling for American x British english (Color x Colour, Armor x Armour, Honor x Honour, etc..) where both were acceptable, but I was wrong. Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n I brought back the original name and added the second one just because I can't save anything with astherisks on my computer, so I had to change it up.<br/>\n<br/>\n For the concept, I like your suggestion, but I would rather list it as a viable tweak than actually add it to the build. The reason for this is that the character would gain the ESFs, but have a significantly higher chance of losing the Camouflage and Mass Camouflage buffs, which together account for 2 ESFs for each skill. Plus, dispellability for Druids is a really big problem, because they need to de-shift to rebuff, and this toon doesn't have infinite Elemental Shape, attained at Druid 26, and only 3 Dragon Shapes a day, which means he'd need to use the Dire Bear form for the mob-fights most of the time to make sure he has enough resources to last him. The Dire Bear form without Monk Wisdom AC is just AWFUL in defense. Shifting twice on the same battle is terrible for him. Still, at least until the first strike, your suggestion would be great and make him much harder to detect. But it'd also cause him to end up on an odd Wisdom score, but that's fixable dropping one GW for Armor Skin.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'll edit the OP to include your suggestion.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks!</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Spell DCs are sufficiently high, though, enough to make them reliable for mob control, with 46 self-buffable Wisdom from Owl's Insight, which is indispellable. SoV will have a DC of 10 +9 + 18 = 37, which is not bad for melee low-dex types. Stonehold will have a DC of 34, which is enough for typical mobs that have around 15 Will at 40.<br/>\n<br/>\n AC= 61 (62-63 with Cat's Grace potion) Hasted with a +5 armor, 50% Concealment from Assassin Improved Invisibility. Further increasable if you have access to DEX-boosting Armor or Shield before shifting and an Ioun Stone that boosts DEX. But you have HiPS for most battles so this low number is not really that important, except against true-seers.<br/>\n<br/>\n Saves: 38 / 38 / 42 (Fort/Ref/Will)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hide score: 82 (fully buffed)<br/>\n<br/>\n Move Silently score: 62\u00a0(fully buffed)<br/>\n<br/>\n With wands, these numbers could be better, but I didn't have the patience to make them or buy them in the trainer module.<br/>\n<br/>\n You can cast Darkness, Invisibility,\u00a0Ghostly Visage and Improved Invisibility\u00a0from DS too, as\u00a0they're Assassin feats, not spells.

These would be the ideal places to stop leveling on Druid because that's where you get the most benefits.<br/>\n<br/>\nAssassin, being a Prestige Class, grants a bonus feat every 4 levels after 10, so 14, 18, 22, 26 and 30 (can't have more than 30 Assassin levels in a build due to it being a Prestige Class)<br/>\n<br/>\nShadowdancer is also a Prestige Class, which grants HiPS with just 1 level, and Evasion at level 2. Darkvision is kind of nice, but the Dragon has True Seeing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, as you can see, in terms of optimization, this is as good as it gets. Val's split is also optimized, but he trades off the Druid feat and indispellability for a higher Death Attack DC and an Assassin Bonus feat. What is better is a matter of personal preference, whether you prefer to paralyze your opponents more often or have indispellable buffs, it's entirely up to you. I personally think that being dispelled hurts A LOT for Druids, because they can't rebuff while shifted, and de-shifting to rebuff is often more dangerous than it's worth. But as I said, it's my personal preference.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nYour suggested spread, however is not optimal. It doesn't end on a level that gives you anything in either Assassin or Druid, and for that reason, I'd suggest against it. This reminds me of when I started in the ECB, and I'd look at builds without really understanding why certain choices had been made by the builders, then I changed them, played them, they didn't reach their full potential, and then I went back to what the builder had originally come up with now knowing why he had chosen to do what he had done. That happened when I played Myth's Hierophant of Velsharoon and I JUST wanted to end on 20 Wisdom, but after playing it, I realized I wasn't really losing that much by ending at 19 Wisdom, and it allowed me to manage my inventory better, because I could just get +11 Wisdom enhancement to cap the modifier, so a +6 periapt and a +5 ring were enough to cap it. Anyway, I think what you can take from this is that sometimes you need to try to \"get in the head\" of the builder and imagine why he chose to do things the way he did.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be honest, I'd pick what you think is more valuable (indispellability or a higher DA DC), and just play the associated build.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

So, at least for me, this build still works as intended. Too bad about the nerf to Assassins. They should increase the DC, then, make it compatible with DevCrit DCs to even out this nerf. IMO Assassins weren't particularly OP as they were....<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thanks for the info. I guess it's worth noting then that this build is no longer good (not that it ever was LOL). This was a meme build based on how absurd it would be for anyone not to see or hear a Gargantuan Dragon approaching. It still cracks me up that things like these are possible in D&amp;D LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
