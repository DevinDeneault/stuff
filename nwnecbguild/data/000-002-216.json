For example, I'm currently testing a build who's presently wearing armour that soaks 5 bludgeoning damage, and has a shield that gives 5/+2 DR. I appreciate that the one soaks the first 5 points of all bludgeoning damage, while the other resists the first 5 points of damage from up to +2 weapons, but does the one cancel out the other, or do they stack? And what's applied first - Resistance or Soak? I looked on the wiki, and felt no better I'm afraid.<br/>\n<br/>\n It's one of those things that's bugged me over time, but I've only just got round to asking for knowledge - soz!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It also helped with my misapprehension that (eg) DR 20/+3 included +3 weapons, whereas it's actually up to but not including +3.<br/>\n<br/>\n Feeling much better now, thanks for digging up the link.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
