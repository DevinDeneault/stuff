      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi Web<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your thoughtful comments, particularly Web with your detailed thoughts.\u00a0This is the first time I have attempted a build with improved spell resistance this high.<br/>\n<br/>\nZanithar has it correct, I am trying to preserve the BAB as much as possible so this guy has some threatening combat ability with non-mages too.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe assassin levels are taken epic to preserve the AB and add UMD to the build. The Assassin level is taken at 31 to obtain UMD 33 modified ASAP, which allows unrestricted spell casting from scrolls without failure in modules where this is enabled. I understand in WoG currently there is no spell failure from UMD so a lower UMD amount is more than adequate and that level can be taken earlier for faster uncanny dodge, but I've designed this in case it wants to be ported to other modules.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think any 8-10 attack per round build with some decent AB, crazy speed and a touch of UMD is going to threaten enemies. I also believe I have to go dex rather than strength with this build, otherwise the AC will be bad, but I'm happy to be corrected.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand Monk is the only class which can obtain the improved spell resistance feat either as an epic feat or bonus feat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have reset my goals for Base AB 38+, BAB 26+, ITWF Kama, WS/EWS, stealth/UMD/Tumble/Discipline/Listen and enough spell resistance (rather than the immunity achieved from SR 67+).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI had an excess of feats pre-epic to use, so I chose the Resist Energy feats. They stack with damage reduction from items.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSo a Resist Energy: Acid feat (5/-), combined with an amulet of acid resistance (20/-) will mean 25/- acid damage reduction. Or with a ring of elemental resistance (15/-) it means 20/- acid damage reduction. It reduces the amount those acid shields might do to you which is a way I have died playing those 10 APR builds as a monk, although a decent caster will do a decent amount of damage to you. Ideally you want to breach or Mord such defenses, but perhaps there might be a situation where I cannot do so. If I wanted to go hardcore I could take multiple Epic Energy Resistance: Acid feats instead but I wanted spell resistance instead. Such feats also work against spells such as darkfire and flame weapon (hence the Resist Energy: Fire feat), or added elemental damage from weapons.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll edit the main post to improve SR to 56. That way the level 40 caster with epic spell penetration has to roll a 10 or more (45% chance of spell resistance). A level 40 caster without any spell penetration feats will need to roll a 16 or more (75% chance of spell resistance). A spell sword or UMD user cannot use any offensive targeting spells against this guy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe a level 40 caster with epic spell penetration deserves to get some spells off by the way, with the amount of investment in those feats and caster levels. It does make the modules created interesting to play against.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nOne further comment is that if I can get the SR close to 50/50 for bosses, then he can use UMD + greater spell mantles (on a sequencer if possible) + a potion of speed or even better a mass haste scroll and charge in at the speed of light at +100 monk speed, potentially stealthed/invisible, with TT or Divine Power active .\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nEven if its 50/50 for the caster to get that Bigby's to penetrate, he then has to content with the spell mantle whilst he gets his mord scroll/spell breach scroll off then starts mowing into the mage with 10 APR / round. A spell like Epic Warding or Time Stop is going to be a problem which hopefully you can just run into the shadows with your crazy speed, go into stealth mode and wait it out a bit, then sneak up on those mage bastards again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not an attractive opponent for a mage to face, although a good one certainly has a fighting chance to win.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure what happens to the removal of the speed cap with monk speed if you use stealth mode, it would be interesting to know how that plays if you have mass haste or expeditious retreat active and how fast a +100 monk speed character would be moving. If anyone knows feel free to post up your experience with this.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway keen to know what your thoughts are again with this modification, appreciate your suggestions as always<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

So the only controllable factor is the BAB of the classes involved up to level 20.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nBAB is added to characters up to level 20 in the following way:<br/>\n<br/>\nFull BAB or combat classes (fighter, barbarian, paladin, ranger, blackguard, champion of torm, dwarven defender, weapon master, arcane archer, purple dragon knight) obtain 1 BAB / level pre-epic<br/>\n<br/>\n3/4 BAB classes or middle classes (rogue, monk, bard, cleric, druid, assassin, shadow dancer etc) obtain 1 BAB / level except the first level every four levels. This means BAB is not gained at level 1, 5, 9, 13 and 17, pre-epic, but gained at other levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nIe. the first level of a middle class taken pre-epic means 1 BAB is not gained, the next three levels of that middle class gains 1 BAB / level, then the next 1 level does not gain 1 BAB etc etc.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThese rules only apply to individual classes. So a Rogue 2 / Monk 1 / Cleric 1 would have a BAB of 1 (not gaining 3 BAB with Rogue 1 Cleric 1 and Monk 1), whereas a Rogue 4 would have a BAB of 3 (not gaining 1BAB with Rogue 1). All things equal, this is a 10% chance to hit and crit between those two builds.<br/>\n<br/>\n1/2 BAB classes or non-combat classes (wizard, sorcerer, palemaster) gains 1 BAB every second level. So a Wizard 2 and a Wizard 3 both have a BAB of 1, as Wizard 1 and Wizard 3 do not gain BAB.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe pre-epic split, of the first 20 levels is the most important factor in determining BAB.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, maximising the amount of Full BAB classes pre-epic maximises the ultimate BAB and AB. However sometimes this is not always ideal.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, a player may want to make a Fighter / Bard / Red Dragon Disciple, but not want to take more than 6 levels of fighter and not more than 10 levels of Red Dragon Disciple (RDD). In addition, that player may want to access bonus feats granted by the fighter class which are only available in Epic levels, such as Epic Weapon Specialisation.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore to maximise BAB with a Fighter 6 / Bard 24 / RDD 10 build, the best BAB achievable is 26, which is achieved by:<br/>\n<br/>\n- taking Fighter 4 / Bard 12 / RDD 4 or Fighter 5 / Bard 11 / RDD 4 or Fighter 5 / Bard 12 / RDD 3 pre-epic (up to level 20) to obtain a pre-epic BAB of 16<br/>\n- other classes at other levels for +10 AB over 20 levels regardless of classes chosen, to get to 26.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaking a build where the pre-epic class split is Fighter 4 / Bard 6 / RDD 10 is tempting to access the enormous +8 strength bonuses of the class but the eventual pre-epic BAB will be 15 (not gaining BAB with Bard 1, 5 and RDD 1, 5 and 9), therefore losing AB long-term, and also the character doing one less attack per round permanently.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I take another example, say a Fighter 24 / Bard 6 / RDD 10 build, to maximise BAB, one will want to take Fighter 20 pre-epic to obtain a pre-epic BAB of 20 and eventual level 40 BAB of 30.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever for game play reasons that player may want a few Bard levels pre-epic for say, skill dumps into Tumble, Perform and Spellcraft and to use Bard Song for a party. In this case a Fighter 17 / Bard 3 split with total levels of 20 would obtain a pre-epic BAB of 19 and eventual level 40 BAB of 29 which is not far off a BAB of 30. Such sacrifices are legitimate, they preserve the character of the build in the first 20 levels, and lets face it, the first 20 levels is more than half the module in many cases (for example HoTU goes to level 28, and Aielund goes to 36-38).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would lead to the lowest AB however, is to try to take a Fighter 5 / Bard 5 / RDD 10 split pre-epic which would lead to a pre-epic BAB of 25 (by not gaining BAB with Bard 1, Bard 5, RDD 1, RDD 5 and RDD 9), and also losing one attack per round permanently.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs one can see changing the pre-epic split of a class can greatly alter the ultimate power of a build by up to 5 BAB in these examples which is essentially a 25% reduction in the chance to hit and crit as well as losing one attack per round. So understanding the mechanics how the pre-epic split works is important in maximising BAB and eventual AB for a level 20+ build.</div></blockquote>\nThe <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Base_attack_bonus\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NWN Wiki: Base Attack Bonus</a> might be helpful too for more details<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that explains things adequately<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi Web<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat to hear Maskalene is a total monster and a challenge I will face later on the server, perhaps in a party to begin with :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy playtesting is quite enjoyable. Early monk is really bad, it's only when one gets a bit more BAB for the extra attacks then some added damage from WS that the build starts to become quite powerful, I think that occurred for me when I got to Monk 2 / Fighter 4. Four attacks per round at level 6 is no joke, heh :)\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore then I think I just made use of the fighter level and equipped some armor and shields and a longsword or something.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now he's level 16 (Monk 12/Fighter 4). I'm glad I made him dex based. Right now I'm not actually missing the extra damage I would have got from strength, probably because of Weapon Specialization, and some +3 kamas. The AC from dex is quite handy as well.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nStealth and monk speed is super fun at the level I'm at. I stealth into a mob, assassinate a mage quickly in the backlines in a few flurries with improved knockdown (3 attacks, 3 attacks, 2 attacks) at the moment) then charge out with +40 monk speed with a huge mob of angry meleers hot on my tail, pop around a corner, stealth, and these guys are scratching their heads wondering what happened. Any further mages left behind, the mob is spread out, and confused, searching for me, are more vulnerable. Can rinse and repeat.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I was super smart I would also lay a whole bunch of electrical traps for the angry mob to run into when I escape to speed up the process.<br/>\n<br/>\nLater on when those mages are given true sight the stealth may not be quite as effective but I believe the +100 monk speed will always be effective :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for helping me with this build Web, its much appreciated. Picked up a holy gem on WoG last night adventuring with a friend by the way. Happy days.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
