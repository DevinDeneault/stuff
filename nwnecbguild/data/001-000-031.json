This, it seems, can lead to problems in some modules - such as discussions not being triggered and high level foes with already decent AI now being untouchable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll try and give you the link here, but I ain't been too successful at this in the past, so no promises...<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/other/patch/community-patch-project\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://neverwintervault.org/project/nw ... ch-project</a><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
