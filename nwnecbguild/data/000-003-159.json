      "content": "<div>Okay.\u00a0 Better.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Then if low magic, haste is invaluable since low magic almost never has any permahaste or crit immune items.\u00a0 Same for UMD.\u00a0 Makes a huge difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n Therefore, you'd either want to multi to a class that can extend haste (bard/wiz/sorc) or else rely on haste scrolls (if available) or speed pots.<br/>\n<br/>\n Low magic typically doesn't abound in dispellers so your caster level should be able to be quite low (&lt;20) and still be effective.\u00a0 You could use cleric to self-buff and bard for skill dumps and extended haste, probably in robes unless you use still spells but which will prevent extended versions.\u00a0 Which brings up another common issue in low magic... can you save skills or must you use all of them each level?\u00a0 It matters.<br/>\n<br/>\n The key will be balancing 3 abilities (WIS/CHA and either STR or DEX) but fortunately, cleric can compensate for a pedestrian primary attack ability very well and you wouldn't need more than CHA 14 to get the most from bard casting.\u00a0 Temporarily thinking something like Bard 10-14, Cleric 16, CoT 10.\u00a0 Probably not high enough INT for a broad skill set, though.\u00a0 Maybe Taunt or maybe not.<br/>\n<br/>\n Assuming there are no alignment restrictions (non-evil, non-lawful) with the deity (there often are, actually), bard/CoT should work fine.\u00a0 Perhaps a human clc/brd/CoT?\u00a0 It could self-buff weapon/armor very high (especially going as a robed DEXer) and still have adequate casting potential.\u00a0 There probably are already some builds around with that combo that could be modified for the 3-level qualifying sequence on your server.\u00a0 Check the <strong><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2354480/How-and-Where-to-Access-Legacy-ECB-Archives\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#FF0000\">legacy archive</span></a></strong> until I or another guild member can check back in.<br/>\n<br/>\n Trying to think out of the box here. Impressions?<br/>\n<br/>\n edit: Found just one build that fits my suggestion, but it pumps CHA instead of an attack ability which I am not a fan of.\u00a0 Anyway, check it out to see the feats and general framework for potential.<em> </em>The build:<em> Diva of the Goddess</em> bard 15/cleric 15/champion of Torm 10 (human) by theshadow0015.\u00a0 Max built a bard dump <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2269037/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Linu</a> version which probably won't work in this case due to Travel being prohibited but still worth checking how he managed his selections.</div>"
