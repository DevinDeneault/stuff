      "content": "<div>Hello! I'd like to start over the campaigns with a character that i never used before: a weaponmaster. However, i think that some social skills are mandatory for the character to not being a tool during the campaign, so i was thinking about making fighter/bard/weaponmaster. The same goes for the stats: i'd like to use social skill and not being a complete idiot, so i think cha and wis shouldn't be too low...My other questions are: how many levels of bard should i pick for it to being useful? Is\u00a0 bard better than rogue? Are melee classes fun to go through the campaigns with, or will i miss out lots of dialogues?<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hello and welcome, Vhalyr!<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore we get going, which campaigns are you wanting to play? Are you talking about the Original (Plague) Campaign followed by something else, or Shadows of Undrentide followed by Hordes of the Underdark then something else, or any of the numerous modules or persistent worlds?<br/>\n<br/>\nYour timing is perfect, btw. Empyre 65 recently provided me with a couple of WM builds because I'd always struggled with them before. One has Devastating Critical, the other not (again, it depends where you want to play). The first can be found in the General Discussion sub-forum on page 20 (iirc) of the New Full Epic Series thread (post #200, dated 6 April this year) and is a Fighter 14/ Bard 10/ WM 16. The second is in the Modules sub-forum on page 28 of the Aielund Saga thread (post #280, dated 26 August this year) and is a Fighter 10/ Bard 8/ WM 22.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelee classes are excellent fun (much better than those spellcasting loons imo - others may take issue, but they're just wrong), and you shouldn't be missing out on stuff wherever you play.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, have a look at those two, and let us know where you'll be playing.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!</div>",

      "content": "<div>As far as the official campaigns are concerned, the OC will get you to around level 17/8 and SoU/HotU will end at about level 28. If you want continuity, you really shouldn't do the OC/SoU/HotU, because the middle one will be incredibly dull as you'll be so overpowered for it - it's designed for level 1 to about level 15. So if you want to get all the way to 40 you'll have to go into some other modules. Here are a few options I've enjoyed...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe OC followed by Aribeth's Redemption then Sands of Fate.<br/>\nThe OC followed by Mines of Twin Summit.<br/>\nSoU followed by HotU (there's a bridge module called the Nether Scrolls, which I haven't played but Empyre recommends) then Sands of Fate.<br/>\nThen there's the awesome Aielund Saga, which takes you from level 1 up to around level 36/7.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I'll leave it with you.<br/>\nCheers</div>",

I read somewhere that rangers have custom dialogue lines?\n</div></blockquote>\n\nHoorah!<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the great things about Aielund is that (assuming you have a decent build) any class can excel. Though, to be fair, I couldn't attest to those odd spell-chucking types. Empyre gives 3 splendid - and splendidly different options - but many others will work just fine (I know Mick's soloed it as an Assassin, while I do like me some DwD and/or CoT. And Dex builds are as worthwhile as Str ones). It helps hugely that the AI of NPCs is so much better, and you get to travel with two at a time - do have chats with them as you go along.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not that Rangers have custom dialogue lines as such, just that both Rangers and Bards get an extra skill point or two per level (it's all on page 13 of the thread). Of course, some dialogues will differ according to class, alignment, stats, feats and skills, but that's only to be expected. All part of the enjoyment!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

Thank you for such great info and a great forum.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have always been used to playing a Ranger or Rogue type char so I wanted to try something outside of my comfort zone and seen Empyre's great Weaponmaster builds earlier in this thread so going to give the one with Knockdown a go.<br/>\nI just completed the Pennisula area of the OC and nicely equipped with a Greatsword +1 that I got from the Pits.\u00a0 My issue is I am not familiar with the class so I am going back and forth on what armor I should be wearing.\u00a0 Currently I have Chain Mail which is med armor but it seems like I should probably be shooting for heavy armor right?\u00a0 Or is this character build meant to be more agile?\u00a0 Sorry if this is a dumb question, like I said its a been a while since I have played this great game and when I did I never played WM.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any feedback you can offer and thank you again for the great builds here.

Maybe a Ranger/Fighter or something. I have found a couple Ranger/Rogue/Assassin with duel wield or bows.<br/>\nI know Rangers and bows go hand in hand and I play that kind of build alot but would like to make one that focuses on 2H sword and maybe a bow as a back up ranged weapon.\u00a0 Of course most of the things I want to play are not really \"proper\" builds in most peoples eyes, especially for those who enjoy Min/Max game play.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I will play through that other module you mentioned, Mines of Twin Summit.
