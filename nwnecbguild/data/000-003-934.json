Why did you choose specifically 15 levels of Cleric?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a level 20 build with 15 levels of Cleric, I recommend Cleric 15 / Fighter 2 / Rogue 3, but the OC will only take you to level 18, and the 18th level is not guaranteed. For a Cleric for the OC with the number of Cleric levels unspecified, I would play a Cleric 18 / Fighter 2.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It is a love story between your PC and Aribeth, so you need to be male, a Human, Elf, or Half-Elf, and you need to be as close to Lawful Good as possible. Chaotic Good works, though. There is a lot of dialog at the beginning for the trial and to set up the story, but after that, there is a lot of action, not boring at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless I misinterpreted what I was told, the old trick of using Divine Power to get your 4th attack at full AB has been patched out in EE. I propose to make you a level 28 build for the OC plus Aribeth's Redemption which will also work for the OC by itself. At level 18, where the OC ends, he will be Cleric 16 / Fighter 2, with the 16th level of Cleric giving you a couple more spells per day. At level 20, Cleric 16 / Fighter 4 with Weapon Spec and 4 attacks per round without a spell needed to grant it, and at level 28, Cleric 20\u00a0 / Fighter 8, for maximum spells-per-day and 2 more Fighter feats. How does that sound?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

However, without Sneak Attack, I don't think stealth would help you in any way, except to help you escape if you get in trouble. To get SD, you would sacrifice 2 feats for Dodge and Mobility (requiring more DEX than I had planned), and cross-train a lot of points into Hide and Move Silently. If Tumble is the main reason for adding SD, then how about Cleric 17 / Fighter 6 / Rogue 5?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
