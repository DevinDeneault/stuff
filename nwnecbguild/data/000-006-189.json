He must<br/>\n suffer the damage of those attackers that will not succumb<br/>\n to leg shots.\u00a0 Wulgar handles this pressure quite well, in part<br/>\n with HP much higher than a standard archer<br/>\n (or AA, for that matter) and also the DR never expires.<br/>\n<br/>\n I've been saving the Harper skills for boss encounters and<br/>\n relying on just the Cat pots for a regular DEX boost.\u00a0 The<br/>\n only limitation so far is that we play mainly low-mid magic<br/>\n so no higher than mighty +3 are sold.\u00a0 It doesn't seem to<br/>\n matter though.\u00a0 There is a good assortment of fire, ice,<br/>\n electrical and acid enhancements on the arrows (once you<br/>\n can afford them).\u00a0 They are only d4 arrows but hit on<br/>\n most attacks.</td><td><img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://i1132.photobucket.com/albums/m573/HipMaestro/wulgar_ironbow_zps9zemsznd.png\" /></td></tr></tbody></table>\n<strong>PROs</strong> <ul><li>Equal efficiency with ranged or melee attacks.</li> <li>Exceptional and versatile party toon, but can solo with some micromanagement.</li> <li>Pulling ability is excellent.\u00a0 Most closers never make it within melee switch range.</li> <li>Either robes or heavy plate armor work fine though robes are preferred in later epic levels.</li> <li>The archery skill assures that most elemental resistances can be bypassed just by swapping ammo.</li> <li>Both attacks have high-damage crits for a DEX build.</li> <li>Wulgar doesn't miss often ranged or melee.</li> </ul>\n<strong>CONs</strong> <ul><li>No Epic Dodge.\u00a0 That's a rogue or monk/SD combo so cannot be a factor here.</li> <li>No UMD.\u00a0 My archers are most often summoners so must learn a different pace with this guy.</li> <li>Without sneaks or AA boosts the toon is fairly dependent on mighty bows for consistent damage.</li> <li>Trap detection is... well... pretty lean except for those placed underground and with some help from Harper skill.</li> <li>Specializing in 2 weapons leaves it a bit feat-starved.\u00a0 Hence, no room for handaxe ImpCrit without sacrificing more valuable feats.</li> </ul>\nSimilar Builds<br/>\n None.\u00a0 Fighter DwDs tend to use monk, rogue, SD or even assassin for tertiary.\u00a0 Of those listed, none focus on ranged attacks as the primary attack.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:120%;line-height:normal\"><strong>Wulgar \"Death's Eye\" Ironbow</strong></span><br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\n<br/>\n His father Wuldan became the original archer of the mountain.\u00a0 Out of necessity and innovation rather than custom.<br/>\n<br/>\n Of the three sons only the youngest, Wulgar, remained behind with his sire at the original homestead.\u00a0 The brothers had trekked South years before to join the mining clans ripe with plans to advance their personal fortunes by the trade of rare ores and forged weaponry, armor, implements and jewelry... skills more typical of his race.\u00a0 The castles and towns populating the southern vastness provided an almost endless opportunity for rich dwarven commerce.<br/>\n<br/>\n The home sat at the foot of the Kharak, the mountain range which guarded the woodlands from the constant threat trickling down, almost daily, from the flatlands beyond the tor.\u00a0 When snaring squirrels and rabbits in the surrounding woodlands became too tedious and distasteful, Wulgar's father sought to harvest from the abundant venison herds, mostly red deer and elk, that roamed freely through the overgrowth of oak, birch and poplar forests that crept up the mountain side.\u00a0 There was no way to outrun the beasts to slay them with his cleaver, even on horseback, so Wuldan began devising bows by smelting and forging ores rendered from the mine fronted by his home.\u00a0 A powerful propelling force was generated by laminating iron straps together sandwiched with one or more rare metals, some with magical properties.\u00a0 Thus it was that the first iron-composite bows became indoctrinated as a blood legacy. In time, the craftsmanship improved with the advent of rare alloys and clever forging techniques.<br/>\n<br/>\n Delved into the mountain shoulder, the rock facade that faced the forest obscured the cavern within, a dwarven deep that housed a foundry and stocks.\u00a0 Through a vertical surface shaft that extended into the caves below, the heat and smoke of the hearth was vented and yet another portal farther back erupted upward from the chief furnace.\u00a0 Other similar shafts stepped gradually up the escarpment providing skylights that allowed filtered light to penetrate into the deepest recesses of the underground fortress.\u00a0 Smelting and forging activity was limited to the blackest hours of night in order to secure the habitation, a danger that the smokes and fumes wafting through the sky would surely reveal to passing adventurers.<br/>\n<br/>\n The entire scree around the entrances (there were three in all) was strewn with many sizes of easily-dislodged, smooth, rounded boulders, all individually-hewn by Wuldan and his sons... an engineered hazard to prevent egression over the peak from all except an occasional sure-footed goat seeking scraps of grazing.\u00a0 It had become a periodic task for the sons to maintain the avalanche zone, replacing the stone arrangements when disturbed, to the bane of intruders unfamiliar with the area. The tumbling alert always gave rise to a hail of arrows that never missed.\u00a0 Staked orc and goblin heads at the slope's crest warned the reckless and unwary.\u00a0 Even so, unmarked graves of stubborn trespassers dotted the underbrush for miles around just a few feet under tread while the invasive grasses grew to obscure evidence of any freshly-disturbed soil. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n But there was little trade for the metal bows crafted by Wulgar's family, stifling any possible windfalls.\u00a0 The weapons were far to heavy for any but dwarves to heft and string (the bowstring was actually resilient wire composed of a rare ore only procured in the South) so the market was small.\u00a0 Few dwarves ever considered investing their purse into one of the craft's expensive bows and only the most burly human warrior could hope to carry and manipulate the powerful limbs that could pierce armor from over 200 meters away.\u00a0 Those with brutish orc blood never made it within safe bartering range.<br/>\n<br/>\n So began Wulgar Ironbow's reputation and career as a mercenary for hire.\u00a0 His uncanny, glowing eyes and vast targeting expertise became so renowned that rumors of a possible elvish blood influence surfaced, much to Wulgar's displeasure.\u00a0\u00a0 No one has ever discovered the source of any of these ill-advised conjectures.\u00a0 Ironically though, his father Wuldan never forcefully denied the claim.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Fighter(16), Dwarven Defender(19), Harper Scout(5), </strong>Any lawful and non-evil Dwarf<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 14<br/>\n DEX: 18 (34)<br/>\n CON: 12<br/>\n WIS: 8<br/>\n INT: 14<br/>\n CHA: 6<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Ftr(1): Weapon Finesse, WF: Longbow<br/>\n 02: Ftr(2): WF: Handaxe<br/>\n 03: Ftr(3): Point Blank Shot<br/>\n 04: Ftr(4): DEX+1 (19), WS: Longbow<br/>\n 05: Ftr(5)<br/>\n 06: Ftr(6): Rapid Shot, WS: Handaxe<br/>\n 07: Ftr(7)<br/>\n 08: Ftr(8): DEX+1 (20), ImpCrit: Longbow<br/>\n 09: Ftr(9): Toughness<br/>\n 10: Ftr(10): Dodge<br/>\n 11: DwD(1)<br/>\n 12: DwD(2): DEX+1 (21), Called Shot<br/>\n 13: DwD(3)<br/>\n 14: DwD(4)<br/>\n 15: DwD(5): Iron Will<br/>\n 16: DwD(6): DEX+1 (22)<br/>\n 17: Ftr(11)<br/>\n 18: Ftr(12): Alertness, Blind Fight<br/>\n 19: Ftr(13)<br/>\n 20: Ftr(14): DEX+1 (23), Knockdown<br/>\n 21: HS(1): EWF: Longbow, Grt DEX (24)<br/>\n 22: DwD(7)<br/>\n 23: DwD(8)<br/>\n 24: DwD(9): DEX+1 (25), EWF: Handaxe<br/>\n 25: DwD(10)<br/>\n 26: DwD(11)<br/>\n 27: HS(2): Grt DEX (26)<br/>\n 28: DwD(12): DEX+1 (27)<br/>\n 29: DwD(13)<br/>\n 30: Ftr(15): EWS: Longbow<br/>\n 31: Ftr(16): EWS: Handaxe<br/>\n 32: HS(3): DEX+1 (28)<br/>\n 33: DwD(14): Grt DEX (29), Armor Skin<br/>\n 34: DwD(15)<br/>\n 35: DwD(16)<br/>\n 36: DwD(17): DEX+1 (30), Grt DEX (31)<br/>\n 37: HS(4)<br/>\n 38: DwD(18): Epic Prowess<br/>\n 39: HS(5): Grt DEX x2 (32,33)<br/>\n 40: DwD(19): DEX+1 (34)<br/>\n<br/>\n HP(max): 498<br/>\n Saves F/W/R: 25/20/28 (31/26/34 v spells);

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Sorry, have a build question already. I understand what you say about Imp Crit: Handaxe, but would it not be worth dropping KD for it? My rationale for the question is that Called Shot will also work for melee weapons (either slowing or hampering foes' attacks) and has, effectively, the same attack penalty as KD. Admittedly, not as useful against mages, but if I'm tanking with Wulgar when mages are hovering behind the mob, maybe I wouldn't be using him right (and, of course, if I am using his archery skills against said mages, KD is the last thing I'd want). Or am I missing something?<br/>\n<br/>\n And I promise it's not just me being anti-KD - it's a genuine question!<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

They can pick up the bow for practice in their leisure and not fret much about the loss of a shield's AC.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n TBH, Wulgar very seldom uses his axe for more than chopping kindling or mage necks when I play him so the damage becomes secondary. Just whack 'em down an step on their face. With all his DR, he can stand there without a shield firing in PBS mode without much anxiety at all when it comes to handling flankers.<br/>\n<br/>\n BTW, if you get in the habit of allowing mages to \"hover\", you are asking for trouble. It's always better to rush them with your axe, hasted if possible, and let their minions pelt you with blows. Always strike at the greatest threat first or you will provide them with the one element they relish... TIME!\u00a0 Once you get that extra damage from EWS, it's more likely you'll be able to interrupt their plans, but even then, don't count on it. This is not an AA who specializes in ruining mages' lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, one other tip:\u00a0 if you finally reach your mage target and find you've provided enough time for those nasty damage shields to fly up in full glory, pull out the bow and begin plunking away at PBS distance.\u00a0 You'll get no recipro damage and the melee range tends to make NPC mage AI confused and PC mages a bit nervous.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
