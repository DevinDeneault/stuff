      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">While testing out Arvoreen's Silent Sting (Monk 21/Rogue 13/CoT 6), I thought about drawing up her antithesis: that is, where she's in and out of shadow, crippling and throwing multiple attacks out: what about someone who's just stuck in tar, shrugging and saying, \"Not hard enough, idiot. Try again,\" ad infinitum? In other words a Dwarven Defender. So I had a look around and came across <strong>Grizzled Dwarflord's</strong> <strong>Hearth Guard</strong> <strong>(DwD 22/CoT 10/Fighter 8)</strong> in the legacy archive. That looked lovely, but I wondered about some of the feats, and have always liked being skilled in 2 different weapon types (in this instance, slashing and bludgeoning), so looked at a few minor tweaks - effectively, a new lick of paint and some varnishing. At that point, I ran into some questions. These are detailed below, together with the ensuing discussions.

Conversely, you won't find any Dwarven Waraxes in the OC, so you might find that WProf: Exotic is an unnecessary feat. In which case, go for Battleaxe and Heavy Flail (with its 1.5 damage) and take either Power Attack instead of Exotic WProf and then Cleave instead of the second Imp Crit, or just add in Disarm for use with your 2-hander. But you'll know what you can unearth and make good use of where you play. Equally, do feel free to swap Blind Fight and Knockdown around, and, if AC is your priority, switch Armor Skin with Epic Prowess. If taunting is an issue, the lack of Concentration may be an problem, but hey, only 129 SPs!<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>My initial queries fell into three categories: Feats, Saves and Skills.</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"color:#000000\">Feats.</span></strong> Cleave (and by default, Power Attack) was something I realised I was missing, and if I'm right the Cleaving doesn't interrupt Defensive Stance, would I be a fool not to take it? Given that it's effectively 2 feats, I reckon Iron Will and IKD are the most vulnerable. What do you think? Another way to go that allows me to keep IKD would be to take Fighter 8 at level 20, but that would mean losing one bonus feat in epic - either AS or EP would be my guess. All these seem to have pluses and minuses - what does the Guild think?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Saves.</strong> I appear to have gone \"save-blind\". I did two sets of calculations on \"straight\" saves, and got F36/W27/R26 in one, and F37/W24/R22 in the other (both with my red changes implemented). Neither of which tallies with the Dwarflord's F36/W24/R24. Could you help, please?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Skills.</strong> Massively skill-starved (only 129 points). I thought I'd go with Conc 8 (14), Disc 43 (52), Spell 19 (20), Tumble 20 (21), but this leaves me with a big fat 0 in detection (Listen, Spot, or even Search). To some extent it bothers me less in this build - I don't plan to be sneaking after enemies, I shall be beckoning them to me (I like the company) - but I wondered whether I could get INT to 14 without collapsing the build. The only way I can see it is to drop CON to 21, which is all you need for EDRIII, and start it at 17. I could then move out a pre-epic STR boost to CON and take the final (level 40) boost as STR. That would also mean I could bump WIS by 2 at creation, upping Will saves by 1. However, it would also drop Fort by 1 and HPs by 40. Or should I just bite the bullet? Any thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n Maybe this is all a bit anal of me, but I really would value your thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\n Btw, there were of course, other DwD builds out there that I looked at, but I really liked the underpinning principles of this one, and thought it deserved updating to v1.69. I hope this attempt achieves that.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You need not hunt to find them.\u00a0 They will find you. Figure on getting spammed by lots of sneak damage if you can't hear them approaching.\u00a0 Spot will only help in the rare instance that you happen to chose to set up your combat stance directly in a nest of hiding rogues/assassins shoulder-to-shoulder.\u00a0 It could happen, I suppose, but in PvM the AI will typically cause them to move towards you long before you get that close.\u00a0 The exception would be hiding rogue archers which don't need to move and won't except to maintain LOS.\u00a0 Hence, the benefit of maxing both detection skills... but melee sneakers in motion seems to be more prevalent than occasional ranged attacks to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n Since your saves are very good anyway, my personal bias would induce me to take exotic for Dwarven Waraxe, the best 1H weapon available. Cost: Iron Will. Use Clarity (short term) and/or Owl pots (long term) for your Will concerns.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'll try to check your bean-counting upon return.\u00a0 I do like the build's main notion, though.\u00a0 It looks like a worthwhile adjunct to GDL's version.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks, Hip.<br/>\n<br/>\n I are a plank. I'd been using eyes (or ears) that merely saw (or heard) me being aware of foes earlier and therefore better positioned to attack, rather than \"here come the rat-bastards, ready yourself.\" Offense rather defense (I even used NFL spelling), which kind of defeats the point of this build. And, given the option, I's always go Listen over Spot (I know there's a discussion about the various merits on another subforum). It does, however, leave me with a quandry - what to drop? My thinking is Spellcraft, given that I get natural Dwarven bonuses v Spells anyway. Iirc, Listen is governed by INT (though it could be WIS), so I could get to 43 (44 or 42, depending), which would drop Conc to 3 (9) - or I could take a little Lore for Conc and save a few bucks. After all, no decent taunt is going be saved by that level of Conc. Or mix and match is available, I suppose. I know what you say about archers, but I'd really hope for someone to help there (not necessarily looking for this to solo much).<br/>\n<br/>\n I'd actually opted for Exotic Prof and Dwarven Waraxe initially, but it's such a flighty thing - you might never find one worth the having, or you might find eight and kick yourself - that I ended up going standard Battleaxe. Of course, if I was going for \"best\" weapons, scimitars and large flails spring to mind (I can see the debate starting now...), but I also fancied the idea of \"proper\" Dwarf weapons featuring. It irks somewhat to have a dwarf take another proficiency for a weapon that should seem like second nature, but rules is rules I suppose...<br/>\n<br/>\n I know I tend towards high Will saves in particular. It's not just an Aielund thing, I hate being rendered useless, and - given my tendency to play meleers - Will failures tend to hit harder than others, so I try to counteract them if I can.<br/>\n<br/>\n I eagerly await further analysis (RL permitting) - but am currently off to meet Deekin in a Gnoll-infested village with the Silent Sting.<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and Grizzled Dwarflord gives a marvellous back-story for his build, if anyone wants to check it out, regardless of the build itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'll be taking Power Attack and Cleave now, dropping the second Imp Crit and Iron Will. I see this build as being about doing the simple things, but doing them well. The high HPs and DR will compensate for the lack of shield later on. On balance, I think I'll stick with Battleaxe for the other weapon - although I now find I'm being tempted by Great Axe. There are a couple of lovely Mauls in Aielund, but you can't focus in them, and the only way to use them at all - without UMD - is with Exotic Proficiency, but I digress, and I wouldn't want weapon choice to be a deal-breaker.<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Hip - On the saves, I suspect I'd somehow woven the racial bonus versus spells into my own calculation - thanks for clearing it up. Also for saving me from doing the AC calculation. As to the skills, I'll just grin and bear it with 129 points, maxing Discipline and Listen, and cross-classing Tumble to 20. This will leave a hefty 3 points for folk to do with as they choose. At least Stonecunning will give me a small chance of avoiding early traps underground, and the skills schedule shouldn't be too problematic to work out, which is a form of blessing.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, I'm not sure what to do with the finished article (when it <em>is</em> finished, that is). Would it be appropriate to publish it as a tribute to GDL's build, or should I just leave it here? I'm certainly not looking for any glory from it, and I don't think the differences are sufficient to claim it as my own.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Just by way of an update on testing both this and the Silent Sting build, I find I've run into bother with both. Not the builds themselves, I hasten to add, just me being me. With this chap, my intention was to run him through the OC and Aribeth's Redemption before tackling Sands of Fate. Having just finished the Host Tower in Luskan, I realised that a Dwarf wouldn't be able to do the Aribeth mods. Arse. Also, interestingly enough, he's performing consistently at a better level with Heavy Flail than hunkering down with his Battleaxe behind a shield. That said, I'm still only running at baby levels of DwD, so perhaps not too surprising.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for Arvoreen's Silent Sting (I know, a different thread, but still mine, so I feel justified-ish), it's been harder work. I'm going through SoU with her at the moment (struggled hugely with Kel-Garas) and have just reached Undrentide. One of the issues is purely mine - I'm so used to being up front and personal that I really need to think hard about the covert stuff. The other issue is linked, in a way, in that it concerns henchies. My understanding is that Tony K's AI makes things a lot better, but as it stands, it's all very well me disappearing into the shadows and doling out deadly strikes, but my thicko companion just keeps getting butchered. I suspect that in all 3 of original series, if you want to travel with a companion, be careful which idiot you go with. Even Deekin's letting me down, for gods' sake!<br/>\n<br/>\n Hope everyone's well.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I suppose there should have been a clue in the \"Am I a pally - am I a blackguard - am I a pally?\" routine (despite Nasher's assertion that such character changes would seem impossible for an Elf). Alas, though, this is about the script for Hairybreast's Redemption. It won't matter that I've romanced and saved her bony ass - and been LG throughout (done it before as a bearded wonder), the mods are only geared for Elf, Half-Elf or Human Good aligned characters. Looks like I'll have to skip into HotU instead to get to L28 before Sands of Fate. I know there'll be assorted disconnections/contrariness, but this is only a test-run, after all, and I plan on following on with Aielund (was going to be Swordflight, but it won't get me high enough yet).<br/>\n<br/>\n Ah, henchmen. Lovely idea, some great conversations, but the bog-standard ones are really frustrating. I generally solo the 3 official campaigns now, but thought I'd try a companion with the Silent Sting (feeling a little insecure about playing a Dexer, I suppose). One is severely limited in SoU, particularly with one of the three options being a Rogue who's worse at it than me, but Linu and Daelan become available once more in HotU - though loyalty being loyalty, I'll probably stick with Deekin.<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and my trap setting is coming on well, except half the time my own hench is setting them off! Thus, I hear what you say about just parking them up. Life, eh?</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
