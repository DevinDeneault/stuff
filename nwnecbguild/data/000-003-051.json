I've got one for you to work on.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbarian for Arelith.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Must have specs:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nMin 16 lvls of Barb (to take full advantage of Arelith specific barb buffs)\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo handed weapon (Personally I think the great axe is more \"barby\" but thats not a must have. I can be convinced otherwise)<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\nTerror, and Thundering Rage<br/>\n<br/>\nAs much con as possible\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nDwarf or Half Orc will most likely be taken to help with str/con needs<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Wishlist</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nSkill points! He's gonna need lots of intimidate and perhaps even taunt, I mean....why not taunt amirite? ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nUMD.....lets face it.....on a low lvl magic server, its damn near a requirement for any build<br/>\n<br/>\nDR feats would be nice if they could be squeezed in?<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe Weapon Specialization?<br/>\n<br/>\nThats it.... or at least all I can think of at the moment. I was thinking maybe start with 3 levels of rouge right out of the gate, then perhaps 16 barb levels, one more rogue, followed by 4 ftr lvls to squeeze in epic weapon spec at lvl 24, then finish off the last levels with all rogue for more tumble and such. But you're the experts here.\u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>It's not much, just something to get you started, but here is a Barbarian for Arelith that get's 11 out of 12 Rages (if i read that correctly in Arelith's Wiki), loads of HP's, Epic Weapon Specialization, UMD, Lot's of Skills and some good combat feats to keep you alive. I am mainly concerned about his low-ish AB but i saw the the custom bonusses for Rage and those are mighty indeed. This is an easy-of-use stat array but if you want to extract every ounce of power out of that you can opt for more hardcore stat allocation and get to higher STR/CON. I stayed away from the wall-known Barb/Bard/RDD combo because i know that in Arelith you need special permission to do that.
