The OC and SoU happen at the same time to two different heroes, and they both start at level 1. HotU follows SoU.<br/>\n I'd take one build through the OC and the Aribeth's Redemption series, an action adventure / love story between your character and Aribeth that takes you to about level 27.<br/>\n Then play a <strong>different build</strong> in SoU, then a bridge module like The Nether Scrolls (a great module, but optional), and then HotU, and finally the Sands of Fate series, which will take you all the way to level 40.<br/>\n You mentioned the Aielund Saga, and I wholeheartedly agree. It's a must-play, and it will take you from level 1 to level 36.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Better to go the well-rounded shifter and learn how to use all the special abilities before deciding on a specialty.\u00a0 I've played scores of shifters in diverse environments and they can at least be a handy party member vs. certain kinds of attacks (like vs. mobs of greater basilisks and medusae).<br/>\n<br/>\n @Mr. Dagger: a cleric 10+/shifter will hold its own very well solo in mid-magic.\u00a0 Risen Lord's +5 scythe and every shape using creature weapons will pierce stoneskin (et al.) when buffed with same.\u00a0 Also, Rak's unlimited ice storms is nothing to sneeze at.<br/>\n<br/>\n edit: BTW, there is a challenging way to play OC-HotU combo.\u00a0 After completing the OC, use a trainer (or just before your last character export in OC, execute console control) to de-level to 14-15.\u00a0 That will hit HotU about right and allow your toon to party up with Deekin before he mucks up his bardic prowess with RDD levels.\u00a0 <strong>Lasting Inspiration</strong> Rocks! :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Wisdom based monk\u00a0build\u00a0is\u00a0an exception, especially when buffed to max with owls insight. Shifter builds suffer from a low BAB and have few ways of buffing AB, unless the shape has a high inherent AB, like the dragon shape<br/>\n Clerics are almost always overpowered, especially pre-epic and in low-/ mid-magic environments<br/>\n I agree with you that some focused shifter builds can be very powerful, and even more so in low-/ mid-magic settings. I\u00a0will add the kobold/assassin to the list. It has HIPS and\u00a0a +10 bonus to\u00a0both stealth skills.\u00a0It can be strength based since the shape does not override strength, for\u00a0a higher\u00a0AB and dev crit, or intelligence based for an unbuffed DA DC of 48-49\u00a0and skillpoints galore.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

With any toon you want.\u00a0 Is the background necessary for HotU? Meh.\u00a0 Once you've played through SoU once you'll get the gist.\u00a0 SoU is particularly unforgiving and tedious for intentionally-gimped pre-epic builds preparing for epic superiority.<br/>\n<br/>\n Deekin treats any toon as a long, lost pal. The convos are written that way.\u00a0 There are no convo variables set on the PC that are carried forth from SoU to HotU.\u00a0 It's the OC-based henchmen that seem to be suffering from amnesia and some continuance of their backstories.<br/>\n<br/>\n Besides, the campaigns are easy enough to serve as a good mid-level testing ground for build concepts being considered for PWs and harder environments.\u00a0 Gotta start somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n It really doesn't matter where you pull your pre-designed toon from for HotU as long as the level approximates what comes out of SoU... like I said 14-15 is about right.<br/>\n Even if SoU produces a lower level toon (if you skip through some of SoU sidequests, for example), the HotU starting script will autolevel up to... ummm... I think it's Level 15<br/>\n but haven't opened HotU with a low-level toon in a long time so forget the target level.\u00a0 De-level an SoU toon to begin the OC?\u00a0 Sorry. I don't get the point.\u00a0 <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\n @Mick:\u00a0 ....that's the reason for the cleric/shifter concept which I haven't tried before and has been working extremely well.\u00a0 It's all about buffs.\u00a0 I settled on a dexer Risen Lord which gains at least +10 dex AC, AC that cannot be lost when flanked since it is part of the merge.\u00a0 AC total with the equipment from OC-HotU produces a buffed defense around 55-58 AC depending on when the buffs begin to fall off.\u00a0 That seems more than enough for any mid-magic settings, especially when you factor in the crit/sneak immunity.\u00a0 The monk shifter is so prescription and stale I don't even consider it anymore.\u00a0 But that's me.\u00a0 Neophyte shifters need lots of play-testing to learn all the special abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n Divine Power, Divine Favor and Empowered Bull's (not to mention those inappropriate +10 weapons that take most of the challenge away) raise the BAB/AB near to around a pure fighter's. Full BAB free attacks from haste or DP function just the same as any non-morphing toon so it hits a lot with scary damage.\u00a0 Notice that I do not compare it to WM AB. But then again, I don't know of any Palemaster/WM builds for the immunities.\u00a0 If there are, they probably use daggers :P<br/>\n<br/>\n The only problem I have testing RL in SP is that I cannot party with a magic user to inflict critical wounds or target my RL with NER/NEB when the health falls, which isn't very often. Don't like to keep morphing and remorphing during combat just to heal.\u00a0 Of course, when I spot cleric mobs, the bane of all RLs, I unmorph quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\n Don't know how much you folks have played dragon shape, but I hate it.\u00a0 That fat draconic butt is always getting stuck and impeded underground and inside buildings.\u00a0 Even iron golem is no picnic to navigate around your own party trying to stay in effective tanking position. IMO those are outdoor-only shapes. Thax always seemed to have success designing/playing with elder elementals and other unarmed forms, but I found them very limited and unprepared to hit enemies without the weapon merge (like you explained).\u00a0 The dragon's +6 claws do doodly squat vs. Epic Warding.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

When you are playing single-player, don't design your build for level 40 supremacy because most of the time, you will not be at level 40. Make the build playable throughout, and SoU will be as fun as the rest of the chain of campaigns (SoU, Elder Scrolls [optional, but fun], HotU, Sands of Fate). The OC is fun, too, but if you follow it with HotU, you're doing it wrong.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
