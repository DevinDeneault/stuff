      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Orion,<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the 2nd fighter level is pushed to 39, you could shuffle some skill points around for a higher discipline. It would delay EDR III, but the reduced vulnerability to knockdown would probably be worth it, but that's my opinion, YMMV.<br/>\n<br/>\nI normally only take enough ranks in craft weapon to get the large bones too drop from skeletons to make wands, in environments where that's not available. For this build, you only need 2 ranks, unless you're going for something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI normally only invest 10 ranks in lore. Works wonders at the early levels and not needed as much at higher levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou're right about the Mord's resistance. The breach part will still happen, but it takes a level 27 caster to have a 5% chance of dispelling other effects with Mord's. A UMD user will be unable to dispel your non-beach-able buffs. This means you have haste, expeditious, and improved invisibility (to name a few) AFTER the Mord's from martial casters (caster level 26 or below)/UMD'rs. So no, the dreaded Nightshade cannot take your haste/invis/expeditious/bull's/fox's/et al.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, a very solid caster wizard build.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks Ten Pura for your suggestions<br/>\n<br/>\nI think pushing back the fighter level is an excellent idea. This guy is still gonna be knocked down regularly in caster mode unless he has knockdown immune boots/other item, however if he polymorphs I believe his Iron Golem form with damage shields up is going to have some resistance to knockdown. It could help a little against called shots on second to fifth attacks.<br/>\nThanks for educating me on the craft weapon for wands, I've made the adjustments.<br/>\nI pumped lore up but that's because I wasn't sure what else to do with the skill points, I've left it at *only* 12(25) which can be buffed with spells of course.<br/>\nThanks for crunching the numbers with the dispels. For me it was just more a feel thing whilst playing, like it felt x caster levels was Mord resistant, without fully understanding the mechanics.<br/>\nThe reason why I like some resistance to Mords from UMD casters is that it is easy for module creators to generate random Mords scrolls on enemies to remove all your buffs.<br/>\nThe Dreaded Nightshade (High ISR Monk/SD/Assassin) is going to be annoying for sure, if this fellow were to face her.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

But that will need som reworking and less DC for more AC.<br/>\nThe skill table can be fine tuned some, especially how far you want to go with trap skills. UMD 33 is for care free spell casting from scrolls. I am not sure if you need that with a wizard. The UMD target for items depends on the level of magic item properties.<br/>\nAll in all a nice build!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">GDL,<br/>\nIn wizard builds, I sometimes take SF: Evocation, but early. As you stated, most of the best Evocation spells don't have a save, but until the wizard grows into those, the SF: Evocation can help those Burning Hands or Scintillating Spheres land.<br/>\n<br/>\nLikewise, Tasha's is amazing at low levels, but increased availability of immunity to mind spells, combined with basically every boss ever having immunity to mind spells makes later Enchantment school spells mostly useless.<br/>\n<br/>\nConversely, Necromancy doesn't start to shine until mid to late wizard levels, and continues to be the reason that immunity to death magic is highly desirable.<br/>\n<br/>\nConjuration is situationally useful. Grease is effective against high-SR creatures (even SR 67+). Web, Flame Arrow, and Stinking Cloud are also situationally useful, but above level 3, the effects of improved DC's for Conjuration become less significant. No one with 7+ hit dice makes a save against Cloudkill. Acid Fog allows a save to resist the slow effect, doesn't change the damage. Meanwhile, the Planar Binding spells only have a save when binding a single outsider (Dismissal is generally better at this). I would only recommend a Conjuration focus if facing enemies with significant SR, especially hordes of outsiders with significant SR.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the remaining schools, Divination only has Feeblemind. Abjuration has Dismissal and Banishment. Illusion has Weird, but immunity to fear stops it, and same with Phantasmal Killer. Transmutation has Flesh to Stone and Slow.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a note for other readers, these recommendations are for arcane spell casters. Divine Casters can get some milage out of a +6 DC Implosion (Evocation) or Storm of Vengeance (Conjuration).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn't to say that a character can't be built differently, but if you're looking for the TL;DR version: take ESF: Necromancy; don't invest in the others.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

At least the d4 hit die issue with wizards is mitigated by this.\u00a0<br/>\nStill/Auto Still I-III is also a very good choice if one wishes to equip armor/shield to boost AC up, I haven't pursued it due to the base Str 7 and the lack of feats remaining but that is an alternative to boost AC up. If one has a socket item component to the module/PW, sometimes items can be socketed to have low arcane spell failure and weight. If all else fails maybe an elven chainmail or chain shirt might help if more AC is desired.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nGDL - would be delighted to see your draft if you have the time to post it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the DC Evocation spells are somewhat lacklustre it doesn't seem sensible to overly invest in them<br/>\nI would have thought Incendiary Cloud/Sunburst, Meteor Swarm, Delayed Blast Fireball etc might be useful but sometimes one gets surprises in life.\u00a0<br/>\nI presume at high levels the damage output is simply not enough, it looks like a lot of the damage is capped at 20d6-25d6 and one is better off spamming that wand of ILMS.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also realised is with 35 caster levels is that I can drop extend spell for another spell focus feat.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI can rearrange things so that this SF/GSF can be conjuration (for useful crowd control spells -&gt; grease/web/stinking cloud, and evards/flame arrow DC boosts), and the SF can be enchantment (charm, hold, mind fog, dominate monster) and drop Evocation as a spell focus given enough damage can be dealt no save spells like ILMS and IGMS and Evards.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat gives the build SF/GSF: Necromancy and Conjuration, and SF: Enchantment and SF: Illusion (free from gnome)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think?\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I've got this guy to level 8 with playtesting, and the HP + survivability makes this guy feel like an 'Iron Cannon' rather than a Glass one.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
