Constantly going on a journey of survival and fun.<br/>\n Due to recent events with his rival, our hero met a tragic end. But, it doesn't end there. Though, that journey is done a new one begins from the shadows.<br/>\n That said player character has made their way to the Nwnecbguild.forums, to gain help making a new idea he had in mind, and to deliver a lame rip off opening...</strong></span></em><br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div>\n\u00a0Well.. .glad we got that out of the way xD.<br/>\n Please rate :o xD<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, I came from Arelith (lv 30). I decided to try and make a necromancer (spell casting focus) and... I thought about using Cleric as one (but correct me if there is a better choice)<br/>\n Okay so let's lay it down right here ^^<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>PvM or PvP - PvM, but any help towards PvP (in the odd case I get attacked, might help)<br/>\n Level cap - 30<br/>\n Race- Human<br/>\n Class - Wizard or Cleric. -Reason? I thought the cleric might make a better necromancer due to having inflict damage spells, alongside the seemingly standard negative rays, etc. But, wizards got horrid, and kinda fit the... missiles fireballs...thing.<br/>\n -Melee Preference - None<br/>\n Range - none<br/>\n<br/>\n Skills - A high heal might help. Spot might also, against stealthed foes? Maybe<br/>\n Weapon - Always thought it would be cool to run around with a scythe (Grim Reaper style, but that's just me, not mandatory if it hinders build)<br/>\n<br/>\n Maximum item enchantment - Any of the basic stats such as STR, DEX, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n Spell Casting? - I wanted it to be able to cast strong offensive spells (whilst remain true to the necromantic ways. Probably nothing like disease since it might be an easy resist, but negative energies, undead minions and missiles etc.)<br/>\n<br/>\n Level Constraints - 3 in a row, before moving to another class<br/>\n Class restrants? - Can't use a palemaster for this one (however, a second build with palemaster in it for if I ever unlock it would be awesome ^^)<br/>\n Classes that can be used?</em><br/>\n Arcane Archer<br/>\n Blackguard<br/>\n Champion of Torm<br/>\n Dwarven Defender<br/>\n Shadowdancer<br/>\n Weapon Master<br/>\n Others under heavy restriction or rewards.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Changes in Spells or feats?</em><br/>\n<strong>Epic Spell: Mummy Dust</strong>: Having this feat will grant access to the strongest variants of undead as per the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Spell_changes#Necromancy_changes\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">undead summoning changes</a>, but the spell by itself only works as any other undead summoning spell (It does not summon the mummy warrior)Undead summoning spells no longer summon a specific creature tied to that spell, instead, all of these spells will summon creatures of power directly tied to a secondary undead caster level, henceforth UCL. <ul><li>The UCL is either your full cleric levels, <strong>or</strong> your added total of wizard, sorcerer and pale master levels.</li> <li>Once taking the feat Mummy Dust, all undead will be tier 4, not just those summoned by Mummy Dust. By itself, Mummy Dust does not summon any special creature, but will act exactly like any other undead summoning spell.</li> <li>The minions must be summoned from different spells; casting Animate Twice twice won't net you a second minion.</li> </ul><ul><li>This means, to achieve three undead you would have to cast Animate Dead, Create Undead and Mummy Dust, for example.</li> <li><strong>Spell Focus: Necromancy</strong></li> </ul><ul><li>Greater Spell Focus: Necromancy turns Summoned Undead (from any Spell, Class Ability or Feat) into Henchmen. Your character may therefore have two undead minions at the same time. Note that the undeads <strong>must</strong> be summoned from different sources; casting two times Create Undead will not result in two minions.</li> <li>Epic Spell Focus: Necromancy will allow the caster to have three summoned undead at the same time.</li> </ul><strong>Spell Focus: Abjuration</strong> <ul><li>Each Spell Focus in Abjuration grants a cumulative +2 to Dispelling Rolls, to a total of +6 with Epic Spell Focus: Abjuration. These are applied after the Level Cap imposed by individual spells (so an Epic Abjurer's Greater Dispelling caps at +26, not +20).</li> <li>With Spell Focus: Abjuration, the Shield spell protects against Isaac's Lesser Missile Storm as well as Magic Missile. With Greater Spell Focus, this protection extends also to Isaac's Greater Missile Storm.</li> </ul><ul><li>Spell Focus Conjuration</li> <li>Each Spell Focus in Conjuration grants a small bonus to the statistics of creatures summoned by the [Lesser/Greater] Planar Binding Spells, and Epic Spell: Dragon Knight.</li> <li>Greater Spell Focus: Conjuration causes a caster to summon a creature one \"level\" higher than normal when using the Summon Creature I-VIII spells, in the same way as the bonus provided by the Cleric's Animal <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Animal_domain%7CAnimal\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Domain</a>. Note that Animal Domain and Greater Spell Focus: Conjuration <em><strong>do not</strong></em> stack in this respect. This feat will also grant <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Warlock#Fiendish_Summons\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fiendish Warlocks</a> an empowered version of their final summon, and allows Summon Creature IX to summon a more powerful Ancient Elemental.</li> </ul>\n Epic Spell Focus: Evocation drastically improves both <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Greater_ruin\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Spell: Greater Ruin</a> and <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Hellball\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Spell: Hellball</a>, to several times their normal effectiveness. Without this focus, their power is equivalent to Vanilla NWN.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, if I left anything out, let me know I wanna make sure its a grand time. Now, I'll likely want Epic Necromancy, but\u00a0 I don't know if another one would be good. (Not good at feats) I'd say Conj and Greater, to increases summon level a bit for powerful summons and solo, and I suppose acid sheathe boost, but evocation might be better since I want him to be... kinda pew pew... thoughts? Am I asking to much here?<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<br/>\n Edit: added additional spell focus changes as they might be important?<br/>\n<br/>\n Edit2: Just realised... spell penetration might be necessary right? Considering spells don't have that good power against saves typically to begin with.</div>"

I don't know, unlike a wizard you can't really learn more spells on the fly (to change them up) although not being limited to spell slots to cast spells is pretty nice as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n . I want to focus on as much necromancy as I can (but for undead foes, having versatility like fireball, etc. Is also an extreme help.) Maybe you can walk me through this? I know it would be a long explanation on your end (maybe), but could you tell the the pros and cons of each choice?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Almost forgot! I think the highest running in might be +3, that's the highest I've seen so far anyway.

So, that would\u00a0 mean I would have +3 more INT than normal. Which is good, but I wonder if that's really the best choice (if we are concerned about eating up feats). Base wise I suspect with gift the INT to be 20. Ability bumps I suppose brings that up to 27, the Great gives 30 (if we take three like you suggest). However, if I can get +9 (from items) and bring it up to 36 (39 with great). Isn't that essentially the same?<br/>\n<br/>\n I suppose I could do without conjuration (although epic for this wouldn't be needed. Maybe I can just use higher level summon scrolls..), and whilst that doesn't give a bolstered Sheathe, it's still powerful on its own, though soloing will depend on how many scrolls I can afford at the time xD. Because Evocation would be needed to make my other spells somewhat effective right? Two epic spells could be Hellball, and Mummy Dust. If we open up the three GRT INT, they can be used for epic penetration. I was accounting on not using GRT INT, but I could be wrong. Thoughts?</div></div>"

That in no way is saying 'Concentration isn't worth it, scrap it' So, I don't really know where.. underestimating a practically mandatory spell caster thing... is implied... but.. maybe I typed something hinting at that? Wouldn't be the first time I suspect.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for DC it sounds like what you're saying is 36 and 40 INT (buffed) is a matter of DC as well as slots (which adding in spell focus and penetration). So, I will concede on the intellect matter. I can understand 1 GRT INT, bringing 27 to 28. But, added INT armor it goes to 37 a buff from 38-40. That's the cap as you say right? Now, I do understand that 3 great intellects as you suggest would bring it to base 30. and then added armor buffs is 39 then 1 buff is always 40-42 intellect.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, if I understand this correctly. If Casting a level 9 spell it would be DC 10+ Spell level 9+ Ability mod Intellect 40 +15 + feats if Epic +6 Epic pen +6 = 46DC I got that right? (Though, I don't understand the spell foci bit) ...Yeah, I'm starting to find out I stink at this xD<br/>\n<br/>\n IMP expertise, I've never used it to be honest, but I can understand it may have to be used. (Unfortunate casting will break it, I tend to forget toggling, but I'll have to get use to it.) But, I understand it. I'll have to get use to it, though if I can help it I'd rather not even get hit. (Hopefully using things like Finger of Death, etc as a last resort type attack.) But, having to rely on buffs was to be expected as a spell caster.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, you're saying to maybe get necromany up to epic. But, no other school would be worth focusing in due to feats correct?<br/>\n<br/>\n I know I may be over thinking things, and such but I ask you to have patience ^^' I ...guess I get off track, but I end up liking to question things and such.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div></div>"

We just needed to tinker with the explanation a bit I guess haha ^^'. We focus on one to get improved DC for the others, multiple focuses (whilst netting +6 for each individual school) would hinder the others pretty badly. I see... by wanting to focus on two specific schools, I was really crippling myself. Not only in feats, but other spell potential. I apologise for not getting it really until now. Truth be told spell mechanics have been getting me. I didn't even know the intellect modifier was taken into account (for DC) until I was doing those figures... and still sorta got it wrong. Always thought it was 10 + spell level + SP + SF. Hence my major focus.<br/>\n<br/>\n But, now that we have figured everything out, and um cleared up the misunderstanding. Since we're only going to focus in necromancy as still planned. ...What's the plan?</div></div>"
