I just figured that someone who knew what they were doing with clerics and druids would come along. Alas not. All I can do, I'm afraid, is say welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm assuming the addition of Monk will involve the WIS boost to AC, given your other choices, as well as some speed, so no armour.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I understand that Dragon builds took quite a hit in a late patch which increased the number of Druid/Shifter levels necessary to qualify for the feat. Kail Pendragon's famously elegant Cleric 25/Druid 14/Monk 1 'Order of Jormungandr' has the requested classes but is no longer legal.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is that build, for reference:<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>\nHere's a dragon build which does not \n25 cleric lvls to counter dispelling and toolset SR (together with SP feats of course), 14 druid lvls as the minimum to get dragon shape and 1 monk lvl for cheese, of course Actually the build started off as a CLC 26/ DR 14 but I couldn't resist the benefits that 1 single monk lvl would bring. Dragon shape at 33rd lvl already, you have to wait till 39th to get all the monk's boni though (that's to max out discipline and tumble, move it down if you feel you need the monk's boni earlier).Domains are what you feel suits you best, I chose trickery for II and travel for haste. \nI guess that's all, I'll let you judge the build:\n<br/><em>PvM playable 1-40, untested PvP</em>\nSTR: 10\nCON: 12\nINT: 14\n\nSkillpoints: 251\nBAB: 25\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 31/31\nStunning Fist: 1/day, DC 41\n<br/><br/>\n01: Druid(1): Expertise, Spell Penetration\n03: Druid(3): Extend Spell\n05: Druid(5)\n07: Druid(7)\n09: Cleric(1): Empower Spell,Domain: Travel, Trickery\n11: Cleric(3)\n13: Cleric(5)\n15: Cleric(7): Knockdown\n17: Cleric(9)\n19: Cleric(11)\n21: Cleric(13): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=24)\n23: Cleric(15)\n25: Cleric(17)\n27: Cleric(19): Great Wisdom III, (WIS=27)\n29: Druid(10)\n31: Druid(12)\n33: Druid(14): Dragon Shape\n35: Cleric(21)\n37: Cleric(23): Armor Skin\n39: Monk(1): Epic Prowess,M:(Cleave,Evasion,IUS, St.F)\n\n<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></details>\n\nTaking Druid to the requisite 18 levels would cut the Cleric levels down to 21, which would make it dispellable and also unable to penetrate toolset SR. Unfortunately!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou coud try inverting the split, and taking Cleric 15/Druid 24/Monk 1 - you get all your Cleric buffs (although they're dispellable), and you're a competent Druid, able to penetrate SR 30 with the penetration feats (wether or not thats enough will depend on where you play), and having a good DC due to high Wisdom. The only thing is I feel like the Druid doesn't synergize that well with the Dragon shape - go figure! - since they don't really use a lot of buffs (that's what the Cleric's for), and you can't cast your damaging/crowd control spells in Dragon form. But this way you might be able put down a Stonehold or Storm of Vengeance and then buff the dragon with your cleric spells, and mop up the defenseless enemies without worrying about being dispelled &gt;:) (unless I'm missing something?)<br/>\n<br/>\nOne build in the archive actually takes this approach, 'the True Dragon Gleam', although its not as optimized as it could be. I'll try my hand at converting Order of Jormundgandr to this split, but I'm gonna warn you I haven't played a Druid at high levels yet, so I might miss some stuff. Hopefully it helps more than misleads!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cleric 15 / Druid 24 / Monk 1</strong><br/>\nHuman, Lawful Neutral<br/>\n<em>PvM playable 1-40, untested PvP</em><br/>\n<br/>\nStr: 10<br/>\nDex: 10<br/>\nCon: 12<br/>\nWis: 18 (32)<br/>\nInt: 14<br/>\nCha: 8<br/>\n<br/>\nHP: 360<br/>\nSkillpoints: 277<br/>\nSaves, (F/W/R): 25/35/16 (vs Spells 34/44/25)<br/>\nBAB: 25<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 26 (melee), 37 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/armour/shield only): 31/31<br/>\nSpellcasting: Druid(9), Cleric(8)<br/>\nStunning Fist: 1/day, DC 41<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Skills</strong><br/>\nConcentration 43(44), Discipline 42(42), Spellcraft 43(45), Tumble 40(40), 109 points left over<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Level Guide</strong><br/>\n01: Druid(1) Expertise, Spell Penetration<br/>\n02: Druid(2)<br/>\n03: Druid(3) Extend Spell<br/>\n04: Druid(4) WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br/>\n05: Druid(5)<br/>\n06: Druid(6) Zen Archery<br/>\n07: Durid(7)<br/>\n08: Druid(8) WIS+1, (WIS=20)<br/>\n09: Cleric(1) Empower Spell {Domain: Travel, Trickery}<br/>\n10: Cleric(2)<br/>\n11: Cleric(3)<br/>\n12: Cleric(4) WIS+1, Greater Spell Penetration, (WIS=21)<br/>\n13: Cleric(5)\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>\n14: Cleric(6)<br/>\n15: Cleric(7) Knockdown<br/>\n16: Cleric(8) WIS+1, (WIS=22)<br/>\n17: Cleric(9)<br/>\n18: Cleric(10) Improved Critical: Unarmed<br/>\n19: Cleric(11)<br/>\n20: Cleric(12) WIS+1, (WIS=23)<br/>\n21: Cleric(13) Great Wisdom I, (WIS=24)<br/>\n22: Cleric(14)<br/>\n23: Cleric(15)<br/>\n24: Druid(9) WIS+1, Great Wisdom II, (WIS=26)<br/>\n25: Druid(10)<br/>\n26: Druid(11)<br/>\n27: Druid(12) Great Wisdom III, (WIS=27)<br/>\n28: Druid(13) WIS+1, (WIS=28)<br/>\n29: Druid(14)<br/>\n30: Druid(15) Great Wisdom IV, (WIS=29)<br/>\n31: Druid(16)<br/>\n32: Druid(17) WIS+1, (WIS=30)<br/>\n33: Druid(18) Dragon Shape<br/>\n34: Druid(19)<br/>\n35: Druid(20)<br/>\n36: Druid(21) WIS+1, Armour Skin, (WIS=31)<br/>\n37: Druid(22)<br/>\n38: Druid(23)<br/>\n39: Monk(1) Epic Prowess<br/>\n40: Druid(24) WIS+1, Epic Spell Penetration, (WIS=32)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Skills Breakdown</strong><br/>\n01: Concentration(4), Spellcraft(3), Save(21),<br/>\n02: Concentration(1), Save(6),<br/>\n03: Concentration(1), Save(6),<br/>\n04: Concentration(1), Save(6),<br/>\n05: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5), Save(1),<br/>\n06: Concentration(1), Save(6),<br/>\n07: Concentration(1), Save(6),<br/>\n08: Concentration(1), Save(6),<br/>\n09: Concentration(1), Save(4),<br/>\n10: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5),<br/>\n11: Concentration(1), Save(4),<br/>\n12: Concentration(1), Save(4),<br/>\n13: Concentration(1), Save(4),<br/>\n14: Concentration(1), Save(4),<br/>\n15: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5),<br/>\n16: Concentration(1), Save(4),<br/>\n17: Concentration(1), Save(4),<br/>\n18: Concentration(1), Save(4),<br/>\n19: Concentration(1), Save(4),<br/>\n20: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5),<br/>\n21: Concentration(1), Save(4),<br/>\n22: Concentration(1), Save(4),<br/>\n23: Concentration(1), Save(4),<br/>\n24: Concentration(1), Save(6),<br/>\n25: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5), Save(1),<br/>\n26: Concentration(1), Save(6),<br/>\n27: Concentration(1), Save(6),<br/>\n28: Concentration(1), Save(6),<br/>\n29: Concentration(1), Save(6),<br/>\n30: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5), Save(1),<br/>\n31: Concentration(1), Save(6),<br/>\n32: Concentration(1), Save(6),<br/>\n33: Concentration(1), Save(6),<br/>\n34: Concentration(1), Save(6),<br/>\n35: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5), Save(6),<br/>\n36: Concentration(1), Save(6)<br/>\n37: Concentration(1), Save(6)<br/>\n38: Concentration(1), Save(6)<br/>\n39: Concentration(1), Discipline(42), Tumble(40)<br/>\n40: Concentration(1), Spelcraft(5)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is an experience penalty of 20% from level 39 to 40.

First of all I will focus on the melee fight and dragon shape so I will dump spell penetration and geater spell penetration also since on my servers its quite easy to get ability bonuses from items I'm thinking about cutting off empower spell but I'm not sure. Zen archery is last thing I dont need so it makes 3-4 feats. First thing will be blind fight the other 2 could be improved expertise and improved knockdown (is it even worth? I mean does it apply to a dragon?).<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have a question. What makes it undispellable?
