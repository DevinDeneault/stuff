This is for solo, if you're in a party, things are different.<br/>\nOne is, it's a bit of a \"win more\" button. If you can SA them, you can very likely beat them.<br/>\nTwo, what method(s) does the build in question use to generate SA's? If your opponent can't fight back, reducing Str isn't as great as it looks on paper.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, emotionally speaking, I love crippling strike, and also, if you're taking many rogue levels, the useful bonus feats run out very quickly, so you might as well take it.<br/>\nAnd a real question, which not even the wiki seems to answer: how long does it last? Same as called shot?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Boy that was tough, the adrenaline was pumping through my blood as I watched the combat-log &amp; stayed on top of him till finally, I took him out &amp; sent him to meet his ancestors... Yes, I do believe that was CS that allowed me to do that &amp; snatch that sweet victory off of him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, is it worth it?<br/>\nAbsolutely.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Robilar is a really iconic boss in WoG, and it makes a very nice pro-crippling strike argument. (The one character I fought him with was a zen archer cleric, so called shot + dc48 implosions took care of him. This was at a time when storm of vengeance was bugged and wouldn't go off.) Robilar is a great example because most likely you won't be able to knock him off his feet.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's kind of like a mini Bigby 5 in a pinch except it also reduces incoming damage. Also, Called Shot lasts only 4 rounds, not 6, and each instance has its own timer, not the entire stack.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It lasts until healed and there's no mention of a save. This set off my power gaming alarms but I never saw builds here that went with it.

It definitely can win a fight. But to compare it with Death attack, at least to me is like comparing KD with Taunt. They are just too different. <br/>\nSo is Assassin still worth it?<br/>\nYou still have Death attack. But only one paralyzation attempt per flurry. That means that characters with ED are as good as immune to the paralyzation. And monks can dodge ranged paralyzation attempts in a similar way.<br/>\nThere are still reasons to choose assassin. You still get Death attacks, even if they are nerfed. It also offers a way to get \"sneak attacks\" without an xp penalty. \u00a0You still have the undispellable Improved invisibility. \u00a0And you have Great dexterity as an epic bonus feat, so you can build with Great dexterity X and achieve 40 dex if you are so inclined.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

A few other changes are highlighted by Valerfor in the \"Need help ASAP with rakaska (sic) form\" thread in this section. Mick had a great thought (I believe) there as well: if you're going to take away an intrinsic Ass feature, replace it with something else, like HiPS.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour second para is bang on. Dev Crit and spells are matters of choice within various builds/classes - casters can opt to take spell x or y; meleers can choose to go down a Dev Crit route or not. But Assassin is a <em>class</em>. Why do people take it? I'm guessing not for the kewl black wardrobe.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
