Not sure if this is a feature or bug because my current game is VERY generous to loots. I didn't think the past version of Nwn was as generous as mine in term of loot drop. I guess I could :<br/>\n1. Buy more potions or equipment<br/>\n2. Save for future chapter because more valuable and expensive equipment are sure to come, right? RIGHT?</div>"
