      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Yo, I recently came up with an idea. An idea that is ideally ideaish that it's just crazy enough to get us all blown up.<br/>\n<br/>\n Recently I was on Arelith.... takin on a lich... and something came to me. Why am I fighting a lich? Why can't I be a lich? (Also kinda freaking out from the voices playing over a bit.)<br/>\n<br/>\n I thought to myself... is a Sorcerer/Bard possible? I mean... they both used Charisma as their main stat. If anything that's some synergy.<br/>\n<br/>\n I figured I'd come here to seek help.<br/>\n<br/>\n Arelith<br/>\n Server Cap 30<br/>\n Weapon of Choice: ...Whistling?<br/>\n Race; Halfing, Elf, Human... (Yeah, go on.. laugh) har har har<br/>\n<br/>\n I couldn't think of a fully eveloped synergy, but I thought about the beginning classes to start off as sorcerer.<br/>\n Reason?<br/>\n The sorcerer gets some perks, however, since I want\u00a0 to attempt the bard (as part of a buffer/singer) thing I dunno how well it would work out. Sorcerers get a perk. Two in fact. I want to use one of them, but I'm not sure which one would 'affect' the bard side of things. So, I'l; post them here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>The Path of the True Flame</strong> can be chosen at character creation by sorcerers. Followers of the Path of the True Flame get unlimited spells per day, but can cast only evocation spells. This limitation includes spells cast from scrolls, wands, and items like potions; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Misc_Changes#Mundane_Items\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mundane items</a>, however, are the exception to the rule. Epic spells must also only be Evocation (this means Greater ruin and Hellball) however they can only be cast once per rest as per normal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Weave Master </strong>can be chosen at character creation by sorcerers. Weave masters get unlimited spells per day, but they trigger a cooldown period whenever they cast a spell above the first circle in which they cannot cast any spell. The Cooldown formula is: (Spell level -1)*6 seconds.Note that while the cooldown is still in effect, Weave Masters may still cast spells from other sources, like wands, scrolls and potions.The cooldown timer is based on the <em>spell slot</em>, and not the actual spell itself. So spells modified with metamagic, except Quicken Spell, will increase the cooldown accordingly. <ul><li>The metamagic Feat \"Quicken Spell\", when used to cast a spell, will reduce the effective level of the spell by 1 when calculating cooldowns.</li> </ul><ul><li>Using Quicken Spell once you have autoquicken will not decrease the cooldown further.</li> </ul><ul><li>Auto Quicken I: Spells of level 2-3 no longer have cooldown.</li> </ul><ul><li>Auto Quicken II: Spells of level 4-6 count as 2 levels lower, for the purpose of cooldown.</li> </ul><ul><li>Auto Quicken III: Spells of level 7-9 count as 3 levels lower, for the purpose of cooldown.</li> </ul> (Empower and Maximize double and triple cooldowns respectively)<br/>\n<br/>\n Do you guys have any ideas? (Whether true flame or Weave mastery is useable is up to debate, as you guys are the experts. But, not running out of spells every 5 seconds does help. (I can ask the Lich that personally)<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

No no no no no. I'm trying to do a Sorcerer and/or bard. Not a Lich o.o. Nor did I say it was a new idea. I'm just trying to figure out a good sort of thing. Who do you think would invite a singing lich? And one that can't stay alive (with a foreign object) for that matter! I can't say I want a bard for just support (Buffs, Song, etc) because everyone else tells me that's the worst possible scenario. (Even though, I wouldn't mind it. Buffing up allies, but probably not much use unless going a melee build) and then the sorcerer.... well ...I'm sorta better with wizards but I thought to try something new! xD<br/>\n<br/>\n Though, I guess something more realistic would be a bard separate or sorcerer separate.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

But, I already took your advice and moved away from a Sorc/Bard. I'll ask again though, maybe you didn't see it. Would a Bard and a Rogue mix well compared to a Sorcerer Bard? Mix as in... give buffs and be helpful as a bard, but ...open lock disarm trap, and other rogue like things. Or am I just needing another approach from a bard thing? If not, am I better off trying a bard/fighter like suggested above? I'm not against the idea of doing buffed up fighter if it means I can still (buff allies) I suppose<br/>\n<br/>\n Edit: To answer your question on the auto<br/>\n<strong>Automatic metamagic:</strong> Epic skill focus (spellcraft) instead of spellcraft ranks.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

And... if somehow this can do a bit of damage to help out I wouldn't mind, but that could be expecting way to much.

Dex or STR, Let's see.. Party buffs. Undispellable Bard Song would be nice, but I don't think it would work that way Cause 24 bard/3fighter/3rogue doesn't give the full benefits of either side. (Save bard) I find it would likely be more DEX than STR because I don't expect him to be a warrior warrior. And dual wielding isn't really how I see this character. Though, I got a good laugh. A Twinblade who carves you up with a nice little tune.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
