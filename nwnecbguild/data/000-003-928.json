These builds and guides have been both very entertaining and helpful!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm going to start my first SoU/HotU run soon, and I'm looking to build a ranged character. I'm leaning towards the druid. I've gathered mostly pure class levels are ideal for the caster classes. Druid seems to have a lot of good spells, but I'm wondering what the best dip options are for maximizing ranged to limit resting too much<br/>\n<br/>\nI've seen Cleric/Fighter x/4 builds for the BAB to get max attacks and Druid/monk varieties for shapeshifting wis bonuses, but haven't seen a straight D/F build. Is d/f x/4 good? or is there not much gained over a pure druid?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also open to ranger options. I like the idea of having a pet tank and healing it with feed pet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting ranged damage dealer builds?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso are there any mods to remove pet or summons exp leeching?<br/>\n<br/>\nApologies if this has all been posted before. Thanks!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Before the pros come to tell you the actual stuff, the best ranged spellcaster is probably a zen archer cleric. Look up Demolition Man in the lvl40 builds for a very good example.<br/>\nThe idea behind it is that Cleric allows you to \"cheat\" a lot when building a character. You can trash Str because Divine Power will set it at 18 if it's lower. You don't need to worry about BAB because of the same reason (DP sets it to max, and does it better than taking full BAB classes). You take zen archery and suddenly your casting stat is your attack stat too! You take a level of Monk, you now have Tumble and your casting and attack stat now adds to your AC! You can start with Str 8 Con 10 Cha 8 Wis 18 Int 14 Dex 14 (or trash Con too and go Dex 12 Int 16 for an extra maxed skill, or the other way around for +1 AC) and do fine. You can take almost all your levels as a Cleric and put every ability increase to Wis, getting very good attack scores and very good DC's on your spells that require a saving throw. Your Spell Resistance spell will give you very high SR because of all the Cleric levels, after a while, only breaches and mord's can get you. You have enough feats to be very good at your weapon of choice (WF, IC, EWF) and get the 3 spell focus feats in the school of your choice. Alternatively, you can forgo the weapon feats and get more metamagic. You'll still be an excellent shooter.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of clerical and druidic spells overlap. You won't be able to play with shapeshifting, but then again, bears, elementals and dragons are not too hot with a bow :) You do have summons, though, to help you out with the early levels, before your buffs start becoming strong.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can fight with DP+DF, then Called Shot (leg) spam, or have fun with your awesome offensive spells (or both).<br/>\n<br/>\nSoU+HotU put you at ~ level 28 at the end, and they're easy, meaning you're pretty much free to experiment.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Oh, and if you decide to try this, read Maximillian Kane's guide to clerics in the appropriate section!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">OK quick update, in case anyone is looking for something similar and stumbles upon this thread. I did not end up trying Sehanine's Finest, simply because the first 15 levels are all cleric and I just played a cleric. I did try a few of the others posted here, and these were my findings.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuick Disclaimer\u00a0 -- I only played these classes up til 15 or at 15<br/>\n<br/>\nMelee druids:<br/>\nthe Green Knight of Ehlonna -- at low levels it just seemed like playing a gimp druid or an ok fighter. Although I did just finish a melee self buffer cleric in the OC, so maybe my melee benchmark is skewed. But the animal companion goes from being pretty good to pretty wimpy. Spell progression is very limited in the lower levels. It plays like a decent fighter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also tried druid/monk x/1 with a couple of variations. If you wait a while and take the monk level at 10 or later and save points for tumble, you can get like +8 ac and an extra attack per round in one fell swoop. It makes your bear form beastly. I think I had like 36-40 strength. This seems like a very optimized way to play a druid. Also not feat starved, feels pretty ok to take metamagic and melee feats within the 15 levels<br/>\n<br/>\nRanged characters:<br/>\nI did a plain jane druid with zen archery and focus on ranged feats. This was actually my favorite. The damage with archery was lower than the melee druid/monk, but it seemed more convenient. I didn't have to self buff as much, because I didn't end up taking as much damage. I could seamlessly switch between casting and sniping casters. It is a little feat starved to make it work, though. Ranged damage sucks until you get zen archery, and still isn't very good until like level 12. Once I had rapid shot, zen archery, improved critical, owl wisdom buff, and haste boots though it was respectable damage in a convenient format. I kinda feel like the dire wolf ends up being a better animal companion because of better scaling AC, and he seems to have better pathing than the bear? The melee druid can tank and use the bear more effectively for better damage though I think. I would like to figure out some way to improve on this build.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also tried the rogue/wizard/AA build that Empyre65 posted above, and it's a beast. The AA arrows + sneak attack is wonderful. Not really any spell casting, but called shot is kinda fun and the utility of the rogue is great with little to no self buffing. I surprised myself when I killed a dragon in like 6 seconds at one point with some lucky crit lol . I did not level this character up to 15, though. I just popped him in at 15 to a testing ground.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis build intrigued me so I rolled up a fighter/wizard/aa at 15 and he felt trash by comparison. The rogue version just seemed so much better. I didn't notice the improved BAB or damage from weapon spec or more AA levels that much on undead/constructs, but the lack of sneak attack was very noticeable on everything else.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">In case anyone stumbles upon this and had similar questions to me, I wanted to follow up. First of all, I want to thank everyone for all the help, the really cool builds, and the Aielund recommendation. I have downloaded it and will probably start that next. <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\nI kinda feel that a lot of the builds on the site are optimized for max level play or for play on persistent worlds, etc. For actually leveling, I included my build that worked out for me to be more optimized and powerful within the HoTU module than the builds posted here that are probably technically more optimized and powerful in general. Also the build I ended up using is probably really simple compared to what is posted here, but it took me a long time to figure out what feats and skills were actually worthwhile in actual gameplay and how to organize it and when to get what, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my goal here is <br/>\n1. Damage dealing spells for AOE, druid has this in spades, <br/>\n2. ranged DPS for flexibly eliminating key targets while pet/henchmen hold the line and <br/>\n3. the flexibility to stomp anything in shapeshift form with a monk level.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to include ranged DPS because I found shapeshifting as a druid was mildly cumbersome, even though it is very effective. My fat bear ass often precluded my pet or henchmen from pathing correctly into melee. Being in melee seems to necessitate more self buffing, which is especially obnoxious before permanent haste. You don't need a lot of defensive buffs when you're not really getting hit. This allowed me to use more slots for blowing things up. Lightning is just cooler. And shooting arrows between casting spells is a quicker transition than shifting and running in to melee.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Notes!<br/>\n<br/>\n</span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Attributes</span></span><br/>\n</strong>I did 13 dex for rapid shot and 13 strength for mighty bows. Act 2 custom bow meant I could often kill single targets from range in 1-2 rounds.<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><br/>\n<br/>\nFeats<br/>\n</span></strong>I structured this build with the cheesy goal of finishing the campaign in dragon form. It feels plenty powerful to level it that way. If I were not going to make it all the way to 30, I would honestly take more longbow stuff like improved critical and epic prowess and spell feats like spell focus evocation instead of the wisdom.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpell penetration as I understand is more level dependent than spell saves. Spell saves are helped by your massive wisdom score, thanks to owl's wisdom. That's why I went for penetrating spell resistance with feats. That said, spell focus: evocation would be an improvement for dealing with the pesky rogues or whoever has reflex saves. I would take this over great wisdom if you don't plan on making it to 30 for dragon. Reflex saves seem more common than spell resistance, but spell resistance seems more annoying when you do encounter it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Monk Level/Skills:<br/>\n</strong></span>I did monk at 12 for immediate gear availability starting HotU. You can move it to 17 for 1 extra point of tumble AC.\u00a0You could also take an extra monk level in your 20's for 2-3 more tumble AC and the arrow defense, but it hardly seems necessary. /shrug<br/>\n<br/>\nI skipped monk in my SoU playthrough and took elf instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nI took lore and search for tedium reduction /slash/ quality of life.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Gear<br/>\n</span></strong>This build is also maximized for the available gear I found in HotU. You can get the monk haste robe, composite longbow, and gauntlets of ogre strength immediately. Otherwise you could take the monk level later at 17 and get another point of tumble AC. The fire berries are also early, and make the dire wolf hit hard enough to not miss the bear dps too much. Monk haste robe merges with shapeshift form. Haste boots and haste weapon do not. Monk haste robe actually leaves you with higher AC than the haste chain mail.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Animal Companion</strong></span><br/>\nI chose the dire wolf for the scaling AC, and he tanks quite well. With magic fang &amp; fire berries, the wolf can solo a lot. I used a mod for henchman/pet management. The bear is also viable, I just found I had to heal him more often and he couldn't tank a whole room as well. Boujee standards, I know. I would rather have the wolf tank a whole room in a doorway while i mow it down with spells from behind than have the bear deal slightly more damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Attributes</strong><br/>\n</span>I did 13 dex for rapid shot and 13 strength for mighty bows. Act 2 custom bow meant I could often kill single targets from range in 1-2 rounds.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Comparison to Other Builds</strong></span><br/>\nWhile I loved the rogue/AA build that Empyre65 posted, this actually felt more powerful and flexible for my play through. I had more immunities, I had much better AoE, and I had the flexibility to tank and melee. The ranged DPS of the druid is not really that much less, especially on sneak/crit immune mobs. If I factor in pet melee, my regular auto attack DPS is comparable to the rogue/AA<br/>\n<br/>\nRogue/AA, ranger, fighter, and cleric/AA have more BAB, so they do get an extra attack over the druid. The buffed druid AB was comparable or higher, however, at some levels depending on gear due to owl's wisdom.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile there is no cross class exp penalty with a human, there is unfortunately a big penalty to exp from using the summons that the druid class is based on using. This seems dumb when the cleric is more powerful in every way, but whatever. It's nice on modules that scale encounters up to your group size, but that does not appear to be the case for OC, SoU, or HotU.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>\nDruid(29), Monk(1), Human\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Abilies\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0STR: 13\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CON: 10\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0INT: 10\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n1\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a001: Druid(1): Extend Spell, Point Blank Shot\n3\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a003: Druid(3): Rapid Shot\n5\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a005: Druid(5)\n7\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a007: Druid(7)\n9\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a009: Druid(9): Empower Spell\n11\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a011: Druid(11)\n13\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a013: Druid(12)\n15\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a015: Druid(14): Spell Penetration\n17\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a017: Druid(16)\n19\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a019: Druid(18)\n21\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a021: Druid(20): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=24)\n23\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a023: Druid(22)\n25\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a025: Druid(24): Great Wisdom III, (WIS=27)\n27\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a027: Druid(26): Great Wisdom IV, (WIS=28)\n29\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a029: Druid(28): Great Wisdom V, (WIS=30)\n31\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n33\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n35\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n37\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n39\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Skillpoints: 165\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +6, Fear: +2\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0AB (max, naked): 20 (melee), 29 (ranged)\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Spell Casting: Druid(9)\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\nSkills by Level\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a001: Concentration(4), Lore(4), Persuade(4), Spellcraft(4), Save(4), \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a003: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(6), \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a005: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(8), \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a007: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(10), \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a009: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(12), \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a011: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(14), \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a013: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(2), \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a015: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(4), \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a017: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(6), \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a019: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(8), \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a021: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(10), \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a023: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(12), \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a025: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(14), \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a027: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(16), \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Dr\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a029: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(18), </details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Thus, we spend a great deal of time pre-level 40 (and not reaching it at all in many cases), which means ongoing playability becomes very important. The builds I tend to favour are all playable throughout pre-epic levels as well as in the rarefied atmosphere of epic, and the best of our builders (and I'm not including me in that, btw!) create characters that are optimized throughout, rather than flowering only at 40.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, of course, we also have forums for level 20 and level 30 builds as well<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
