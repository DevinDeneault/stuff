      "content": "<div>The request is simple: looking for a build out of a Constantine archetype. High Cha. Major talent at turning/binding/banishing ... everything. Healthy focus on magic that can trick or harm, able to hold his own in a fight and take a hit but not a melee powerhouse per se.\u00a0<br/>\nI've thought Bard/Cleric/Monk combo. I've thought Wizard/Monk/Rogue. I've bashed my head against the wall on build options but can't settle on anything I really feel captures it. I don't care about race so much, just that you capture the essence of the Constantine archetype.\u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hello and welcome Omnivert (or Polymath - sorry, I ain't doing both: it would be both conceptually redundant and counter-intuitive. Why would you need advice?)!<br/>\n<br/>\nI confess I've only seen the Constantine film with Keanu, so I'm unlikely to be very helpful, but I do wonder whether Blackguard might be a good idea (pardon the pun) tied with Bard? The potential, but not obligatory, third class might well work with Cleric, but a lot will depend on how you want to play him.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, and welcome again!</div>",

      "content": "<div>I am not very familiar with John Constantine, but from what I have read; a Rogue type class, or more precisely Bard would fit him role play wise.<br/>\nHe would be heavy on social skills like Persuade, Bluff or even Intimidate, and would probably use Taunt a lot in combat situations. <br/>\nAs for game mechanics, Bard has charisma, the skills and both illusion and enchantment spells. Bard also has the song effects that in high levels have great impact on both friend and foe. <br/>\nIf you want more specific spell casting and turning, Cleric has a lot to offer, even though casting is wisdom based. And if you want the most powerful arcane magic, Sorcerer is a charisma based powerhouse.<br/>\nPower wise, I would go very high on the main class I choose, with only minor multi classing for essential feats and skill dumps.<br/>\nAs for hand to hand combat, both Cleric and Bard have what it takes, and are often the core in extremely powerful builds.</div>",
