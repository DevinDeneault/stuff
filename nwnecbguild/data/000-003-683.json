Arkhalia doesnt give anything special at Epic Assassin 8, that I know of.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou would seem to be right on about your Pre Epic Split of Monk 4, Cleric 8, Assassin 8.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason why I did Monk 6/Cleric 8/Ass 6, is thst I wanted Knockdown, Improved Knockdown before, bu the end of pre epic, from Monk lev 6.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I would really like would be able to get all three of 1. Knockdown, improved knocked from Monk lev 6. 2. Divine Power from 7th lev Cleric, 4th levv spells. And HIPS, from 8th lev Assassin, all before, by the end of Pre Epic.<br/>\n<br/>\nALAS, that is not possible. That means that gona have to defer 1 of those 3 things to post epic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would think that knockdown, improved knockdown, and divine power before, by lev 20, would be best.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut maybe HIPS, Divine Power by lev 20 best.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoubt that Knockdown, improved knockdown, Hips, but defering Divine power to post epic, would be best. That probably not best.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo by knocking Monk to Monk 4 pre epic, your basically saying Divine Power, HIPS, best pre epic, and that knockdown, improved knockdown from Monk 6, can wait until post epic.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo about the CBC. If I goto the google play store, download Microsoft Excel onto my smart phone. Then download the CBC from your link that I can then use the CBC to do builds?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your help<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Then downloaded the CBC.<br/>\n<br/>\nKind of tricky for me to figure out how to use. Took me a long time to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt works just barely ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it doesnt seem to let me, do the stat increases every 4 levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo after filling in 20 levels, the stats are still: Str 10 Dex 17 Con 10 Wis 16 Cha 10 on the thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso altho I can share a link to what I did with CBC showing 20 levels of work on the CBC showing Monk 4/Cleric 8/Ass 8, I still cant post what I did in a organized way, without people here clicking on the link to view this. And it will still show the base starting attribute stats, and no modified attribute stats modified every 4 levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if I just use the CBC to help me plan, do the build, it does do that pretty ok, but if I go to post it here, all I can do is either post a shared link, or put the info here, probably in a unorganized way, like in the way above, in how I have poated build info in a inorganized way.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it does help plan, do builds, calculates, figures almost everything out pretty ok<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a test.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the shared link:<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sharing 'CBC284.xlsx' with you from OneDrive - Personal<br/>\nHi,<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the link to the file:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://1drv.ms/x/s!AgoAb77y3xGra8P4oWgovhQ7fCk\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://1drv.ms/x/s!AgoAb77y3xGra8P4oWgovhQ7fCk</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShared from Excel for Android<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://office.com/getexcel\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://office.com/getexcel</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMike<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It has +2 dex as a racial bonus, and has +1 AB / +1 AC / other bonuses from small stature.<br/>\nHowever Elf is stronger than halfling if you are going dex based dual Kama.\u00a0<br/>\nIt is possible to fit ITWF Kama in the build, and with the cleric AB buffs, quite attractive. Human should be considered an option as your build will be feat starved if you go ITWF.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would drop Cha down to 8, increase Int to 14. This increases both skill points and death attack DC a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like Weapon Finesse at level 3. This is an excellent choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would drop Dodge, Expertise, IC: Kama for Two-Weapon Fighting, Ambidexterity and Improved Two-Weapon Fighting if you remain an elf.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI would take Monk 5 and 6 at level 21 and 22 to access improved knockdown.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen Assassin 9 at level 23 for Improved Invisibility.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThen cleric / assassin as you wish. Preferably cleric 12 sooner rather than later, as the cleric buffs are useful, but you may wish for a late spellcraft skill dump.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suggest taking Epic Weapon Focus: Kama at level 21, Epic Prowess, then put the rest into Great Dexterity, aiming for an ending even dexterity score at level 40.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou should have an excellent AB from all the bonus Assassin feats as a result, plus great bonuses to stealth skills which will be important for HiPS (I understand Arkhalia grants Assassin HiPS?)/death attack attempts.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom that point onwards I would want to assess the saves / HP / AB etc of the build and decide further as to what to choose. It might be reasonable to try to enhance some of the other stats it is a matter of balance. At level 40 I would probably want unbuffed HP 300-350 perhaps, and most saves above 20 if possible if I am playing solo, but the targets might adjust depending on the overall balance.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It has +2 dex as a racial bonus, and has +1 AB / +1 AC / other bonuses from small stature.<br/>\nHowever Elf is stronger than halfling if you are going dex based dual Kama.\u00a0<br/>\nIt is possible to fit ITWF Kama in the build, and with the cleric AB buffs, quite attractive. Human should be considered an option as your build will be feat starved if you go ITWF.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would drop Cha down to 8, increase Int to 14. This increases both skill points and death attack DC a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like Weapon Finesse at level 3. This is an excellent choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would drop Dodge, Expertise, IC: Kama for Two-Weapon Fighting, Ambidexterity and Improved Two-Weapon Fighting if you remain an elf.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI would take Monk 5 and 6 at level 21 and 22 to access improved knockdown.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen Assassin 9 at level 23 for Improved Invisibility.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThen cleric / assassin as you wish. Preferably cleric 12 sooner rather than later, as the cleric buffs are useful, but you may wish for a late spellcraft skill dump.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suggest taking Epic Weapon Focus: Kama at level 21, Epic Prowess, then put the rest into Great Dexterity, aiming for an ending even dexterity score at level 40.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou should have an excellent AB from all the bonus Assassin feats as a result, plus great bonuses to stealth skills which will be important for HiPS (I understand Arkhalia grants Assassin HiPS?)/death attack attempts.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom that point onwards I would want to assess the saves / HP / AB etc of the build and decide further as to what to choose. It might be reasonable to try to enhance some of the other stats it is a matter of balance. At level 40 I would probably want unbuffed HP 300-350 perhaps, and most saves above 20 if possible if I am playing solo, but the targets might adjust depending on the overall balance.</div></blockquote>\n\nThanks a lot for the help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it is very helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow did you post the info in the CBC in such a organized way like that?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I clicked the share button on the CBC, all it would let me do is share the link.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt wouldnt share it, post it in the way you posted it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd when I clicked the link, the info didnt look like the way you posted it, and it looked like it was hard to see the info, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have played the build on Arkhalia up to lev 5, so everything you see in the build, up to lev 5, is already permanent, cant be changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can start over tho.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I used the CBC, I noticed that it would only let me take 2 weapon fighting at 1st lev. It wouldnt let me take 2 weapon feat, Improved 2 weapon feat, Ambidextery as last 3 Pre Epic Feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think thats because I chose dodge, instead of 2 weapon fighting at level 1. I think you have to choose 2 weapon feat at 1st lev, or not at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason why I wanted dodge was because I wanted Mobility to help with Attacks of Opportunity. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut now I am thinking that a high tumble, and death attacking and HIPS makes Mobility for AOE(Attacks of Opportunity), a useless feat, which makes Dodge a useless feat.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoing it over again I would.<br/>\n<br/>\nLv 1: 2 weapon fighting feat(but only if have to take it at lv 1, and cant take it later <br/>\n<br/>\nLv 3: weapon finesse<br/>\n<br/>\nLv 6: Weapon Focus Kama<br/>\n<br/>\nLv 9: Ambidexterity<br/>\n<br/>\nLv 12: Extend or Improved 2 weapon fighting<br/>\n<br/>\nLv 15:  Extend or Improved 2 Weapon fighting<br/>\n<br/>\nLv 18: Blind Fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nReason I didnt go with a human, is because without the +2 dex bonus a Elf, Halfling gives, my stats:<br/>\n<br/>\nStr 10, Dex 16, Con 10, Wis 15,16, Int 12, Cha 10<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I take cha down to 8, I not only make turning undead a lot less effective, BUFFS become less effective(based on Cha)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if I do make Cha 8, and go with Int 14, then:<br/>\n<br/>\nStr 10, Dex 16, Con 10, Wis 14,15,16, int 14, cha 8.<br/>\n<br/>\nProblem with that, thats ONLY a 15,16 AC<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a 17 Dex and 16 Wis thats a 16 AC, and I can have a 17 AC by, on lev 4. Thats workable.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a 16 dex, and 14,15,16 Wis, I have a 15 AC, 16 at ultimate best, and I dont get to 18 dex, 16 Wis, a 17 AC until levels 8 to 12 to 16. Thats not even close to optimal, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that rules out a human, unless you can see a way with a humsn to have a 17 dex, 16 wis, while not screwing over other stats, and a cha 8 at worst.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would prefer a human, as I would like the extra feat, skill points, but not seeing it as doable, unless you can show me how.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat would seem to leave Halfling, Elf.<br/>\n<br/>\nProblem with Halfing is halfling cant dual wiield 2 Kama's, also a halfling doesnt get to start out with a longbow, like a Elf does.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do like the halfling bonus to AC tho, so if I could use 2 kamas, and either a light crossbow, or small shortbow(Ranged is really important to survival in the beginning 2,3,4 levels), I would go halfling.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut another problem with halflings, is halfling are not good for knockdown, and improved knockdown. Elves, Humans are better for that then Halflings.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the help.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooks like I should start over again.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving the CBC, and help here, should help me avoid some earlier mistakes.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Because Kamas are small weapons, small characters such as Halflings will have a -2 AB penalty when dual wielding them.\u00a0<br/>\nWhereas an Elf will not have that problem.<br/>\nElf will also find it easier to knockdown opponents for even more sneak attack damage.<br/>\nIf you decide to single wield a Kama (*only* doing up to 8 attacks / round) then Halfling offers a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nA base AB of 42 plus cleric buffs is excellent, and assassin provides the extra AB compared to rogue from its Great Dexterity bonus feats..\u00a0<br/>\nCombined with sneaking/flanking attacks, or attacking knocked down opponents who have their tumble/Dodge/Dex AC destroyed the 'in practice AB' will be even higher.<br/>\nI would drop AB down by 1-2 points if this guy is taken solo to balance the build a little for:<br/>\n- more HP (ie higher starting constitution, toughness feat) -&gt; aim for around 300-350 HP<br/>\n- more fortitude save (ie great fortitude/epic fortitude feats)\u00a0<br/>\n- maybe epic skill focus: Hide and Move Silently given you have HiPS<br/>\nBut in a party this matters less, others can tank or disable enemies for you, and you can do your role which is to kill things rapidly with death/sneak attack 5-10% more effectively with the extra AB.<br/>\n<br/>\nSkillswise I do not know the Arkhalia environment well enough, but usually I would aim UMD 33 modified (for 0% spell failure from scrolls), Tumble 40 (+8AC),\u00a0 and take the points out of discipline to achieve this.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I can do ranged and probably survive until 4th lev, until goto 18 at 4th, then gear, cleric buffs, should get me to 8th lev, where goto Wis 16. Then can go Dex rest of way. That 1 less point of Wis at 15 instead of 16, is worth 2 stats points which can be used to start with a 12 Con, instead of 10 Con.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat alone should net 40 more HP, to 316 HP at 40th lev.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat should be enough. Build is so feat starved, that dont want to spend a feat slot on Toughness.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd also since AB, and AC so high, I either shouldnt be hit, or should be hitting more then being hit, and if I am death attacking, then I should be paralyzing, death attacking, sneak attacking, instead of being hit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd with Evasion, and high Will, Reflex saves, I shouldnt be taking lots of Spell damage, trap damage, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo 316 Hp should be just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as great fortitude feats, I have seen how vulnerable the build is to poison, diseases, etc, that wreck my other attributes, Saves, AC, AB, etc<br/>\n<br/>\nI can sacrifice 1 great dex feat and go with Great Fortitude, that and the +1 Con bonus should give 3, 4 more points to Fort Save and make it about equal at about 25, 26, 27, 28, to my Will save that at 26,27,28<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll go with Elf.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will give up discipline. If I am paralyzing, death attacking opponents, I am probably not being disarmed, and not being knocked down.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can use those 20 points for Hide, UMD, Tumble, Disable Device.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo because of that I dont think I will use Skill focus.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just dont have the room for all your different feat suggestions, because pf how feat starved, and because of how valuable AB, AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso the +3 from Skill focus wont make that much of a difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll go into the CBC, make those changes, and then repost it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your help.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

But even tho that freed up 20 points, there is just barely, borderline not enough skill points to get UMD at 30, Move Silently at 35, Hide at 40, Tumble at 40. I came close to all that, but not quite.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo even tho thats the case not going to use Epic Skill Focus feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nAB at 40, instead of 42 where it was before, not going to dip to 38, 39 AB, just to take the skill focus feats over the Great Dexterity.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso since no skill check penalties for wearing armor, since dont wear armor as a monk/Cleric/Ass, and since have Ghostly Visage, Darkness, invisibility, Improved Invisibility, Combined with 39 Hide, 30 move silently, I shouldnt have any problems going undetected, death attacking. Also I can use gear, and my +11 dex bonus, and a D20 +53(Modified(39(normal), to avoid detection.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttribute Stats:<br/>\n<br/>\nStr 10, Dex 16(32 at 40th lv), Con 12, Wis 16, Int 14, Cha 9(when go from 17 to 16 dex, get 3 points. 2 of those points go to make Con a 12, instead of a 10, but have 1 point left over. Have to put that point somewhere, so put it in Cha, so Cha a 9, instead of a 8 or 10.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the CBC link.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sharing 'CBC284.1.xlsx' with you from OneDrive - Personal<br/>\nHi,<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the link to the file:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://1drv.ms/x/s!AgoAb77y3xGrb23G5l_kvmJg2Lw\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://1drv.ms/x/s!AgoAb77y3xGrb23G5l_kvmJg2Lw</a><br/>\n<br/>\nShared from Excel for Android<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://office.com/getexcel\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://office.com/getexcel</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what I am going to go with.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf there is any further help, suggestions, thats ok<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the help.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
