      "content": "<div>Hello all!<br/>\nBumped here to present one of the builds used in the last month (with great pleasure); some time ago I searched for builds specialized in more than one weapon and more than 10 RDD levels; this was an intriguing concept, as more RDD levels mean more AC than the one provided by bard skill dumps and armor skin feat.<br/>\nTo preserve shield AC in the most difficult moments, the specialization should be obtained both in a 1-hand and a 2-hand weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving found none of them (as specialization in two weapons is taken by either CoT builds - Mick's Brawler is the first one that comes into my mind - or builds with the same class split but with fighter levels &gt;=20), I chose to design it; she has performed well in WoG server, and now she is lv 39: her setting is general, and there have not been customization for that particular environment.<br/>\nAB is 48, and I didn't want to push it further to take many RDD levels pre-epics, and help boost Will save (one of the meelers' Achilles' heel); an high-AB should also help to raise AC (through expertise/improved expertise) without risking a lot of miss attacks; disarm attempts also help to raise AB.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapons chosen are warhammer and halberd to cover all damage types, some alternatives can be:\n<ul>\n<li>Scythe instead of halberd;</li>\n<li>Morningstar and greatsword.</li>\n</ul>\n\nFighter(18), Bard(2), Red Dragon Disciple(20), Half-Orc<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 19 (44)<br/>\nDEX: 9<br/>\nCON: 14 (16)<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 14 (16)<br/>\nCHA: 6

fortitude save boosts instead of will (which is already a modified 20);</li>\n<li>maximize concentration to resist taunts and preserve AC, in spite of listen.</li>\n</ul>\n\nDelightful to hear any

      "content": "<div>Oh, I do like this one, Aquarius! I'll take her out for a run myself, in fact. (Not looked at the second version yet, I'm afraid.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI've only a couple of thoughts - mostly about personal preference. I'd lose Imp Expertise and insert Imp Knockdown. I might also do a little feat juggling and get Luck of Heroes rather than Iron Will. My only other thought is to take EWF in both weapons before taking EWS in both - you've masses of STR damage in any case, so landing hits takes priority for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nVery impressive work!</div>",

She IS Vudash! Half-orcs rule! <span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83d\ude00</span><br/>\nThis is one of the few builds whose KD (at lv 3) landed against casters!<br/>\n<br/>\nok thank you for your comments: so en route to swap will boost saves with great fortitude (or epic fortitude for v2)!<br/>\nImproved expertise has been chosen as her AB is very high, and with a bless/bulls potion (or +5 weapon/STR boost items) the further -5 AB loss (compared to expertise) is compensated; this has performed well also with bosses in WoG (although I think that, for the most powerful ones, this trick won't work as she would have to aim for 19 or 20s to hit).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn less harsh environments I would almost surely choose IKD and considerate your advice, Stag; however, during my playtesting, I found that (with the necessary caution) giants and dragons are wacked before they can be a threat to this build (if I forget to equip in time a belt of minor guiding light or use a clarity potion before approaching the dragon's fear aura, that is my fault).<br/>\n<br/>\nGood point on Luck of Heroes!</div>"
