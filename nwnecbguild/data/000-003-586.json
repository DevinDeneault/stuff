      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hey there, everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope my request is not too specific/frustrating/difficult, but on the recommendation some people from the forum I reached out to privately, they've directed me here.<br/>\n<br/>\nA bit of background on myself. As a kid (between, iirc, 14-17), myself and 6 friends played on an NWN RP server. Some of our fondest gaming memories. And, myself and 2 of these friends have since been giving NWN: EE a spin over the last week, getting back into the game after seeing it had been 're-released'. I also had some experience with Bastions of War, a team-based PvP server. However, it's been about 10-13 years since I last played, and so, my build knowledge is pretty much all gone. On top of this, I'm sure you're all much better equipped to design a build than I was even in my 'peak'!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm quite OCD about my builds in all games (whether it's an RPG like NWN, a pesky low-level invader in Dark Souls, or following the meta in an FPS like CS:GO), and so I thought it'd be great to try to get some help with a build to fit my current needs, from those most knowledgeable. I'm currently following the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/art2/ziranath/kukri.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">classic Kukri Master build</a>\u00a0(shoutout Wayback Machine), and I'm just wondering if I could perhaps get something even more powerful. And, to clarify: I don't want the build to be powerful/'OP' for incessant PvP/power-abuse/at the expense of other players, etc, it's purely because, as previously mentioned, for any game I play, I like my builds to be as good as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are the guidelines below.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Build Guidelines</span></strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Server: Arelith</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>If you don't know the ruleset of the server, you can find all the changes on <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.nwnarelith.com/Main_Page\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">their Wiki</a>. Though, from browsing the forum, I think many of you are aware of the rules, e.g. multiclassing (e.g. must take 3 levels of a new class first), feat changes (no Dev Crit, etc), race changes/sub classes, and so on. Do let me know if you'd like me to try to summarise these myself. It's important for the build to be able to be leveled without needing to apply for certain class/RP/etc privileges.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>PvM or PvP</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>I would primarily like the build to be optimised for PvP, against any type of enemy, preferably multiple (one can dream!), at any time, without requiring lots of self-buffs, and definitely not requiring the help/buffs of others to 'peak'. Be it melee-users, or magic-wielders. In my experience, these types of PvP-focused builds are still relatively viable and strong in PvM. Nonetheless, a good overall build that can approach both arenas would be preferable.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Level Cap</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The level cap is 30. However, a build that can have a smooth 'power curve', and won't be a pain to level, would be great, as it'll make the overall experience more enjoyable, and less grind-y. If any of you are Arelith players, optimal/streamlined-levelling tips would be most appreciated. Please feel free to reach out over DM. Again, to reiterate: I'm an RPer through and through. But, I do at the same time like to be smooth/not held back with my progression.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Race</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Any race is fine. Though, I like the idea of playing a race that has a long lifespan, so I can RP the character for as long as I'd like. I've always been a fan of half-Elves, as I am a mixed raced person in real life myself. But, any race will do for the purpose of build power.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Class Preference</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Here's where things might get a bit frustrating... I like melee. HEH. Yup, and as we all know, at least historically (again, iirc), mages are King/Queen. If the build can primarily be melee-focused, and be completely self-reliant, that would be perfect. However, I do not mind if the build has some self-buffs/magic, to give it that extra, etc. For example, as I mentioned before, I'm currently following the classic Kukri Master build, which uses one CoT buff to be optimal (correct me if I'm wrong). To summarise: I have always loved the RP of a character that is battle-ready at all times. He/she is as good, and ready for battle getting out of bed, as he/she is at any other time... unlike those pesky mages who, in the right circumstance, unprepared and not buffed, would fall with just one or two, well-placed fell swoops. Long story short: melee is my preference, but ultimately I'm open to anything that can give me the strongest all-round build possible, that has a focus on PvP/dueling, as well as being viable in PvM.</li>\n<li>Old builds I use to use that may help give you context, in RP or Arena (but, these were all level 40): Fighter/WM, Ranger/Rogue/SD, Fighter/Bard/PM (I recall this one being super-strong vs. everything).</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Melee Preference</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>I love to dual-wield, and crit big - perhaps hence why I'm using the Kukri Master build now. The combat chain\u00a0 of these types of builds are often very satisfying to me. I used to also love Knockdown builds, but I'm quite certain the feat is heavily nerfed (vs. other players) on Arelith. Dev Crit is also disabled on Arelith. Ultimately, I'm happy to form my RP around whatever melee style would be most optimal.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Range Preference</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>I tend not to play ranged. However, if it could somehow benefit my build overall, I'm open to it. And, in which case, Bows would be my preference.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Weapon Preference</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>As you might be able to tell: high crit range. My history is one mainly of Kukris, and Rapiers. However, again, I'm happy to go with whatever melee weapon would be most optimal.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Maximum Item Enhancement</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Correct me if I'm wrong, and I imagine some of you may know better than I, but, through my research, I think the best crafted items on Arelith come with +3. E.g. The best crafted Kukris (and I could be wrong), come out with +3 AB, and armour, with +3 AC.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Spellcasting</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>I would prefer to avoid this, bar a few self-buffs, but I am open to whatever is most optimal.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Custom Factors</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Arelith's Wiki has a full description of their custom factors, and I'm sure many of you guys are aware of them. As I said before, I can try to list the important ones, if you need, or you can check their Wiki.</li>\n</ul>\n\nAnd that's all. I hope I've followed the 'build request guidelines' appropriately, but just let me know if you need more information. Whether that be about the server, my preferences, or anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nUltimately, I'm looking for the across-the-board strongest build, preferably melee-based, with a level cap of 30, that fits within the Arelith ruleset, and is fun to play. I want you to feel like you have free reign to make whatever you'd like. Perhaps the Kukri Master is the best fit, and I'll continue that character's journey, but hey, maybe you have something spicier.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, it's just great to be playing the game again, and with 2 of my childhood friends. We seem to be recapturing some long-gone part of our childhood that once gave us so much enjoyment. A big shoutout to all of you for sticking by the game for so long, and also for helping out people like myself. It's really appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the best,<br/>\n<br/>\n-P<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The level spread is Fighter 6/ Weapon Master 14/ Champion of Torm 10. Dev crit is out, so it is up to you if you still want to use O Crit feat but because \"Divine Weapon Master\" is based on dev crit, I will leave it there in the build but you can change it for other feat depending on your purposes/playstyle. Combat style is sword and shield because many feats investment for WM and O crit requirement plus dual-weapon feats will cripple the build.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe model uses the WM heavy approach because the divine wrath buff required more investment in CHA and even if you reached STR 23 (O crit requirement) and then pump the rest to CHA, your final CHA will be at best 17 (assuming your starting stats are STR 15/ DEX 14/ CON 12/ WIS 8/ INT 14/ CHA 14). Wearing CHA enhanced equipment will give you 17 + 12 = 29 or 9 rounds of divine wrath (I don't know if there is a cap to maximum stat bonus in Arelith, so I just assumed the enhanced stats cap is the same in vanilla) which may not be long enough (depending on the battle situation, like if you fight a tough enemy or boss) and it can only be used 1x per day.<br/>\n\u00a0 <br/>\n*Note : Thanks to Stagmeister for the info on mandatory consecutive 3 levels upon taking new class<br/>\n<br/>\nTitle : Divine Weapon Master \"WM Heavy Arelith\" (F 6/ WM 14/ CoT 10)<br/>\nRace : Human<br/>\nAlignment: Any Non-evil<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 15 (26)<br/>\nDEX: 14<br/>\nCON: 14<br/>\nWIS: 12<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Fighter(1): Weapon Proficiency Exotic, Dodge, Weapon Focus: Katana<br/>\n02: Fighter(2): Expertise<br/>\n03: Fighter(3): Mobility<br/>\n04: Fighter(4): STR+1, Weapon Specialization: Katana, (STR=16)<br/>\n05: Fighter(5)<br/>\n06: Fighter(6): Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack<br/>\n07: Weapon Master(1): Weapon of Choice: Katana<br/>\n08: Weapon Master(2): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n09: Weapon Master(3): Power Attack<br/>\n10: Champion of Torm(1)<br/>\n11: Champion of Torm(2): Blind Fight<br/>\n12: Champion of Torm(3): STR+1, Cleave, {Smite Evil}, (STR=18)<br/>\n13: Weapon Master(4)<br/>\n14: Weapon Master(5)<br/>\n15: Weapon Master(6): Knockdown<br/>\n16: Weapon Master(7): STR+1, (STR=19)<br/>\n17: Champion of Torm(4): Improved Critical: Katana<br/>\n18: Champion of Torm(5): Great Cleave<br/>\n19: Weapon Master(8)<br/>\n20: Weapon Master(9): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n21: Champion of Torm(6): Great Strength I, Epic Weapon Focus: Katana, (STR=21)<br/>\n22: Champion of Torm(7)<br/>\n23: Champion of Torm(8): Epic Weapon Specialization: Katana<br/>\n24: Champion of Torm(9): STR+1, Great Strength II, (STR=23)<br/>\n25: Champion of Torm(10): Overwhelming Critical: Katana<br/>\n26: Weapon Master(10)<br/>\n27: Weapon Master(11): Great Strength III, (STR=24)<br/>\n28: Weapon Master(12): STR+1, (STR=25)<br/>\n29: Weapon Master(13): Armor Skin<br/>\n30: Weapon Master(14): Great Strength IV, (STR=26)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 360<br/>\nSkillpoints: 165<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 24/17/24<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +3<br/>\nBAB: 25<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 38 (melee), 27 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane items only): 17/27<br/>\nSpell Casting: <br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscipline 33(41), Intimidate 4(3), Listen 33(34), Persuade 1(0), Spellcraft 13(15), Spot 33(34), Tumble 15(17)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Discipline(4), Intimidate(2), Persuade(1), Spellcraft(2), Tumble(2), Save(2), <br/>\n02: Discipline(1), Save(6), <br/>\n03: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(4), <br/>\n04: Discipline(1), Save(8), <br/>\n05: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(6), <br/>\n06: Save(11), <br/>\n07: Listen(10), Spellcraft(1), Spot(2), Tumble(1), <br/>\n08: Discipline(2), Spot(3), <br/>\n09: Discipline(1), Listen(2), Spot(1), Save(1), <br/>\n10: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(1), <br/>\n11: Discipline(1), Spot(3), Save(2), <br/>\n12: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), Save(3), <br/>\n13: Discipline(1), Listen(4), Spot(3), <br/>\n14: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Spot(2), <br/>\n15: Discipline(1), Listen(2), Spot(1), Save(1), <br/>\n16: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), Save(1), <br/>\n17: Discipline(2), Spot(1), Save(3), <br/>\n18: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), Save(2), <br/>\n19: Discipline(1), Listen(2), Spot(3), Save(1), <br/>\n20: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), <br/>\n21: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(3), <br/>\n22: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(3), <br/>\n23: Discipline(1), Spot(2), Save(5), <br/>\n24: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(5), <br/>\n25: Discipline(1), Spot(2), Save(7), <br/>\n26: Discipline(1), Listen(7), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), <br/>\n27: Discipline(1), Save(4), <br/>\n28: Discipline(1), Listen(3), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(1), <br/>\n29: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(4), <br/>\n30: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spot(5), Tumble(1),<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Me again. I've been looking a bit further into Arelith, and a few things that might be pertinent to this build have cropped up.<br/>\n<br/>\nFighter 5 attracts an automatic +1 Armour AC bonus. Fighter also receives +1 to Discipline every 3 levels of the class.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is the Gift system at character creation, whereby, as a human, you can take up to 2 Major Gifts (such as two starting stat increases of +2) and 1 Minor Gift (such as 5% elemental damage immunity). However, this will impact on your Effective Character Level (ECL), and the higher your ECL the lower the xp you gain for killing things, so making levelling harder. You can take none, one, two, or the whole lot, but you'll be spending longer at the same level the more you take.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm getting the impression that Craft Weapon and Craft Armour might be quite important skills to have.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe katana is redesignated as a small weapon, now weighing 6lbs. It is therefore finessable and useable by smaller races in D-W. Its damage and threat remained unchanged (1d10 and 19-20x2 respectively - same as bastard sword).<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know whether any of this might impact on your build, <em>@NobleSky</em>, but thought I'd best point them out.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I would also swap the Wisdom and Charisma scores since Divine Might (which Arelith uses a cooldown for) scales off Charisma and nothing in that build scales off Wisdom.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will also likely want to fit in Improved Expertise and Knockdown has been changed vastly decreasing its power. It is now well worth considering Improved Knockdown vs Improved Disarm vs Called Shot (leg) plus another feat like Improved Expertise.
