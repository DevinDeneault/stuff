moreover, I sacrificed 1 AB, replacing the last two great strenghts with epic fortitude and epic will;</li>\n<li>As CoT grants bonus feats, I took the \"two weapon-mastering\" road, deciding for two types of damage and combining offense (heavy flail) with defense (bastard sword + shield) approaches;</li>\n<li>I am a bit worried for the low amount of hit points, provided that this character is a meeler; is there some room for raising them (initial stats? toughness? epic toughness?)</li>\n<li>I have given precedence to other feats as to the weapon focus, because the STR modifier compensates the +1 bonus. I think that I can wait to use the bastard sword, as I can temporary use other martial weapons. I would not maximize the ability with scimitar, as I don't consider it as a paladin weapon (although I know that the heavy flail may not be common among paladins).</li>\n<li>Would a paladin 26/CoT 14 provide better results? I would like to keep the undispellability of the paladin spells, so 24 levels of paladin should be the minimum acceptable threshold.</li>\n<li>Would you prefer to take early undispellable paladin spells, or early buff to saves? Saves are better, but with half-orc characters I would be convinced that the best defense is a good offense...</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\nLet me know of what you think! Thanks for your contributions!</div>"

Change the build to Paladin 26/ Fighter 4/ CoT 10, this will bring you more dakka &amp; more feats &amp; it is completely in theme for the character. Focus on a single weapon &amp; take save boosters pre-epic &amp; toughness to boost your hit points a little. Keep taunt &amp; see if you can squeeze devastating critical in there.

      "content": "<div>Thank you for your input, Valerfor!<br/>\nI am happy with your advice to stay away, on epic levels, from save booster feats; as you can see below, I have introduced \"great fortitude\", \"iron will\" and \"luck of heroes\", and they can greatly compensate the loss of epic feats. However, I am a bit concerned about the XP penalty: I have tried to modify the level progression to delay this penalty as far as I could, however taking all the CoT feats pre-epic would only have led to less epic feats.<br/>\nBy taking toughness pre-epic I can obtain more 40 HP, however (mainly due to EWS: Heavy Flail) I have not got anymore room for epic toughness.<br/>\nAs I will play Aielund with him, I can't do devastating criticals....which would be the feats to sacrifice for gret cleave, overwhelming critical, and devastating critical?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that, in a more defensive approach, I can replace \"luck of heroes\" with \"Exotic weapon proficiency\" and wield a bastard sword and shield.<br/>\nBy the way, I have seen, on the vault, that a single-player version of the \"World of Greyhawk\" server; as you have played in this persistent world, which changes do you suggest for this build?

      "content": "<div>Hi there, Aquarius!<br/>\n<br/>\nI can't really help much with build specifics, but I know Aielund well enough to know that there ain't no particulary worthwhile heavy flails (I tried one such build myself and got very cross). If you want 2-handed then Greatsword or Greataxe (though that won't come in much 'til later) is the way to go. If not, Bastard is an excellent option (I'm assuming you won't be too bothered about taking melee-based henchies with you), although so is Katana. Obviously, both require exotic weapon proficiency. I grant that you lose bludgeoning damage, but there aren't many times that would come into play, so you should be ok. Actually, thinking about it, katana makes a lot of sense, 'cause towards the end-game you're kind of stuck with a bs-wielder, and that could get awkward. Speaking for myself, I'd drop Luck of Heroes unless I was going Greatsword/axe - your saves are fine anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour CON might be an issue, though (and given that Aielund will end around level 36-37 you won't get that extra 40hp from Epic Toughness). So it's either buff like a bastard or find some other way to get that AC mah-ussive - the principle being: if you get hit you die, so don't get hit.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, a few thoughts, for what they're worth. Oh, and either happy birthday for recently or within the next few days!</div>",

      "content": "<div>The island of Ruskis is a nice little fluff adventure but it is hard and confusing at times with little rewards for your efforts, avoid it as a new player. A plain fighter is fine for WoG but you have to be a good player (and I think that you are) and know the place (which you don't at the moment). A much safer bet would be a (ftr/bard/rdd) with bastard sword &amp; shield that also has devastating critical until you learn the server better at least, or a pale master warrior (fighter/bard/pm). Those are both powerhouses and will diminish the module's difficulty greatly but when you are a greenhorn you need every advantage that you can get. Your later build is solid though and you could do great with it as well (and I understand that you like dwarven defenders) provided that you select your equipment well. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe temple of elemental evil is a gem of an adventure, old-style huge dungeons with lots of secrets and some (very) nasty surprises, incredibly good rewards and spooky atmosphere, is the go-to place for ninety percent of the new players in WoG. If you prefer a more sandbox environment though with classic dnd experience then you will head down to\u00a0 Borderkeep where a war against the Orc &amp; Goblinoids is going on, more lethal and lesser rewards overall than ToEE though, so keep that in mind. And then, there is the Undermountain...<br/>\n<br/>\nSome overall tips for WoG, always have ready in a quick-slot, a different weapon than the one you currently wield, the target does not take much damage from your sword? Try a hammer instead. Always take some ranks at least in search, cross-class if need be. Always keep stock in aid/bless/invisibility &amp; clarity potions and use them when needed. Also, every melee warrior without umd should search for dust of disappearance (50% concealment) and use them for the tough fights, they are expensive but totally worth it. Go to the city of greyhawkand search the stores &amp; the temples, not all carry the same items. Lastly, become a devotee of your god in his temple, a special store will open up that allows you to purchase some better equipment. Oh, and put map-pins everywhere so that you remember where is what on these huge maps.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Eheh you are right! ;)<br/>\nJust one more question, and I'll stop going off-topic: how can I be a devotee of a god? I have seen, in some temples, that I can ask to be a devotee, but they always replied to me that I couldn't be a devotee. I guess that it is due to a different alignment (dwarven defender: LG), but I haven't written a deity while creating my character. <br/>\nSo, is it possible to assign a deity to my character, without having to replay from scratch?<br/>\nOr do I have only to go to a temple of a LG god? If so, I'm tempted to wait for dwarven gods because maybe they have exclusive goods for dwarves...</div>"

However, I beated Zuggymot because of a bug: after tons of reloads, the first form (Old Crone) appeared and started spraying acid to the second form of Zuggy: how weird ! :D<br/>\nHowever, I've started thinking that this build is weak for this server: with a level 18 (almost 19) PC, I got through the frost giant's lair, and wasted many heal potions due to the \"Harm\" spell used by giant clerics and to the chief of the frost giants (unbeatable).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs going solo with this dwarven defender (although I'm having fun) is very difficult (nearly impossibile with the big bad bosses) I'm wondering if I have to restart all again, this time with another build that has UMD and tumble as class skills and maybe some casting, either:<br/>\n\u00a0- Cleric 29/Fighter 6/Rogue 5 Human<br/>\n\u00a0- Bard 26/Fighter 4/RDD 10 Human<br/>\n\u00a0- Fighter 26/Bard 4/RDD 10 Human</div>"

      "content": "<div>There is another temple with higher quality gear as well but it's north of critwall, dangerous to get there i'll admit. Your build (presuming it is a corrected version of the hearth guard) is fine, all you need is to know the different routes &amp; quests and be prepared for them. I am assuming you do have an AC of 40 or more (without the stance) and an elemental resistance ring...You can get all these before you go to the frost giants if you search hard enough. There are many quests in Greyhawk city alone, talk to the temples, search the Inns, enter the sewers, leave no stone unturned and you will find many great little things, they add up. Another great point to search is the crossroads, get right &amp; left, deep as you can, see what you can find in there. It would also be better for you to do hill giants first next time before you go to frost ones, and yes I know they are hard to find but once you know, then you will be prepared for all the rest of your characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nWoG bosses are hard because they are meant to be a meaningful challenge for a whole party of characters and not for a solo player, unlike normal modules where the creator presumes a single powerful hero completing all the quests. In addition, WoG has pretty much it's own version of Tony's A.I build-in the module by default, so your opponents will be very intelligent by default, using every little trick they have up their sleeves. Being able to resist knockdown is crucial for a melee character unless he has an AC that is virtually untouchable for his level or kills his opponents really fast. Dwarven defender's ability to soak up damage like nobody's else business is also very good and comes in their own in early epic levels when you start to take your first EDR feats, combine this with an appropriate greater (type of) belt and a ring of elemental resistance and (assuming that you also have dev-critical yourself) you will become an indestructible instrument of wrath for your opponents. <br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, take some of the expensive \"blue\" heal potions from the temples, those act exactly like a healing kit, so when you are fighting a boss and you want to heal yourself in the middle of the fight, they won't get you an attack of opportunity when you drink next to them, many bold adventurers have ended their careers prematurely because of that reason (it is considered rude to drink alone in front of your opponent).<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck &amp; fortune favours the bold as they say!</div>"
