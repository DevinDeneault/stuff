So, I think, lvl 20 build needed here. Most items on server are with +2 bonus, but +3 items could be found too. And, finally, there is one bad bad thing - no skilldumps since level 4. So, when levelup comes, I could only save 2 skillpoints for next level. So, a little bit tough challenge, maybe.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started with the most simple builds I can do for this.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst

You have posted lots and lots in the past.  Something seems amiss about that, no?  Anyway...<br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>D'Alessandro wrote:</strong><br/>\nNow I'm play on russian roleplay server, there is no level cap, but most tough players are around 10-15 level and few arounl lvl 20. So, I think, lvl 20 build needed here. \n</div></blockquote>\nAre you planning on pure party play or PvP as well?  It makes a HUGE difference.\n<blockquote><div>\nMost items on server are with +2 bonus, but +3 items could be found too. \n</div></blockquote>\nRelatively low magic, then.  Battle clerics, melee mages, arcane archers &amp; shifters will generally rule there.  But if you are aware of any nerfs, whether it be to class, race or spells, please reveal them now before any of us make a recommendation that will set you on a path with a server-specific roadblock. \n<blockquote><div>\nAnd, finally, there is one bad bad thing - no skilldumps since level 4. So, when levelup comes, I could only save 2 skillpoints for next level. So, a little bit tough challenge, maybe.</div></blockquote>\nAll that means is that you cannot exploit dumps.  Therefore, you need to recalibrate your thinking to coincide with more traditional  D&amp;D build strategy and take regular levels of those skilled classes and allocate at that time.  This means that a skilled build, especially a magic-focused one, will suffer from lower DCs and/or lower BAB/AB or APR when you are forced to take more levels of a secondary (or tertiary) class than you would otherwise be able to exploit with dumps. So, for example, you may need 4 or more levels of monk (or rogue or bard) instead of 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... holding the decision on how to optimize any build for 20 levels for a moment... you would be best served to decide EXACTLY what you want your toon to achieve.  An excellent support member, a serious tank, an artillery damage dealer who depends on others tanking... what would you most prefer?  Please choose one and let's focus on that before considering options.  Generally-speaking, cleric class builds are the \"one-size-fits-all\" solutions, but they can be boring to play for people who play them all the time and will lose to mages consistently in PvP.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Therefore, you need to recalibrate your thinking to coincide with more traditional  D&amp;D build strategy and take regular levels of those skilled classes and allocate at that time.

So, for example, you may need 4 or more levels of monk (or rogue or bard) instead of 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo... holding the decision on how to optimize any build for 20 levels for a moment... you would be best served to decide EXACTLY what you want your toon to achieve.  An excellent support member, a serious tank, an artillery damage dealer who depends on others tanking... what would you most prefer?  Please choose one and let's focus on that before considering options.

So, as you can see, these bonuses are more effective if applied to the Monk custom attack schedule with a Kama, which, with Haste and Flurry of Blows mode on, can reach 8 attacks per round (10 if you have Two-weapon fighting feats), as opposed to your cleric's 5. You will do more damage per hit, but the Cleric / Monk will certainly do more damage per round unless you fight fire immune monsters all the time.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

On any random low-magic server like the one D'Alessandro describes a DEX cleric is the best way to explore the unknown.  Clerics just have too many buffs to let HP, AB or AC become an issue.  With a DEX focus, your cleric will fill in the only glaring cleric-specific weakness there is... reflex.  Clerics are just about god-awful making their reflex saves even with full buffs active.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe low-magic domain choice is also very easy.  Travel #1.   Trickery #2.  If you have access to permahaste and/or items that confer 50% conceal, then the choice becomes wide open.  I prefer Strength myself, especially when WIS will be relatively low (WIS 18=few slots), like in this case plus the DR of Stoneskin.  War would probably be the next choice in line but environment-specific factors can bias that choice as well.  Essentially, I would examine what works there for others and adjust accordingly.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, in the Blood 'n Faith mini-simulation... I would start WIS &amp; DEX at 16, settle for Level 8 slots and bump DEX-WIS-DEX-WIS-DEX.  If you feel you need over 100 skillpoints, then you will need to balance the importance of CON vs. STR, which, for a DP cleric should not be a tough decision.  The key skills should be tumble &amp; spellcraft.  A dexer's Discipline will be extremely ineffective in a low-magic setting.  Concentration will only enter the picture while casting in combat, a situation which should become easily manageable with Sanctuary/Etherealness available if you need to rebuff or cast offensive. <br/>\n<br/>\nComparatively, a pure caster I would build around a chief spell or 2 (like Implosion and/or Harm) and focus on WIS completely... if that is your preference.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Much better indeed, but not yet according to my taste, let me give you a few more pointers:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Start out with Monk at level 1, you'll get more skill points that way. It will be a PAIN IN THE $%$ to reach level 2 alone, so only do this if you have someone that can help you level up that first level, after that just use summoned creatures and you will be allright for the first few levels. If you have to solo, Take the first Monk level at level 2.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Drop your Strength to 8, and up you Intelligence to 14 for even more skill points. The extra skill points attained this way can go to Spellcraft, together with the INT increase you will be reaching a total of 25 (+1 to saves vs spells), Lore if you must (although I'd consider dropping it), and you can add either Listen or Spot to deal with hidden creatures if True Seeing is nerfed or some cross-class trap skills and ONE point in open locks. For the correct allocation of trap skillpoints, ask Hip, as he is the expert.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Drop Knockdown for Blind Fight to deal with concealed foes, and even consider taking it earlier, leaving Weapon Focus for later, as Clerics don't need AB. A Cleric / Monk will often kill things too fast for Knockdown to be of any use, and at least where I play, the tougher mobs you'd want to KD either have a very good Discipline score or are immune to it, except for very few mages. <br/>\n<br/>\n- Don't go Dex - Wis - Dex - Wis on your stat increases, it's impractical, just get the WIs up as fast as you can, then start investing in Dex. The Wisdom score will give you extra spells per day, and early on is when you need them the most.<br/>\n<br/>\n- If Haste items are available, then swap the Travel domain for Plant, as it will give you access to Barkskin, which is a very good spell to have in a low magic server. If Improved Invisibility items are available (like Dusts of Disappearance), consider swapping Trickery War. War will give you Cat's Grace and Aura of Vitality (which can be extended at level 8). Those two spells will be EXCELLENT to buff your DEX. <br/>\n<br/>\n- Read my guide, not only does it discuss Cleric features extensively, but also gives you many playstyle tips. Read the entire topic, not just the main post, because the Cleric / Monk combo is discussed in the middle of the topic.

Why do you end up with 20 Tumble in your build stats? Do you know what skill dumps are?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this is true, then go Cleric 19 Monk 1, as you won't be able to get the Tumble updates at levels 7, 12 and 17, migh as well start out with Cleric 3 Monk 1 at level 4 and forget about tumble and pretty much anything else. You lose 1 BAB and the slight movespeed bonus for level 9 spells. You'd also have to end at Wis 19 and Dex 18.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, If skill dumps aren't allowed, you could even go Halfling or Elf for an extra 2 DEX points (and +1 size modifier to AB in case of Halfling) at the cost of XP penalty and a few not needed skill points.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>I will met VERY rarely with those hidden/concealed opponents, and only in my late levels, so, maybe, it's not so important for this build<br/>\n</div></blockquote>\n\nNot really, because magic users that have Improved Invisibility will be using it and gaining Concealment bonus.

Haste potions have a VERY SHORT DURATION, so you can stick with travel, but if you can find enough Dusts of Disappearance, I would advise you to invest in the War domain to be able to buff your Dex score. Cat's Grace gives you a long lasting 1d4+1 bonus to Dex, while Aura of Vitality can be cast extended and give you +4 while it lasts.

Does this statement...\n<blockquote><div>\nAnd, finally, there is one bad bad thing - no skilldumps since level 4.</div></blockquote>  mean that 1) you cannot dump all the skillpoints you've saved up to that point AFTER level 4 or that 2) you cannot multiclass until level 4.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf case 1), I'd get that tumble AC as soon as possible, at either level 2 or 3.  Why?  Because this is not going to be a skilled build and that +1AC means a lot in early levels before Magic Vest is available.  Actually, level 3 is probably the best point because the 2 preceding cleric levels will assure your first BAB is active, which is usually important against low-level creatures. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe complimentary skills (like Lore) will add nothing to the build beyond roleplay.  A monk is guaranteed to have the 5 skill points it needs for 5 ranks in tumble for that level which is the only skill worth mentioning, build-wise that is.  Spellcraft will be easier since there will be plenty of cleric levels to bump it up even though it only gets 3 points per level with Int 12.  That means, every 3 cleric levels will guarantee +1 saves vs. spells.  Should be no biggie unless you were preferring more roleplay value (like IDing loot for party folk, passing persuade checks in convos or succeeding search checks so you can cast Find Traps (BTW, on this Russian server, how does Find Traps work?)<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, this tactic will result in less skill points, but a player needs to decide EXACTLY how important the secondary skills are to the overall build per this server vs. combat effectiveness, a subject I have debated with Max on many occasions. For instance, in some SP modules, Persuade is crucial, so that would determine the INT level needed and, consequently, the starting split.  You need to decide that much yourself.   Note:  only Listen is an available class skill in this build so Spot would need to be cross-classed  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother question about the server:  Are there the typical monk gear like robes &amp; boots available by shops or drops?<br/>\n<br/>\nBlind Fight is usually a staple on most environments.  This includes those pesky shadows and any mage or bard that buffs with Ghostly Visage or Imp Invisibility, to mention two.  If your server doesn't utilize those creatures or AI buffs by level 10 or so, it is probably one of the easier servers to level on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO, the only practical use for pushing level 9 slots is for access to Implosion.  Without Evocation foci especially against high-CON monsters, it is an ineffective spell.  Add in the spell resistance factors and success can be problematic... the higher the magic, the less effective it becomes.  Except for adequate Will saves from Owl buffs, that extra point (to WIS 19) will provide nothing.  A fact which should also bias your domain choice towards one that includes Cat's Grace to further buff AB and reflex saves.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to take issue with one of Max's comments to further confuse the issue...  \n<blockquote><div>- Don't go Dex - Wis - Dex - Wis on your stat increases, it's impractical, just get the WIs up as fast as you can, then start investing in Dex. The Wisdom score will give you extra spells per day, and early on is when you need them the most.</div></blockquote>\nChoice: An extra spell level 4 slot (not slots, Max!) and +1 WIS AC vs. a sorely-deficient AB &amp; reflex saves in early toon levels.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIMO the first 2 DEX are the most important and would even consider DEX-DEX-WIS-WIS-DEX since the WIS 17 bump isn't needed until level 16.  Player choice.   By level 8 there should have been 2 monk levels, one at 2 or 3 and another at level 7.  That means BAB is 5, 4 (cleric 6) + 1 (monk 2) at that level.  More important than slots by this level is spell duration of the short buffs.  Later on, when slot management is needed more, like around level 16 (cleric 13, slot level 7)/monk 3) WIS 18 will be there.  Once Magic Vest slots become available at cleric 5-6, AC should no longer be an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main problem I see, is that if the finale of the build is not intended to be used all that much or even perhaps not even attainable, then the offensive capabilities is a moot point and self-buffing, especially their durations is the most key.  In that case, I would discard the last 2 levels in consideration and make sure to get the last 5 tumble ranks in at level 17.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to revisit, monk levels should be taken at 2 or 3, 7, 12 &amp; 17 for full playability and graduated potential...

I NEVER consider available equipment beyond the general magic environment.  But in the example you've posed, it still doesn't matter.  Going from WIS 16 to WIS 18 still nets a single level 4 spell and 1 WIS AC.  The rest of those extra spells and WIS AC that you are getting from equipment you would still be getting regardless of how high the enhancements are and how many items you find or buy, up to the standard +6 modifier boost cap, that is.  I deal only in certainties when it comes to recommendations and let the player make adjustments according to what they encounter during gameplay.  For instance, if the Russians throw this toon a curve and shadows start popping out of the darkness before he gets Blind Fight, he will realize it should have been made a priority.  But who knows what lurks until at least a brief dive into the pool.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, I melee early on.  Usually I use the skels because they can't be critted and Stone Bones makes them tough enough to stand up to low-level mobs.  But seeing as how I am a confirmed XP hog, I always try to plan it that the summon suffers a timely death just before the enemy succumbs so that my toon gets the final kill.      Used to apply the same technique using playmates instead of summons, but it was frowned upon so now I am a kindler, gentler party mate.    j/k<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, except for the skill control business, I think I built almost an identical toon with similar level range for a low-magic server years ago but it was a dwarf (dwarfs had much kewler hang-outs than the humans did.  )  My most memorable gaming experiences were on low-magic servers.  It just seems more like PnP that way.  Usually, it is easier and more fun to party at least in the beginning so one can keep pace with some friends B4 becoming a soldier of fortune.<br/>\n<br/>\nI missed that starting at Level 4 business.  That's why it is so important to get several points of view on the ECB.  We can all translate for each other!<br/>\n<br/>\n@OP: I think you have a decent design there now, D'Alessandro. All it takes is some experimenting and away you go (BTW, <strong>do you test these builds out in a trainer first before vesting hours on a server?</strong>  That was always my standard procedure to reveal any aspects I may have overlooked).

The late rogue dump to UMD per clc16/mnk3/rog1 pretty much rules out that possibility, right?   Unless UMD is set high, 21 (20) for this build/server, it's advantages are few since arcane scrolls will mostly fail on the casting check (though some low-level wands should be handy).<br/>\n<br/>\nI would hesitate relinquishing any dispel-immune source of AB (i.e. BAB).  You didn't forget how lowly 16 cleric levels is as far as dispelling goes, did you?   Until you reach clc 14, even lesser dispels will force you to rebuff.  Not to mention the XP penalty which will be slowing down your advance with that tertiary class mucking things up.  On a low-magic server?  I'd pass.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am still baffled how you can possibly prefer ANY domain over Travel on a server without permahaste items.  Makes no sense to me.  Haste affects both casting speed, APR and attack progression and practically replaces the need for Imp 2-wpn fighting, at least until it becomes available.   If you can find enough combat rounds to be pausing to gulp down another Speed potion and not get killed by AoOs when doing so, I bow to your combat prowess.    Concealment is nice, but not THAT nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I would stick with Xbow for those rare occasion where spells are not appropriate.  Decide on a primary attack, develop it and refrain from diluting it to acquire \"handy\" stuff like access to longbows.  I'm sure Max will agree full-heartedly on this point because he has chided me on several occasions for not remembering this basic ECB fact..  Power rules! <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you would rather play an archer, go with AA.  Even within 18-20 levels, it can be a nasty alternative to cleric on a low-magic environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nUmmm, D'Alessandro...

If the cleric's Find Traps spell has been nerfed, as is the case on many of the rebalanced servers, it will only identify the traps (like a wide-range, auto-success Search check).. not disarm them.   It makes a difference, especially before your toon has enough HP to withstand the damage.  In some cases, you can send your summon to absorb a trap but would need to spot it first even to do that.   The worst traps usually have elevated detection DCs so you don't want to miss those. <br/>\n<blockquote><div>\nI choose War domain to easily cap my DEX and wear items, that rise other stats, since not much dex items available too.

Why intentionally handicap your toon without Travel domain?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust for reference, with your latest build schedule, here is your early unbuffed, single-handed, melee AB progression for Levels 1-7:<br/>\n01: -1  (for example: 0 BAB - 1 Str  w/o finesse)<br/>\n02: 0<br/>\n03: 5<br/>\n04: 5 <br/>\n05: 6 <br/>\n06: 6 <br/>\n07: 6 <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you dual-wield early, it will be MUCH worse. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt least your first 7 levels will be tough to hit anything so I would take Max's advice and settle for leeching experience off your summons and/or party mates with any handy range weapon until level 8-10 or so.

Hip thinks it's traps, I think it's UMD.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, Hip, you are absolutely right, Power rules!! <br/>\n<br/>\nOne more thing, not being the tank doesnt mean not meleeing. You can, for example, have your summon attract the aggro an then join it, but, for the first levels, a heavy crossbow will be better. The only problem I have with it is that once you get extra attacks, you only have 1 APR with it. From a certain point on, you will be better off with a sling.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You shouldn't have so much trouble finding items to justify using 5 Haste potions each combat whilst using maybe 3 Improved Invisibility wand charges before each rest.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you even know what Haste does? Just to make sure let me tell you:<br/>\n<br/>\n- 1 extra attack per round AT FULL BAB (although if you have it simultaneously with Divine Power, it'll give you an extra attack at full bab -5)<br/>\n- +4 Dodge AC, which stacks with anything else, including Monk boots<br/>\n- Double speed when casting spells, meaning you can fire two spells in the same round (but not when using items like scrolls, wands, ioun stones, etc...)<br/>\n- And obviously more movespeed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Haste as a spell, you can extend it to increase the duration to 32 rounds, (with your 16 Cleric levels), much much much better than the regular 5 Rounds of a Haste potion. For Trickery to be better for you, you would need to find 10x more Haste potions than Improved Invisibility items, because of their pathetic duration. We are trying to help you here, mate, but you have to want to help yourself too, you know? We've told you at least 4 times that Haste is much more important than II, but if you refuse to believe us, then there isn't much we can do.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I know all that about this spell. And you totally right. Maybe I just needed to read this all once more in one message to understand. Or simply I loose some skills while stoped play NwN ) <br/>\nI will go with Travel &amp; War in this one, and I will start test it today.<br/>\n<br/>\nMax, Hip, huge thanks to you both. I will come soon with another idea to discuss. But now I will look once more to this one, re-think all and finally start to play )<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It's sad, but it's the only thing he can do.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
