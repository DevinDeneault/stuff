      "content": "<div>Heya, folks!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last day of idleness before I disappear again into the darkness of RL. There are many many builds with this class combo, yet none that go for the maximum possible DevCrit DC, well not quite the maximum as he's not a Half-Orc, but I tried to focus on AB and STR, rather than going for EDR or CON enhancements, like most of the other ones I saw, ending up with the highest STR of its kind. He gets lots of pre-epic feats, so he's proficient with bows and especially in melee, able to disarm and KD many foes. Can turn on IPA against those low AC - high DR mobs, or IE against those high AB - low AC mobs. I Haven't come up with a name yet, but I will before posting it.

      "content": "<div>Then that would be DevCrit DC of 46. Right?<br/>\n<br/>\nWould you be willing to settle for DC 45, Max?  If you would, I believe you can find 3 spare feats and DevCrit with two different weapons.  True.  Your AB for longbow is a bit pedestrian, but unless the enemy is extremely high AC all it takes is one out of the four APR hitting each round.  How lucky is your dwarf? *lol*  Actually, WS in longbow is probably a waste since your AB won't be all that reliable.  So why try to inflict damage with a bow under those circumstances?  And without a Mighty +16 long bow, you'll be getting gipped big time. IMO, I'd draw out the bow and start plunking from distance, hoping to crit and beat their fort (with Imp Crit in LB, chances will increase a bit).  Any gremlins that get through into melee range, park the bow and start to wail with your tried-and-true dwarf's companion.  After all, who ever heard of a REAL dwarf pretending to be an elf shooting pointy sticks?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust an idea.  I've seen DevCrit bowyers before (mainly AA/RDD's) but never were they combo'd with another DevCrit weapon.  Have you?  (BTW, maybe you are aware... maybe not...DevCrit does NOT need weapon focus.  The in-game description lies.)</div>"

I thought of doing something like a dual-wielding devcritter of 2 weapons, like the Dwarven Waraxe and a Kukri on the offhand, but then I would need 15 dex so I forgot about it. IDK about the bow devcrit because I generally just snipe a bit to pull enemies out then switch to melee to finish them off. However, as usual, that's a good insight. There are many feats to spare, as most of them are taken just because Fighter is used pre-epic for 30 BAB. I also considered taking Iron Will, Luck of Heroes and those kinds of feats instead of the bow focus, but decided not to because immunities are better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am aware that DC doesn't need WF, don't worry, so you can pretty much just pick 3 pre-epic feats that aren't requirements and drop them, IPA, IE, Disarm and Improved Disarm, there are many droppable feats, if anyone wants to DevCrit with the bow, then just pick 3 of them <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

I like your thinking, as usual. The thing is that you play this game so much different that most of the stuff you suggest doesn't apply to my playstyle or to where I play, but can and should be noted as a viable alternative for those with a style of play closer to yours. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I just remembered there is a build that goes for devcrit in bows and swords, it's called The Devastating Specialist of Blade and Bow, and I THINK (could be very wrong here) it was posted by Jennalee in the old guild forums. I don't remember the spread or the class combo she used, sadly, so I can't find you the link. I will alter the build with your suggested tweaks and repost that as an alternat version, rather than a changed one, cuz I'm still thinking of doing a third one with some other feats pre-epic, mostly the saves, we'll see how it goes, then we can debate on which one is better. Thanks for the input, mate!</div>"

Mick did it with AA like I figured, using scimi/lb.  Actually, it's a superior AB overall as would be expected with AA and reaches a DC 40 yet.  Not too shabby.  As an AA one is stuck with a bow though, so there is still some merit to leaning towards xbow if critting is at the top of your list.  And his doesn't have the special attacks that all those fighter levels will allow in your design.  I think I played something like his on a server with +10 bows once upon a time.  I prefer low-magic all the time now, though, and that usually means DevCrit has been seriously nerfed or banned.<br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>Empyre65 wrote:</strong> <br/>\nHow about giving up 2 AB and 4 pre-epic feats to take 4 Bard and 4 RDD pre-epic, so you can get some of the RDD goodies much earlier?

That leaves us with Ftr 25/RDD 10.  Where are those extra fighter levels coming from?  28 + 4 = 32?  Or do you mean you shifted 4 bonus feat slots from pre-epic to epic? Not following.  Overall, that combo loses 2 feats.  Which 2 are you figuring to sacrifice?  There are an awful lots of pre-epic feats selected so they will either need to be taken in epic or just plain lost.  I really don't see where additional bard levels does anything but dilute the original power.  The \"goodies\" of 4 RDD pre-epic is +1 AC &amp; +2 STR.  meh.</div>"

Max basically said he had so many pre-epic feats he didn't know what to do with them all (I paraphrase). It would be up to Max which feats to lose.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince 4 RDD levels are moved to pre-epic, that creates a 4-slot hole in epic to be filled with Fighter levels, as I described. You would wind up with Fighter 24 / Bard 6 / RDD 10, and at level 20, it would be Fighter 12 / Bard 4 / RDD 4. The final AB would be only 1 less, thanks to addition of Epic Prowess.<br/>\n<br/>\nFour RDD levels gets you +4 STR, not just +2. Also, because when you start taking RDD levels in epic, you'll be starting with the 5th level of RDD instead the 1st, my suggestion could result in reaching RDD 10, with all the goodies that brings, four levels earlier. This would depend on when you take those \"extra\" epic levels of Fighter (the 4 levels of Fighter displaced from pre-epic to epic by the 4 moved levels of RDD).<br/>\n<br/>\nAn idea just occurred to me, He could opt to have only 2 pre-epic levels of Bard instead of 4, ending with Fighter 26 / Bard 4 / RDD 10, with one fewer lost pre-epic feats, and no change in BAB from my original suggestion. This way at level 20, you would have Fighter 14 / Bard 2 / RDD 4.

My own suggestion involved a direct sub of Imp Crit: LB for WF: LB and then losing 1 AB (and 1 DC) in epic by sacrificing 2 Grt STR.  But the combo would be identical and all the combat diversity retained as he, I assume, designed it to be.  I don't think he is desiring to shed either AB nor feats, especially since his range attack AB is rather low to begin with...but i could be reading his prereqs wrong.  Kudos for the 4 RDD STR boost notation.  Missed that. *doh*<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I wondered why he took that first bard level when he did, but its placement isn't all that significant to me, just the final skill dump.

That has many implications on WoG, since most of the desireable magic items need over 20 UMD to be worn. Anyhow, that's indeed minor. I am stil undecided whether to relinquish 1 AB for devcrit with another weapon. I can see the merit in it, but I can't see its usefulness in my playstyle. I'll make reference to that as a very interesting tweak if it suits a certain playstyle. I seriously barely use bows with STR toons, cuz the AB with them is just so much lower than your melee AB that if you're fighting anything in your level range, you'll miss on 3 out of 4 APR and do 5 damage on the one you hit. <br/>\n<br/>\n@ Empyre65<br/>\n<br/>\nI would be willing to drop PRE-EPIC feats, absolutely, what I wouldn't be willing to drop is BAB, and my build DOES get Epic Prowess, at lvl 40, true, because it's not really all that needed. It ends with 50 AB naked +5 from GMW (which I can get in a wand as long as I can buy one, I even have a supplier already on WoG), +6 from Capped STR, +1 from Bless and +1 from Aid potions that's 63 AB, which is above par on WoG. I also know of a place to buy True Strike scrolls for those battles where that AB isn't enough to constantly hit the opponent.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the spellcraft, thanks, that was really helpful. The colors in the CBC mix up in my eyes. They could've made the difference in Class / Cross Class skills more perceptible to the Human eye by filling the cells that correspond to the cross-class skills with a better color. Anyhow, I will make that change right now. And I will revise the build to try to get other useful feats in, relinquishing the ranged weapon focus altogether. If that one ends up worse than this one, then I will try out Hip's suggestion and devcrit with a ranged weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the input. Now that I can't play for a while, I will have some time to work on that build. Cya soon!</div>"

      "content": "<div>@ Empyre65<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the tweaks you suggested pre-epic are not to my liking. I love cleave right from the start, it's the most useful feat until you get a second attack per round. I don't see why you'd even consider getting Disarm and Improved Disarm in different levels. Do you like receiving attacks of opportunity or were you simply planning on not using it for 2 levels? Blind Fight where I play is not needed till around level 15, but if you feel you need it earlier, it's very doable, just not at the expense of early Cleave IMO, and as for Toughness, I just dislike the feat. It gives you an extra HP per level, meh. Only reason I took it was because there was nothing better to get. These tweaks are minor, however, and could be easily implemented if they suit your playstyle.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow as for you suggested post-epic tweaks, they're all good. In fact, there is a way to attain RDD goodies even earlier than what you've suggested. I've just noticed that, I will post an altered version shortly. Thanks for the help!<br/>\n<br/>\n@ Mick<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, mate, my bad <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"
