(I...I haven't played 2 yet. I'm sorta disappointed in myself xD)<br/>\n<br/>\n Server: Arelith, 30 cap.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Okay, so here's my story. I was playing through (Warning unfamiliar games potentially ahead) Heroes of Might and Magic V and .Hack (Ps2). Going through the motions of playing a commander, and a twin blade each respectively. I ended up fighting for the elven race on heroes, and came across something that hadn't crossed my mind in a while. A twin blade. I thought funnily enough that I might try to build an elven twin blade (two longswords I guess, not sure if anything else is better.) Unfortunately, I couldn't come up with a lot of things. For one, would Dex or Str make more sense? What feats or classes would I need? I know dual wielding feats makes sense. But, I couldn't figure out the specifics. (I know what I want, just not how to go about it.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n My thoughts would be Longswords, unless there's a better alternative. I hear you can dual wield Katanas but unsure if that would be a good idea. I wasn't sure of the skills either. I thought Heal, and trap related things might also be needed (to suppliment the blades) This entire concept of a dual twin blade is kinda foreign to me. The race would be elven.<br/>\n<br/>\n I was wondering if you all could help? Perhaps, explaining the advantages and cons of a STR or DEX Twinblade (if there even are any. I don't even know if this is a feasible idea, let alone anything else)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

When you say \"twin blade\", are you looking to wield two weapons, or one double-sided one? I ask because recommendations might be different depending on that, including whether a STR or DEX-based build would work best (whether Finesse-able shortswords might serve you better, for example). Also, I don't know if Arelith gives an xp penalty when a race strays from its favoured class (for Elf it's Wizard, I believe), or how bothered you'd be about playing with any penalty?<br/>\n<br/>\n You could go down a Weapon Master route, but that might be problematic in getting all the qualifying feats along with the dual-wielding ones. Pairing it with Fighter would give you more feats to combat that, or Ranger could deal with all the D-W feats (if you took 9 levels in it and didn't wear heavier than Light Armour). And if you want trapping skills, some Rogue might well be worth an investment as well. As you can see, there are many options available, and it would just be helpful if you could offer a few more specifics before those most likely to be of use to you head off in a direction you're not looking for.

Fighter for feats, wm for ab and rogue for skills?

If they are using Finessed weapons, their DEX bonus will work on their AB like STR does ordinarily, so they'll be hitting just as often as a STR build would - they just wouldn't be dealing as much damage with each strike. Now, Elves get an automatic bonus to their DEX at creation, so that would maybe indicate that's the road to travel, but another way of looking at it is to say: it's easier to get an Elf to a DEX bonus of +1, and so wear all heavy armour without penalty, which then means I could put more points into STR.

Since you don't seem to know whether you want a str-based toon or a dex-based one, let us get started by outlining the advantages and disadvantages of each one:<br/>\n<br/>\n STR- the first thing you need to know is that a STR-based dual-wielder will have REALLY LOW AC. Therefore, it won't succeed if it stands toe-to-toe with the enemy. So, if you go STR, I suggest you get Shadowdancer for HiPS. That's the only way you won't die over and over again. My <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2354417/#.WMXPRoWcHIU\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Subtle Death</a> is a good example of one such build. He's a STR-based dual-wielding Assassin. This kind of build does a lot of damage (many attacks per round, lots of STR bonuses to add to them). And if you take classes with Sneak Attack or Death Attack, that's even more damage! However, you also TAKE a lot of damage, so you're bettter off letting someone else in your party do the tanking. If you plan to walk around alone, you might have a hard time staying alive.<br/>\n<br/>\n DEX- on the opposite side of the damage spectrum, you have AC that will allow you to stand in the pocket, possibly Epic Dodge to dodge the first attack you receive each round (after a long time), and you'll basically pinch your opponent. So your source of damage will have to be probably sneak attacks or weapon buffs, such as Darkfire or Flame Weapon. DEX is also an ability that modifies many good skills, so Rogue or Assassin should be almost a no-brainer (maybe even both).<br/>\n<br/>\n So basically, STR vs DEX boils down to AC vs Damage. AB, as Stag has already pointed out, will be the same, because of Weapon Finesse (as long as you wield a finesseable weapon).<br/>\n<br/>\n So, first things first. STR or DEX?<br/>\n<br/>\n And since we're at it, would you like a spellsword (something with buffs to help you make the transition to the dark side?)\u00a0or something more of a straight meleer who buffs through consumables?<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and if you're planning to learn how to build, the Game Guides section looks like a good place to start.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Maybe I got too swept up in thinking Weapon Master, particularly in a non DevCrit environment. Your suggestion would negate the necessity of taking essentially redundant feats, increase the number of feats and give saves a much-needed boost. What do you reckon, Valerionx?<br/>\n<br/>\n If you're okay with it, the first things we'll then have to consider are the vital statistics (and I believe you have this \"gift\" thing in Arelith to factor in there as well) and pre-Epic AB versus getting Epic Dodge asap (given that we'll need at least 13 levels of Rogue - to get Improved Evasion and Defensive Roll, 30 points in Tumble, and DEX of at least 25 before the feat becomes available. So level 27 at the earliest). Given the class split, I can't see us not losing at least 2 AB pre-Epic, but I wouldn't really want to lose any more than that in a melee build - particularly a D-W one. Maybe a way of striking a balance would be to take the first 4 levels as Rogue, then 4 as Fighter (we'd need that many before CoT becomes available), then work out when to take 4 more Rogue levels and 8 of CoT - giving us a Rogue 8/Fighter 4/CoT 8 pre-Epic split, and a BAB of 18. That would mean Rogue 8/CoT 2 in Epic, and a final BAB of 23.<br/>\n<br/>\n How does that strike you as a first thought, Valerionx?</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I messed around a bit on the cbc sheet, and made a rogue/cot/harper, because of the two great dex feats that can be taken on the harper levels. Also the harper goodies are a bit better on arelith, however I wasn't fully satisfied with the results. I'll look into the fighter version.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Although I can certainly see us getting ED at level 27 and Crippling Strike at level 30. I've reckoned on 14 pre-Epic feats/bonus feats, of which 10 are pretty much must-haves, with 8 others in mind as should/could-haves. And 5 in Epic (4 feats and 1 CoT bonus feat, as well as 3 Rogue-specific bonus feats). I also think we have 246 skill points to allocate, assuming a starting INT of 14.<br/>\n<br/>\n I also need to ask a few Arelith questions, if that's okay? How many \"gifts\" would an Elven Rogue get at creation (major and/or minor)? I ask because it could impact on character vitals, skill distribution and feats in Epic levels. I notice that Fighter gets +1 Discipline every 3 levels: is that regardless of anything else? Would taking a background as Wild Child be beneficial? And if so, would the +1s in Tumble, Hide and Move Silently count as modifiers or input skills (so, would we only need to take 29 ranks in Tumble rather than 30 for both the AC and Epic Dodge?). And this katana thing: I'm still unclear as to whether it is now <strong>both</strong> a light weapon <strong>and</strong> finesseable, or merely finesseable? It makes a difference - and will also determine whether we need to take WProf:Exotic or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and I recognise that it's 3 levels in a row, rather than 4: so I'd now probably start with 3 Rogue levels, then 3 Fighter, then 1 more Rogue and 1 more Fighter before breaking into CoT at level 9.<br/>\n<br/>\n Hope this makes sense.

Fighter, I guess so,\u00a0 Wild child.. looking at it, probably would be worth it, -2 to appraise and bluff isn't a whole negative I don't guess. Modifiers or input skills. I don't have a clue I imagine it increases the skill +1 kinda like an extra more than baseline, but I dunno. Katana is both light and finesseable, according to the thread in the server information.\u00a0 I'm going to try and build something up later today, though I don't know how good it will be. I'll post my attempt later xD</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
