(HAK and OVERRIDE versions) They are retextured, have much more polygons, increased details, pseudo-Bloom, pseudo-BumpMapping effect , Tile build-in pseudo-random model generator, build in sun ligths rays effect, 3d landscapes and ceillings.<br/>\nThey are all compatible with the allfade system.<br/>\nThey come with visuals effects placeables like animated lens flares, animated sunlight rays and animated sunlight windows rays.<br/>\nWith NWNCQ override, oc and every pw or mod you play in will be improved.<br/>\nCEP2 and ProjectQ are fully compatibles but not required.<br/>\nConfigure your NWNCQ-OVERRIDE with [cfgnwncq] program placed in you override folder, to switch on or off every tilesets of NWNCQ. <br/>\n<br/>\nNWNCQ V1.3 is here!<br/>\n<br/>\nSelect the patch of your version to upgrade it from 1.2 to 1.3<br/>\n<br/>\nNew features:<br/>\n-New hill system (for HAK and Override-Extended versions only)<br/>\n-New bloom effect, to be used with NWshader<br/>\n-Just added NWNCQ-scifi addon friends. Add this HAK to NWNCQ on your module to experience NWN in a SCIFI world. Lots of all new exteriors, (terraforming plants, futurist desert town), interiors (base) and scifi placeables. Add \"nwncq-scifi-d20.hak\" on top of your hak list to be compatible with D20.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be even closer to every tastes i'll give you not less that 5 nwncq flavors:<br/>\n<br/>\nNWNCQ-Basic: Good for players who want be closer to original nwn design, no obstrusion, less polys, no terrain deformations, no interiors textures. On the same package you'll be able to upgrade NWNCQ-Basic to NWNCQ-Basic-PLUS by simply copying \"Plus Version addon\" override's subfolder in your override folder or use the [nwncqconfigurator] program (please backup you override before). NWNCQ-Basic-PLUS is the same as Basic but with interiors textures.<br/>\n<br/>\nNWNCQ-Extended: Good for players who want to use the full power of NWNCQ, very low obstrusions, more polys, terrain deformation, all textures. On the same package you'll be able to upgrade NWNCQ-Extended to NWNCQ-Extended-PLUS by simply copying \"Plus Version addon\" override's subfolder in your override folder or use the [nwncqconfigurator] program (please backup you override before) .NWNCQ-Extended-PLUS is the same as Extended but with even more polys, for ultimate details but a little more obstrusions (No walkthrougts issues, as you'll be able to walk througt models like statues, trees, pillars ect...). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>******************************</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother amazing improvement on NWN dated graphics. You gotta have this one.</div>"
