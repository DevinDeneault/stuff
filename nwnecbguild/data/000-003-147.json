      "content": "<div>Hey David!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was the one who referred you here from the NWN Facebook page. I understand you're just getting started, which is always tough, and the amount of information that you'll find here can be overwhelming at first, but if you persist, you'll raise your knowledge of the game to a whole new level.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis guild has been around for way longer than this forum. It used to be located in the Bioware Official forums, where in the golden days of NWN, dozens of GREAT character builders fervorously debated their opinions on builds and class features. Nowadays, it's been more quiet around here, most have retired from the game and moved on to ones with better graphics, but at least for me, there will never be a better game than NWN. It's SO BEAUTIFULLY COMPLEX, there are SO MANY POSSIBILITIES that even after 8 years of playing it, I still have lots of things left to explore. Up until last year I had never played a character who was proficient with traps, for example, and I found it to be extremely fun to set traps and then attract the monster's attention an watch it burst into pieces in a green carpet of death! Still haven't played an Arcane Archer either, except in the Training Mod (yes, there are several modules where you can test your builds) when I was making a Cleric / AA toon.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the way the system works, the possibilities of making optimized character concepts are close to endless. When we don't know much about the game, we think exactly the way you are thinking with this character of yours: I'm gonna make a Bard. And then try to combine it with a class that \"makes sense\" in terms of RP for the more RP-friendly or in terms of power, for people like me, powergamers. But there is SO MUCH MORE to it than you can possibly know at this point, so I'm going to refer you to an article that I wrote that will hopefully get you started and arise your curiosity to delve deeper into this world of endless possibilities that is building optimized NWN toons.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the link: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/a-complete-guide-to-the-basics-of-character-building-t515440.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A Complete Guide to the Basics of Character Building</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHope you're willing to take the journey, friend.

      "content": "<div>Hey man!<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn't mean to be offensive, nor do I mean it now, but even though you have been playing this game for quite some time, you lack a lot of information, which makes you kind of a newbie, a newbie who has been playing the game for 7 years, but a newbie nonetheless. If you've never come in contact with the information that we provide here, there is no way for you to learn, so there's no shame in not knowing. Now you have the option to learn A LOT OF NEW STUFF, such as epic feats, epic spells, character optimization, etc.. not to mention in-game strats to play better. But you need to start somewhere, and here, you should start by reading my guide to the basics of character building. If you read it, I'm sure you'll realize how much you don't know. Again, no offense, but you should realize where you are right now to be able to reach to where you want to be, provided, again, that you want to take the journey.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, let me tell you what tells me that you're not very familiar with the complexity of this game: <br/>\n<br/>\n1- You want to make a Bard 35 HS 5 character with no third class. Unless where you play there is a special bonus for near-pure characters, that's bad, according to our standards. I'll try to explain it a little better now. If you added Fighter or CoT (Champion of Torm), you'd get bonus feats, +1 attack per round, +1 BAB, and in the case of Fighter, access to WS / EWS (Weapon Specialization, Epic Weapon Specialization) to increase your damage output, while with CoT levels you'd get a bonus to your saves, access to Divine Wrath and Smite Evil. That's just off the top of my head. RDD wouldn't give you an extra attack per round, but it would drastically increase your Strength and give you Fire immunity, which is nice, but I still prefer Fighter or CoT. AH! Fighter would also give you Martial Weapons Proficiency and all armor and Shield proficiencies as well, which your toon doesn't have. CoT will give that too, but you need Weapon Focus to qualify for CoT, so you would either need focus on 2 weapons (1 to qualify and another one to wield as your weapon) or you'd need to be content with a simple weapon such as a Morning Star and get the armor proficiency that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n2- You picked SEVERAL pre-epic feats in epics, which is again, bad, unless the build is feat-starved. That is actually a reflex of the above decision, because by not adding a third class to the mix, you're left with a whole lot of Bard bonus feats that have a very limited and unattractive selection for you to pick from, so you just random-picked them. The order you chose feats is also bad. No Curse Song for such a LONG TIME in the build really hurts playability. You should move it to pre-epic for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n3- You started the toon with 12 CHA and 10 Wisdom, being a BARD (what use does a Bard have for Wisdom that justifies taking points away from Charisma?). Unless it's forbidden to start with more than 1 negative attribute, I don't see the point in lowering your Charisma to put points in Wisdom.<br/>\n<br/>\n4- You have a toon with 8 DEX and no Heavy Armor Proficiency, and yet you took Artist at lvl 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's probably more if I look in depth, but I think this is enough to make my point very clear. The problem when you play in such high magic worlds, is that it becomes more of a treasure hunt. What difference does it make if you have Epic Weapon Specialization to add 6 Damage to your weapon if it's a +20 weapon with 2d12 of Divine damage, etc... Normally, I prefer lower magic, because my knowledge of the game makes a difference there.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would normally point out many tweaks that you could make to make this guy more powerful, but they're just SO MANY, that this time I'm going to take the liberty of doing something a little different. I ask you to please not be offended by this, many people don't like when someone posts a different build in their build thread. <br/>\n<br/>\nA while back, I went on a building frenzy and took on the challenge of designing optimized concept builds for each of the Henchmen in the OCs (stands for Original Campaigns), but they still needed to make sense from a RP angle, so no Wizard levels in Daelan Red Tiger's build, for example. I made some really cool builds, one of which uses Bard and HS. It's the build I made for Sharwyn. I tried to keep the same weapons that they wielded in the OCs, so that's why she carries a Two-Bladed Sword, but that's obviously changeable.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust for the sake of comparison, look at your build, calculate the stats and then compare them to Sharwyn's, yes?<br/>\n<br/>\nBard(23), Fighter(12), Harper Scout(5), Human<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 15 (30)<br/>\nDEX: 15<br/>\nCON: 10<br/>\nWIS:

You obviously don't have a lot to choose from with so many Bard bonus feats, but what hurts is that you spend so much time without Curse Song. Here's what I'd do, I'd get rid of Lingering Song, because at the level it's taken, you go from 100 rounds to 105 rounds, which is hardly worth a dime. Try adding some metamagic to increase the efficiency of your buffs, like Empower or Extend instead. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know what you mean by smiles, or how important they are where you play, so I can't say anything about them, but TBH, I'd never trade power for smiles.

      "content": "<div>Well, it'll be hard considering you take Artist (which I would drop), then Alertness and Iron Will for HS requirements, so unless you let go of the idea of getting 35 Bard levels, I don't think it's possible because you take all of these combat feats without any bonus feats. My instinct, as I said, would be to take Fighter levels, which would give you LOADS of Bonus Feats and increase your BAB by 2, which would grant you an additional attack per round. You could take 8 levels pre-epic, which grants you 5 bonus feats for you to relocate all your pre-epic combat feats and make room for them. One of them should be Weapon Specialization, which leaves you with 4 to use for WF, IC, KD and IKD. I'd take Expertise too. it's really good.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also recommend you use Taunt, but in your world, there is the possibility that monster Concentration scores will be insanely high due to the high magic.

When we build here we try to make builds that apply to a \"generic world\", although a server-specific bias is nearly impossible, especially if you haven't played many worlds or modules. Then the player in question tweaks the build to fit server-specific criteria (a very common example of this is the focus school in a caster-heavy build that I'll try to describe now). You normally focus on Necromancy for Arcane Casters, but there are servers that have changed the rules of these schools so that you gain extra bonus from choosing certain schools. Like I remember a player telling me that in his server (I think it was Arelith), if you choose focus on Abjuration, you gain bonuses on dispel checks, which means you're harder to dispel. That is a VERY GOOD REASON to take focus in Abjuration for a Caster build, but it will only apply to such an environment. If where you play the combination of Tymora's Smile and Bard Song is deadly, then please, by all means, pursue it, but just for the next time you request a build, try to give as much information as possible. That will avoid things like what happened in the other thread where I posted the Monk build for you with Kamas and you wanted an Unarmed one. I know you didn't know, which is why I'm informing you now, but now you do know: when you ask for a build here at the guild, please try to provide as much information as possible so that we can work on something that is closer to what you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just posted another build in that thread. Imagine my displeasure if I find out now that you actually wanted a build with at least 30 Monk levels for some server-specific reason after I've spent my time trying to build an optimized toon according to the information you gave me on what you were looking for. So anyway, just trying to get you familiarized with the posting rules and explaining the reasoning behind them.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

I figure if I do away with artist and lingering song and choose a subrace <br/>\nthat gives me a weapon focus free I can take all pre epic feats before 20.  I appreciate the help.

      "content": "<div>Hey David.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you have misinterpreted what I wrote. It is our POLICY (so to speak) to ask our members to provide AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE when requesting a build. The reason for that policy is exactly to avoid what happened in your other thread. It's not because I may be upset (which I'm not) that you need to \" be mindful\" of the stuff you say. It's just that it's in everyone's best interest that you provide as much information as possible so that no time is wasted by whoever steps up to help you out with the request.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing about the epic feats is that they're taken as Bard bonus feats (which you get 1 every 3 levels after 20) and which also don't have such a great feat selection to begin with. Maybe you can take some Epic Spells to try them out. Hellball and Greater Ruin are good once-per-day nukes. Mind you that in such high magic, if they're unmodified, they're close to worthless.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, let me take a look at the other thread you started.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

Charisma 16 is the minimum to be able to cast lvl 6 spells.<br/>\nCharisma also gives bonus spellslots (or more more accurately; more castings per day).<br/>\nCharisma increases the DC of the attack spells of the bard.<br/>\nCharisma is the ability that modifies the perform, taunt and UMD skills, and also the social skills like persuade and bluff.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you multiclass with divine classes that have charisma based feats (eg. divine might/shield, divine wrath, divine grace, dark blessing, smite, turn undead, divine trickery, battle mastery, divine strength or divine protection), you will get a synergy effect since charisma serve more purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost builds with bard as major class will stop at cha 16, unless the build has a specific focus that dictates a high charisma.</div>",
