      "content": "<div>Hi all, I recently decided to pick up NWN again after ....10? ..or so years? ...Maybe more actually, back when... I believe 20 was the cap? I might be remembering wrong and I just never got past it...maybe I'm thinking of something else? Ah well.. please forgive any mispelling or improper grammar.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n My idea is I wanted to make a fighter (I think WM might compliment it, not sure). The reason its titled 'Grim Reaper' is I wanted it to use a scythe. Crazy.. I know right? I sure hope not<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, I decided to find a server to call home, and decided upon the most populated one I could find (that wasn't rated 18+ cause.. I don't need to know what potentially goes on in there). So, I picked Arelith. I did some research regarding changes, and to follow in the spirit of things... I'll follow the guideline here.<br/>\n<br/>\n 1) PvM PvP - PvM, I'd rather not PvP.. but I suspect since its roleplay I will have to eventually.<br/>\n<br/>\n 2) Level Cap - 30<br/>\n<br/>\n 3) Race - Human<br/>\n<br/>\n 4) Class Preference - Fighter/WM/? (anything that makes sense with this I suppose.)<br/>\n<br/>\n 5) Melee pref - High Strength<br/>\n<br/>\n 6- Range pref- None<br/>\n<br/>\n 7 - Weapon Preference - Scythe, but... maybe a bastard sword/shield if its still essentially the same<br/>\n<br/>\n 8- Highest enchantment bonus. I'll assume +3? As that seems to be 'high tier' from the forums.<br/>\n<br/>\n 9) - Spell casting - Unless I can shoot laser beams from my hands, I doubt this would help, more only hinder<br/>\n<br/>\n 10- Custom factors - I see that devastating critical is disabled. Whirlwind attack can cause you to 'freeze' up... but I don't really see anything else that hinders. 3 levels in a row? Before picking another class.<br/>\n<br/>\n 11) Legal (PRC) Classes -<br/>\n Arcane Archer<br/>\n Blackguard<br/>\n Champion of Torm<br/>\n Dwarven Defender<br/>\n Shadowdancer<br/>\n Weapon Master\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n ...The rest are off limits or behind walls of such.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n I found these changes to fighter just as I was about to submit. ...Not sure if they mean anything. <ul><li>+1 Discipline each 3 levels.</li> <li>+1 <em>Strength</em> OR <em>Dexterity</em> each 10 levels.</li> </ul> The stat bonus is <em>Strength</em> unless the base <em>Dexterity</em> is larger than the other. <ul><li>Shield AC Bonus (+1 at 5, +2 at 25, +3 at 30)</li> <li>Armor AC Bonus (+1 at 10, +2 at 25, +3 at 30)</li> <li>Helmet AC Bonus (Deflection) (+1 at 15, +2 at 25, +3 at 30)</li> <li>Weapon Attack Bonus (+1 at 20, +2 at 25, +3 at 30)</li> <li>Weapon Damage Bonus (+1 at 20, +2 at 25, +3 at 30)</li> </ul> All the AC, Attack and Damage bonus <strong>stacks</strong> with equipment.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thank you for your time. If I missed anything let me know, and I'll try to answer. (Again sorry for the english)</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hi there, Zeraxium - afraid all I can do do is say WELCOME! Back to the heartland, eh?<br/>\n<br/>\n Sorry, but I don't know Arelith other than bits I've read here. All I can really offer is that in a level 30 capped world with no Dev Crit, I wouldn't have thought WM (the Critmeister, if you will) would necessarily be your best secondary class, except for the Scythe damage, that is. It's just all the prereqisite feats that could bite you. If a STR- based scyther is what you're looking for, how about adding Bard and RDD to Fighter? I would suggest Barbarian, but with only 30 levels in total, I ain't sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n Maybe something to think on?<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers, and grand to meet you <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/11.gif\"/></div>",

Whilst I still want to do it. I've read it suffers heavily in AC, and require luck to hit. (Just saw a screenshot, and someone has like a 70 AC Barb I believe. Don't think they'll mind me showing off a public picture. <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://s32.postimg.org/hqjjotw1x/AC_is_Crit_immunity_2.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://s32.postimg.org/hqjjotw1x/AC_is_ ... nity_2.jpg</a> ) I like the idea... I could RP a farmer who... just so happens to be awesome.

Though, I'll imagine due to getting such a high hit chance. It must sacrifice something of equal value. ...If not that's one over the top AA xD</div></div>"
