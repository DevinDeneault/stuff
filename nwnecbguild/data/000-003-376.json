      "content": "<div>I'd like to add to what Mick has already pointed out the fact that anything higher than SD 1 is a waste of levels. <br/>\n<br/>\nEverything that SD gives you, Rogue does too, except for HiPS, which by default comes at level 1. So my question is, why more SD? Is there a level restriction of some sort in your server where you must take at least 5 levels of each class?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know you don't like negative values in your stats, but you're unnecessarily thinning the build's important stats. You can argue that the strength of your character comes from his god and get it down to 8, since Divine Power will make it 18 regardless. You gotta remember that Clerics already have to divide stat points between two stats (Wisdom and either DEX or STR). I'd advise you to go 8 STR and 8 CHA and just find some RP justification.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me, this build, although great for Dual Wielding because of Sneaks AND Cleric buffs, is already too feat-starved to take these feats without severely hampering your other combat abilities. How will you generate sneaks without KD / IKD? What good are all these d6 SA damage if you hardly ever get to apply them? You will attack out of hiding, which is nice, but once the opponent engages, you won't be Sneaking them anymore. Now, if you attack out of hiding with KD, that's a whole different story.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd change much in that build. Here's what I'd do.<br/>\n<br/>\n1- Rework the starting stats, try to pump up your DEX a bit as per Mick's suggestion.<br/>\n2- Get rid of all SD levels for 2 Rogue and the rest Cleric. You gain an extra Rogue Bonus Feat at Rogue 19, 1d6 more Sneak Attack damage, may lose a few skill points, but you'll get the ability to cast level 9 spells. They aren't that great without high Wisdom, but still better than nothing. This would make the build Cleric 20 / Rogue 19 / SD 1. Another alternative is Cleric 15 Rogue 24 SD 1, which would give you another extra feat and more Sneaks, Skill points, but you'd be way more dispellable and your buffs wouldn't last as long.<br/>\n3- Take KD / IKD and Extend Spell instead of the dual-wielding feats. There just isn't any room for them. They'd be nice to have.<br/>\n4- Delay Weapon Focus to level 18. NO 15-LEVEL CLERIC needs +1 AB at that stage. EVER! It's only good as a requirement for EWF in epics, so delay it as much as you can.<br/>\n5- Take Extend Spell at level 6, after Weapon Finesse.<br/>\n6- If you can't find room for Blind Fight, drop Silent Spell for it. You're a meleer / Flanker, not a caster, and with your bad Wisdom score, you'll make much use of BF than of Silent Spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt first glance, this is what I'd change. You could also stop your DEX advancement at 26, since 25 is the requirement for Epic Dodge anyway. That would give you 2 feats, with 1 more you could take the dual-wielding feats after all. Think about it at least, but don't drop Blind Fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne more thing: The Naked AC is wrong, 10 is impossible! You MUST take Tumble as a class skill, with your DEX you have AT LEAST 27 AC (8 from Tumble, 9 from DEX modifier, as per Mick's suggestion, otherwise 8 if you choose to leave DEX at 26 as I suggested above).<br/>\n<br/>\nSince we're at it, there's one more guide you gotta read, which is my Complete Guide to the Basics of Building. It'll help you calculate your stats correctly and allocate skill points.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, take a look at this build: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/the-shadow-priest-cleric-26-monk-9-sd5-t515430.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Shadow Priest</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

      "content": "<div>I'm flat out at work today so I'm not sure I'll have time to get another build up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI went Silent over extended based on a conversation between Avado and Whizard in a build form the old forums, essentially saying that silent allowed you to take spells without a duration on multiple levels but thinking about it know it probably applies more to a caster build, not a melee one.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust out of curiousity, how would you go about a melee based, dual wield cleric rogue.  I know monk has good synergy but I would prefer not to use kama's (again RP reasons more than anything else).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I did go monk I would consider changing <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build117547.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ro10/Mo12/C18</a> to 12/12/16 as it seems to cover most of the things i am looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your comments guys, your help is greatly appreciated.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Don't get fancy now, man! LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice to you is: if you want to make a Cleric Rogue SD, follow the advice we gave you, if you want to make a Cleric Monk SD, use the Shadow Priest (just switch weapon if you don't like having 8 APR to apply all your bonus damage from clerical buffs - NOT RECOMMENDED - I'm kidding, just don't like RP choices in a build that much LOL). At least use it as reference, tweak it to your server's specifications if you must, but try not to change too much without at least knowing why I made the choices I made.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Cleric / Monk / Rogue, I recommend this build: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/the-divine-dodger-cleric-23-rogue-16-monk-1-t515547.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Divine Dodger</a>.
