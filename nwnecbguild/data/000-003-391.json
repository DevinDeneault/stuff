I've tried several times to play the monk class on Arelith, but I can't quite find myself doing well. I'd like solo my way if I need to. We are looking at Half-Orc as the base race, though it will be a gnoll! Though I will not be taking the gift that gives you the subrace's standard abilities and skills, so I will be ECL free. I prefer not to have any ECL. As for ability based, I'd like it to have decent AC. So, dexterity!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">A DEX-based Half-Orc? The only reason to ever choose Half-Orc is for the STR bonus. Even if you choose to go STR-based, having penalties in two abilites (both INT and CHA) instead of one, like all the other races, makes me hesitate to recommend it. I recommend Human or possibly Elf.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a DEX-based Monk, how about mixing in some Fighter (for BAB and feats, including Weapon Spec and Epic Weapon Spec) and Shadowdancer (for Uncanny Dodge and access to Epic Dodge, useful even if HipS is nerfed)? Dual-wielding kamas is better for high-magic worlds, but unarmed would be better if Arelith is a low-magic world. Monks are late bloomers, but you should be doing well by late pre-epic levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll wait for feedback from you and the others here before I put the build together for you.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I thought more on the concept, and I thought a mix of Monk 20 Fighter 6 Rogue 4 may be good. Perhaps Monk 21/Fighter 6/Rogue 3.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Because the favored class for a Half-Orc is Barbarian, a Half-Orc Monk / Fighter / Rogue would have a 40% experience point penalty. That might even be worse than a ECL penalty. If we keep two of the classes even, we can keep that penalty down to only 20% (0% for a Human). So, maybe Monk 18 / Fighter 6 / Rogue 6? Alternatively, choosing Monk 20 / Fighter 6 / Rogue 4 would delay the bigger penalty until you take the 6th level of Fighter. These two could focus on either dual kamas or unarmed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we use Shadowdancer instead of Rogue, it would not contribute to the experience point penalty because it is a prestige class. How about a Half-Orc Monk 13 / Fighter 12 / Shadowdancer 5? That would have no experience penalty, and you would dual-wield kamas, and you would get Epic Dodge.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor another approach, how about a STR-based, dual-kama-wielding Half-Orc Monk 10 / Bard 10 / RDD 10? I think I remember that on the Arelith server, a Bard is allowed to be lawful. You would get Tumble as a class skill (6 AC), 2 AC from 10 levels of Monk, and 4 AC from 10 levels of RDD, and no experience penalty. Dev Crit would be a possibility.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Red Dragon Disciple on Arelith sadly required you to sacrafice a level 26+ Character, and even then there's only 5% chance you're able to play the class. If you think that a strength based would be more viable with Half-Orc, then I'd say to go for that. I'd like to keep the damage unarmed, and I'd like to avoid XP penalties as much as I can.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If you want to be unarmed and don't mind losing Epic Dodge, you can be (3) an unarmed Rogue 7 / Monk 17 / Fighter 6.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the skills, you can either be stealthy and set traps, or you can open locks and find and disarm traps.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, choose (1), (2), or (3), and which set of skills you want. If you're not sure which you want, I can make 2 or 3 of those combinations.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
