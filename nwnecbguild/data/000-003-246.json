Otherwise, specify the your favorite.</strong><br/>\n - Human seems best as by my calculations this build will need the extra feat.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>4) Class preference - Describe which class(es) you have been considering so far and why. Your own concept is key to building what will do the job and be the most fun for you to play.</strong><br/>\n .- Paladin/Champion of Torm/Weapon Master<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>5) Melee preference - A few options to consider are: dual-wielding vs. one-hand with shield, high AC dexterity-based vs. high-damage strength-based, sneak attacks (stealth), taunting, specialized attacks (e.g. whirlwind, knockdown, called shots, sneaks, death attacks... you name it!).</strong><br/>\n - Built for high damage output but not looking for a one trick pony that is focused on smite<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>6) Range preference - DEX archery or Zen Archery (WIS)</strong><br/>\n - Not concerned with Range.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>7) Weapon preference - Which weapon type would you enjoy using the most?</strong><br/>\n - Two handed sword , great axe, or long sword. I think I'd prefer a 2 handed weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>8) Maximum item enhancement - In the setting where you intend to play this character, what is the highest enchantment (or bonus) that is likely to be used on equipment?</strong><br/>\n - +3 weapons and armor is the best we can get for the most part.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>9) Spellcasting - If you are requesting a build that is likely to use magic, explain its general use</strong><br/>\n - I don't believe I'll get enough levels of paladin to cast spells.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The problem is that you can't have\u00a0less than 7 levels of Paladin because CoT requires 7 BAB and WM requires so many feats that it's\u00a0unattainable before 7\u00a0unless you take 6 Fighter levels straight. That leaves\u00a0very little room for CoT to reach its potential. Paladin 7 also means you're 1 level away from level 2 spells\u00a0(Bull's Strength would be nice), but you can't get them without giving up Ki Critical for it, which makes it not worth it. I'll see what I can do tomorrow if noone has posted\u00a0something here for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

No spells as you guessed but maybe some (One) Charisma trick(s) could be fit into it.<br/>\n<br/>\n Weapon Focus, Expertise, Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack, Dodge, Mobility, Improved Critical, Blind Fight, Knockdown, Power Attack, Divine Shield<br/>\n<br/>\n STR 14 (<strong>18</strong>)/ DEX 13/ CON 10/ INT 13/ WIS 12/ CHA 15 (<strong>16</strong>)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hmm, i am not entirely pleased with it, but it works and it will have good saves.<br/>\n<br/>\n Let me know what you think of it (those are the rough stats) and if you want i can post a formatted build for you tomorrow, disturbed.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I have a question for you, disturbed. Why Paladin? If you won't cast the wonderful buffs, use the Divine Feats, why not Fighter / WM / CoT? The only thing that Paladin does is not give you any bonus feat to help with requirements. Or alternatively, if you want a Paladin, holy kind of character, why WM? A CoT / WM has a bit of synergy, as CoT feats help with WM requirements, but on a level 20 cap it's a bit impractical, especially if you consider 6 CoT levels will give you 3 feats, and WM requires Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack, Expertise and Weapon Focus. And pretty much Improved Critical too, as you're going for WM for the critical hit enhancements, so not having Improved Critical is kind of impractical. That's 7 feats -3 from CoT still 4 General feats that you need to take. 1-3-6-9-12-15-18 gives you a total of 7 feats.  So 4 of those feats are consumed with requirements, it leaves you only 3 feats for Knockdown, Improved Knockdown, Blind Fight, Power Attack, Divine Might, Divine Shield (which would be your desirable combat feats). IMO it's more restrictive than it is helpful.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
