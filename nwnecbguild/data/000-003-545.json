      "content": "<div>Right, in the spirit of compromise regarding my less than positive attitude to caster-types, and to allow some mockery that hasn't surfaced for a good day or so, I thought I'd have a crack at my first Pally build. I don't promise a vast amount of quality, but it's a start. As I'm sure you'll be able to tell, I haven't looked at any of the existing builds, with all my information coming from Max's\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-holy-class-a-guide-to-paladins-t515492.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Paladin Guide</a> . So I guess we'll see how attentive I've been, alongside everything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's the excuses out of the way, so over to your good selves for critiques - and, no doubt, pointing and giggling.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy way of a back-story, the level progression is driven thus (vaguely)... <br/>\n<br/>\nThe young granddaughter of Keldorn Firecam, together with her parents, both Paladins in their own right, were on missionary service to the Ten Towns, following the sad demise of Hrothgar. She had always believed in the same code and god as her parents, but her faith took an immense blow when both parents were killed by orcs on the way to Icewind Dale. She was saved by a dwarf of Dorn's Deep, who told her the only way to survive was to hone her fighting skills, and leave \"channeling the gods\" to safer climes. and learn she did, using her anger as fuel. After some years, she found herself in Easthaven, which was once again under attack from yetis and orogs directed by the goddess Auril. She felt herself unnaturally moved to aid the troubled citizens, and once again began to find her faith, becoming Easthaven's champion. And the fuel of her belief was fully rekindled when she pressed further into the icy wastes to confront Auril's ministers. Finally defeating the arch-priestess of the winter goddess, Tyr shone his light once more upon her, and her mission began anew, as not only his champion, but his holy representative in the North.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's my story and I'm sticking to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Tyra of the Ten Towns</strong><br/>\nPaladin 12/ Fighter 10/ CoT 18<br/>\nHuman - LG<br/>\n1-40 PvM<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Stats</strong><br/>\nSTR 15 (26)<br/>\nDEX 8 (<em>now that hurts me</em>)<br/>\nCON 14<br/>\nWIS 12 (14)<br/>\nINT 14<br/>\nCHA 14 (20)<br/>\n<br/>\nHPs: 520<br/>\nAC: (<em>horrid without buffs</em>) (naked) 15, (full plate) 23, (+tower shield) 26 <br/>\nBAB: 30<br/>\nAB: (max, melee) 42, (ranged) 30<br/>\nSaves: Fortitude 41, Will 32, Reflex 31.

      "content": "<div>Hmm<br/>\nWhere to start here Stag?<br/>\nThe story is good enough and serves well as background and framework for a RP character.<br/>\nThe build itself makes me wonder what you want with paladin in this build. You get DM, DS, better saves, taunt and a small number of spells.<br/>\nYou can get most of that with 4 or 5 paladin levels. or you can go \"all in\" and take 20 or more paladin levels with full spell casting with more and better buffs and still get enough feats. 12 levels is neither nor.<br/>\nAnother question is if you want a strength build with a fair amount of DM &amp;DS or if you want a high enough charisma to start taking great smite feats and make it a smiter.<br/>\nTaking 18 CoT levels can be ok, but taking great wisdom on the bonus feats to raise wisdom from 12 to 14 looks a bit aimless.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some good builds there to learn from if you use the seach engine. <br/>\nThere is also <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/sword-of-tyr-celestial-smiter-pal26-cot10-ftr4-t2294174.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sword of Tyr</a> a smiter by TyrTemplar here in our 40s section.<br/>\nI have also dug up one of my own drafts for you.

      "content": "<div>I think you make fair and valid points, Mick, thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a couple of things I'll raise in mitigation - not as excuses, you understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I forgot about non-dispellability, which was stupid. So I ended up with Pally 12 for access to level 3 spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, I was guilty of twitching (reverting to type), and ended up falling between two stools: particularly STR v CHA. For example, the Dev Crit DC is pretty rotten, so why do I go for it, when at least Great Cleave, O and D Crit could be replaced with other, more potentially useful feats (such as Extra Turning and Great Smiting(s), with better CHA, which would also improve DM and DS) - or even simply be lost for more Paladin levels?<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, that horrible AC scared me, so I tried to compensate for it by taking Expertise, and boosting HPs with Toughness, which yet again means more feats, which in turn means more Fighter and/or CoT, and therefore fewer Pally levels. Shooting oneself in the foot is a transferable skill, it seems.<br/>\n<br/>\nFourth (now I'm really pushing the boundaries of \"a couple\"), I initially thought I was being quite clever by bumping WIS with CoT, but it would have been just as easy to start with 14 WIS and only 12 CON and having a little more \"faith\" in the build. This would also mean I could either lose some Fighter or CoT levels, so I could use those bonus feats for other things or drop them altogether.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight, I'll go back and clarify my thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again, Mick (oh, and your own build is actually closer to what I was hoping for, so a further thanks for that!)<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",
