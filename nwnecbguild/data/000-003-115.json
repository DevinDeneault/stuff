      "content": "<div>Halfling will not get an xp penalty in a rogue/wizard build, and will even get an extra AB point from small stature. But a halfling will be restricted to tiny weapons (like daggers) if you want to dual-wield.<br/>\n The advice from Hip is valid if you want a spellsword. Things will be much easier if you want something like an \"arcane trickster\" that can focus on magic and rogue skills.<br/>\n Another point is that in a pre epic build, the effect of arcane spells on AB and defence will even let a mage be a decent melee character \u00e1 la the \"Melee Mage\"</div>",

Wizard has spells for opening locks and disarming traps. They also have invisibility spells, so if you don't want stealth skills, you can take pickpocket and a social skill like persuade instead. A pixie familiar will add to the rogue part.<br/>\n The dual wielding costs 3 feats (5 if you sum up all combat feats), but doubles the number of attacks per round.

Expertise is there primarily for casting, hopefully to make the DR spells last longer. <br/>\n If you want to fight: With GMW and empowered cat's the AB bonus becomes +22/+17/+22/+17. The main damage comes from weapon enhancements (GMW , Flame weapon) and empowered Bull's. Flame weapon is an on hit effect, and Imp crit will only effect the damage from the weapon. This is not a spellsword, but the weapons are not there only to look cool. I pointed at fighting mobs if need be.</div>",
