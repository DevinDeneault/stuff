Any units leaving the castle would be filled with arrows long before they could reach the main army of armed warriors.  But suddenly a small band of kama wielders ran out of the castle deftly dodging the arrows.  Splitting up they manage to move around the main army till they reached the archers.  Attacking at amazing speed, these men killed many archers severing their arms with countless blows.  Afterward they ran back to the castle before the troops could reform.  Again and again small bands were released, singing with delight with the aid from the gods, and arcane magical defenses surrounding them.  If the archers failed then the siege would end.  There would be little hope for the warriors without ranged cover if a full-fledged counter-attack came.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis build boasts amazing speed simply from stacking expeditious retreat multiple times.  At higher levels mass haste can be cast to also add an attack to the progression.  The build was inspired by the protagonist Jared in \u201cBlood Magic\u201d, a monk of powerful magic blood who left his order- an order that condemned any \u201ctainted blood\u201d like his.  While Jared\u2019s spells don\u2019t seem particularly potent (except demonic summoning) he does move with unnaturally fast speed, and is constantly running away.  Though Jared is good at unarmed fighting, I gave this build a kama emphasis to make up for low unarmed damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 10 <br/>\nDEX: 16 (32)<br/>\nCON: 10<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 16<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 288 (max roll) 222 (average roll)<br/>\nSkillpoints: 245<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Reflex/Will): 27/42/26<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: +9 vs. spells, +2 to will vs. mind-affecting, evasion<br/>\nBAB: 27<br/>\nAB: 42 (kama no buffs)<br/>\nAPR: (two-kama, no buffs): +40/+37/+34/+31/+28/+25/+40/+35<br/>\nAC: 31 (naked, no buffs)<br/>\n<br/>\nSKILLS<br/>\n281 points<br/>\nConcentration 43<br/>\nDiscipline 43<br/>\nOpen Lock 1 (12) (cross-classed)<br/>\nPerform 43 (46)<br/>\nPersuade 24 (27)<br/>\nSpellcraft 43 (45)<br/>\nTumble 40 (51)<br/>\nUMD 43 (46)<br/>\n<br/>\nLEVELING GUIDE<br/>\n01: Monk (1): Ambidexterity, Two-weapon Fighting<br/>\n02: Monk (2):<br/>\n03: Monk (3): Weapon Finesse<br/>\n04: Monk (4): Dex + 1 (17)<br/>\n05: Bard (1):<br/>\n06: Bard (2): Weapon Focus: Kama<br/>\n07: Bard (3):<br/>\n08: Bard (4): Dex +1 (18)<br/>\n09: Bard (5): Curse Song<br/>\n10: Bard (6): <br/>\n11: COT (1): <br/>\n12: COT (2): Extend Spell, Blind Fight Dex+1 (19)<br/>\n13: COT (3):<br/>\n14: COT (4): Improved Two Weapon Fighting<br/>\n15: COT (5): Extra Smiting<br/>\n16: COT (6): Improved Critical: Kama Dex +1 (20)<br/>\n17: COT (7):<br/>\n18: COT (8): Called Shot, Silent Spell<br/>\n19: Bard (7) <br/>\n20: Bard (8) Dex+1 (21)<br/>\n21: COT (9): Epic Prowess<br/>\n22: COT (10):  Epic Weapon Focus: Kama<br/>\n23: Bard (9):<br/>\n24: Bard (10): Armor Skin, Dex +1 (22)<br/>\n25: Bard (11):<br/>\n26: Bard (12): <br/>\n27: Bard (13): Great Dex I (23)<br/>\n28: Bard (14):  Dex +1 (24)<br/>\n29: Bard (15):  <br/>\n30: Bard (16): Great Dex II (25)<br/>\n31: Bard (17): <br/>\n32: Bard (18): Dex +1 (26)<br/>\n33: Bard (19): Great Dex III (27)<br/>\n34: Bard (20):  <br/>\n35: Bard (21): <br/>\n36: Bard (22): Lasting Inspiration, Dex +1 (28)<br/>\n37: Bard (23): Great Dex IV (29)<br/>\n38: Bard (24): <br/>\n39: Bard (25): Great Dex V (30)<br/>\n40: Bard (26): Great Dex VI, Dex +1 (32)</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hey Whizard, very awkward combo you have going on there. I honestly don't see much synergy, except for the speed stacking thing, which is always nice to flee or to hit'n'run. Now if you go Bard 12 CoT 4 Monk 4  and drop Called Shot and Extra Smiting (or Silent Spell, but with 16 CHA i'd assume ES is more droppable) you lose 1 pre-epic BAB, but can then use your bonus feats to take Armor Skin and Epic Prowess as CoT feats, leaving then the lvl 21 and 24 feats to be used as Great Dexterities, recovering the lost pre-epic BAB and granting you an extra AC point. IMO neither Called Shot nor Extra Smiting are doing much for this build, at least at first glance.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

Well, at least I was able to try it in some coop mainly just to hear comments about the on-screen speed.  They tend to suspect I have hacked my toon somehow, as if I actually had such technical expertise.     <br/>\n<br/>\nProblem with this one here, for me, is none of my haunts provides an alignment manager.  Good-Evil is easier to toggle if they have implemented more-or-less standard alignment rules, but the chaos axis is next to impossible to control due to limited or non-existent opportunities.  A positive in this one here is that, at least it only needs to be switched once.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecommend any good server(s) that provide manual alignment control where I could test this bugger?</div>"

A high APR can squeeze the maximum potential out of this feat.<br/>\n<br/>\nDivine wrath and smite evil are still good perks.  With eagle's splendor, smite evil can raise the AB by five (good for interrupting a spell).<br/>\n<br/>\nGiving up these two for one AC, I don't see as in the best interest of the build, especially since my dex is unsecured.</div>"

Many servers will often have small chaotic shifts for such actions.  The good thing is you have 4 levels to accumulate the 15 chaotic points.</div>"
