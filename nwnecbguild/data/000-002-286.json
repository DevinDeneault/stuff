The OC is more of an introduction to the game than a challenge to your abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe paladin/bg build is really about maximizing charisma and getting really really stupid base saves (the feat from paladin and black guard are NOT the same for some reason, so they stack).  Other than that, you will get a much better character doing a paladin/rog or blackguard/fighter type of thing.  <br/>\n<br/>\nUnless, that is, that I have missed something that you see in the idea!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

So you would need to script a change, then erf the script into the module, recompile, then call it via console (or place the property on an item somehow).  An SP player can change factions and reputation via console but that will not change the toon's alignment.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood/evil axis is the easiest to change going from good towards evil... just kill innocents.  Toggling back towards good is more difficult and depends on if the designer provided a means (like quest rewards, convo responses, etc.).  If not, you are stuck as evil.  The chaos axis is almost impossible to modify without scripting specifically designed to change that in the module.  It is the bane of all good and evil druids.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
