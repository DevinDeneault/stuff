Thus my avoidance in posting this in the Full Level 40 Builds section as it really isn\u2019t possible to do this in the OCs.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n32 Levels of Cleric are taken to be able to defeat standard Toolset Spell Resistance.\u00a0 My reasoning is, if they can resist the spell, fine, but can they resist a barrage of mortar rounds raining down like hellfire?\u00a0 With a high Wisdom and Epic Spell Focus in Evocation, he certainly can end a bad guy\u2019s day with his spells if his sling is running up empty.\u00a0 Craft Wand is taken so he never runs out of GMWs and Darkfire for his mortar rounds, as well as having never ending access to Haste, Invis, and Improved Invis quickslotted for your pleasure.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nThere\u2019s a few feats I would like to have but couldn\u2019t fit them in:\u00a0 <em>Blindfighting</em>, <em>Called Shot</em> <em>and Improved Crit</em>, and <em>Empower Spell</em>.\u00a0 You can mitigate Called Shot by managing the battlefield with SoVs, Hammers, Summons, etc.\u00a0 As for blindfighting, if you are unable to hit a concealed creature, just drop a 46 DC Implosion.\u00a0 That\u2019ll learn them.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nIf one wants to avoid the Halfling XP penalty, one could go Human.\u00a0 You\u2019ll lose 2 AB, but you would be able to pick up one of the feats still on my wish list.\u00a0 I\u2019d probably go for <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Empower Spell. </span><br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nFor skill points, I was able to get everything I wanted and had 40 left over, so you have some leg room there to customize.\u00a0 One may desire to put those into Discipline.\u00a0 With his low strength and no skill foci, I didn\u2019t see a point.\u00a0 He needs to avoid melee in those cases anyway, but he still has a naturally high AC and Concealment to mitigate those circumstances.\u00a0 One could argue to start with a 12 Int, and 14 Con instead (which I tried), but I missed those skill points (it was too tight).<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nMonk is not taken until epics to try to put off inevitable xp penalties for as long as possible.\u00a0 It\u2019s entirely possible that I am wrong in my calculations and there is a 40% xp penalty regardless of how I structured epic level developments.\u00a0 <br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nFinally, it is possible to squeeze in even more natural AB, but it would require some min maxing Wisdom and losing out on ESF: Evocation.\u00a0 Not worth it in my opinion.\u00a0 Alternatively, you may drop 2 Great Wisdoms and pick up 2 Epic Spell Feats\u2014Greater Ruin and Epic Mummy would be my choice.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nI welcome all comments for I believe there is way to still make her better. For instance, I was considering a Cleric29/Ftr6/Monk5 split to accelerate EWS in the build's career.\u00a0 Same net amount of feats, same end wisdom, AC goes up by one.\u00a0 The downside would be lowering Spell Penetration and shorter durations of spells.\u00a0 Cheers my lads!</div>"

      "content": "<div>While I playtested this halfling extensively offline (in order to make sure I got the attack schedule right), I never bothered to look at the xp awarded.\u00a0 My initial hypothesis is I could mitigate the 20% xp penalty by keeping Fighter and Monk within 2 of each other.\u00a0 If human, this would have been correct, but the moment that first Fighter level is taken it inherits a 20%.\u00a0 The moment that first Monk level hits, it becomes 40%.\u00a0 That's a bit untenable, even for me.\u00a0 But like I said, it was a bit of a gimmick (albeit a good one).<br/>\n<br/>\nA few ways to mitigate this if one were still interested (and none of these are good):<br/>\nGo Human.\u00a0 Bring Wisdom to 18 and end with a Wis of 36 to offset the loss of 2 AB from not being Halfling.\u00a0 Up side:\u00a0 i more feat and 43 more skill points.\u00a0 Downside.\u00a0 Min/maxed, loss of AB.\u00a0 AC is probably a wash.<br/>\nDrop Fighter for Rogue.\u00a0 Not ideal.\u00a0 You lose 2 needed feats and EWS.\u00a0 Still saddled with 20%<br/>\nDrop Monk for Rogue.\u00a0 Lose Monk Wisdom goodness.\u00a0 Gain UMD.\u00a0 Still 20%.\u00a0 This is probably the best of the three options.</div>"

A Halfling Cleric / Fighter / Rogue version adds a little sneak attack and uncanny dodge (with 3-4 levels) which might be nice.
