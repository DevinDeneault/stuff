      "content": "<div>Hail, magaiti!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for posting this build and keeping these halls alive. Now, as to the build itself, I would add many suggestions to improve the build, although you would give up a bit of saves. I'll suggest many alterations, mainly pre-epic, as post-epic pretty much all feats are GSs. OK, here we go!<br/>\n<br/>\n1-Drop Luck of Heroes for Expertise, so you can use the Expertise / Taunt combo. I wouldn't say that your AB is decent, I would say it's average at best, being 37 and all, which would cap at 63 with capped STR and +20 enhancement (which Paladins can't reach on their own). In that sense, you can Taunt while in Expertise, gaining 5 AC for free. And it's always nice to have Taunt / Expertise / Power Attack, as these feats make you more versatile. You can fight DR with Divine Might / Taunt / Power Attack, you can drastically increase your AC with no AB penalty with Divine Shield / Taunt / Expertise, etc... This will require that you rework your stats, but it should be easy enough to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n2- Start with STR 15, DEX 8, CON 8, Wis 14 INT 14 CHA 16. That will delay the first Great Smite feat, but you will end up with 18 STR (and +1 AB), 26 CHA and 86 more skill points which your build REALLY could use.<br/>\n<br/>\n3- If you're going to use these three classes, why not go Paladin 29 / CoT 10 / Monk 1? That way you can do more Smite damage, have the same number of feats, but many more spells per day and are undispellable except for Mord's. You will lose +3 to all saves, but IMO it's a very interesting trade. Al level 16 with 14 Wisdom you have 3 lvl 1 spells, 3 lvl 2 spells, 1 lvl 3 spell and 1 lvl 4 spell. With 29 Pally levels, you'll have 4 lvl 1 spells, 4 lvl 2 spells, 3 lvl 3 spells, and 3 lvl 4 spells. The side effect that in the end won't matter is that you'll lose the Monk skill dump at lvl 22 (and deflect arrows which is useless), but with Expertise and Divine Shield, that will hardly be a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is how it'd look like:<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladin(29), Champion of Torm(10), Monk(1), Human<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 15 (18)<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 8<br/>\nWIS: 14<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 16 (26)<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Paladin(1): Expertise, Power Attack<br/>\n02: Paladin(2): {Smite Evil}<br/>\n03: Paladin(3): Divine Shield<br/>\n04: Paladin(4): CHA+1, (CHA=17)<br/>\n05: Paladin(5)<br/>\n06: Paladin(6): Divine Might<br/>\n07: Paladin(7)<br/>\n08: Paladin(8): CHA+1, (CHA=18)<br/>\n09: Paladin(9): Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br/>\n10: Paladin(10)<br/>\n11: Paladin(11)<br/>\n12: Paladin(12): CHA+1, Improved Critical: Scimitar, (CHA=19)<br/>\n13: Paladin(13)<br/>\n14: Paladin(14)<br/>\n15: Paladin(15): Extra Smiting<br/>\n16: Paladin(16): CHA+1, (CHA=20)<br/>\n17: Paladin(17)<br/>\n18: Paladin(18): Blind Fight<br/>\n19: Paladin(19)<br/>\n20: Paladin(20): CHA+1, (CHA=21)<br/>\n21: Paladin(21): Great Charisma I, (CHA=22)<br/>\n22: Paladin(22)<br/>\n23: Paladin(23): Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br/>\n24: Champion of Torm(1): CHA+1, Great Charisma II, (CHA=24)<br/>\n25: Champion of Torm(2): Epic Prowess<br/>\n26: Paladin(24)<br/>\n27: Paladin(25): Great Charisma III, (CHA=25)<br/>\n28: Paladin(26): STR+1, Great Smite I, (STR=16)<br/>\n29: Champion of Torm(3)<br/>\n30: Champion of Torm(4): Great Smite II, Great Smite III<br/>\n31: Champion of Torm(5)<br/>\n32: Champion of Torm(6): STR+1, Great Smite IV, (STR=17)<br/>\n33: Champion of Torm(7): Great Smite V<br/>\n34: Champion of Torm(8): Great Smite VI<br/>\n35: Champion of Torm(9)<br/>\n36: Champion of Torm(10): STR+1, Great Smite VII, Great Smite VIII, (STR=18)<br/>\n37: Monk(1): {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}<br/>\n38: Paladin(27)<br/>\n39: Paladin(28): Great Smite IX<br/>\n40: Paladin(29): CHA+1, Great Smite X, (CHA=26)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 358<br/>\nSkillpoints: 217<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 34/31/28<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +1<br/>\nBAB: 30<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 38 (melee), 30 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 19/28<br/>\nSpell Casting: Paladin(4)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nConcentration 43(42), Discipline 43(47), Listen 40(42), Open Lock 1(0), Spellcraft 3(5), Taunt 43(51), Tumble 40(39)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Concentration(4), Discipline(4), Open Lock(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(4), Save(4), <br/>\n02: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(6), <br/>\n03: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(8), <br/>\n04: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(10), <br/>\n05: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(12), <br/>\n06: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(14), <br/>\n07: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(16), <br/>\n08: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(18), <br/>\n09: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(20), <br/>\n10: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(22), <br/>\n11: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(24), <br/>\n12: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(26), <br/>\n13: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(28), <br/>\n14: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(30), <br/>\n15: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(32), <br/>\n16: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(34), <br/>\n17: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(36), <br/>\n18: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(38), <br/>\n19: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(40), <br/>\n20: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(42), <br/>\n21: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(44), <br/>\n22: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(46), <br/>\n23: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(48), <br/>\n24: Discipline(1), Save(52), <br/>\n25: Discipline(1), Save(56), <br/>\n26: Concentration(3), Discipline(1), Taunt(3), Save(54), <br/>\n27: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(56), <br/>\n28: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(58), <br/>\n29: Discipline(1), Save(62), <br/>\n30: Discipline(1), Save(66), <br/>\n31: Discipline(1), Save(70), <br/>\n32: Discipline(1), Save(74), <br/>\n33: Discipline(1), Save(78), <br/>\n34: Discipline(1), Save(82), <br/>\n35: Discipline(1), Save(86), <br/>\n36: Discipline(1), Save(90), <br/>\n37: Concentration(9), Discipline(1), Listen(40), Tumble(40), Save(7), <br/>\n38: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(10), <br/>\n39: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), <br/>\n40: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), <br/>\n<br/>\nCompared to your build, this one would have +1 AB and damage, +1 level count towards Smiting damage (+11 damage on smites, 22 on criticals), - 8 to all saves, -38 HP, Full Concentration, 40 Listen and 1 Open Locks (just so you can use thieves tools and take advantage of the Bard Song), +2 lvl 3 spells a day, +2 lvl 4 spells a day, +1 lvl 1 and +1 lvl 2 spells a day. <br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to add that a MAXIMUM DC for a spell is 48 (for Implosion, which has an innate +3 to DC, cast by a 38 WISDOM Cleric with CAPPED WISDOM and ALL 3 SPELL FOCUS FEATS in Evocation). Now, arcane spells would have a MAX DC of 45. This build here has 40 FORT save, with Capped CHA, so with a Ring of Resistance +5, you'd already guarantee success against all arcane spells cast by even the most proficient mage with the best of gear. Most spells won't have such high DCs, so you don't need to have such high saves. It's surely nice, but Autofail is pretty much the only situation in which this build would fall to a spell, except in the very specific situation of a non-smitable dedicated caster followed by an unlucky roll. I would rather die in these situations and have the extra spells for all others. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that you sort of give up some things that are more or less in excess, although nice to have (KD, saves), to attain other much more useful things, such as spells per day, more smite damage, undispellability (which can be invaluable in many worlds). <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

You have to explain why it is considered only a \"nice to have\", for me to realize I am wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nUpdate: I have to admit, Expertise has its power too, its a tough choice between the two.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, in your build you should have taken 1 lvl of CoT pre-epic, this will give you +1Fort +2 Reflex at no cost.</div></blockquote>\n\nWell, I did that, thanks for suggesting. <br/>\n<br/>\nNormally when I approach hostile spellcasters, I do so invisible and take them by surprise. Using consumables is very important in NWN so all my meleers have Invisibility potions. That way, you attack them first and with the damage (likely lots of criticals per round), they won't be able to fire off spells, which is kind of like a KD. But where I play, not many mobs have True Seeing, so that can be done. If where you play they normally have True Seeing, then KD becomes invaluable, but then again if KD immunities are available, it becomes useless, so I guess it all depends where you play. I normally just come in invisible and attack the caster with everything I have. If there is more than one caster, you will probably have to smite one and then go right after the other (or run like hell and come back later). Either way, that's why I don't consider KD essential. With my style, the casters normally go down before they can fire off a single spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div></blockquote></div>"

May I suggest you use my build with the alterations you suggested then, as being dispellable will really hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnswering you question, Listen will allow you to \"see through walls\", while to use spot you need a direct line of sight between you and your target. If you don't have listen as a class skill in your build, then go for spot, but otherwise, sticking with Listen is IMO better cuz you can \"see\" your targets without them being able to see you as long as they don't have listen as well <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"
