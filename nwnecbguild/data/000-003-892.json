In those threads, Cornflower wrote:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><div>End-game bosses have somewhere around 85AC and 100AB, as well as occasionally stuff like OnHit Harm, OnHit Dispel and are usually plentiful. Usually they are also equipped with lots of Damage Reductions, so they take all day to kill. The only way to clear up end-game areas is a team of one WM-killer and one DD-tank.</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote><div>It's not enough to just hit on 20, because the bosses will regenerate faster than you hit them. The obvious solution is to have one WM-hitter and one DD-tank working together...</div></blockquote>\nI recently started playing on the same PW, and I'm interested in these specialist builds (especially the DD-tank). In other words, this is a request for: (1) a Dwarven Defender build that specializes in defense, designed specifically to work in a party with at least one offensive character in order to defeat the endgame bosses on this PW, and (2) a Weapon Master build that specializes in offense, designed to work in the DD character in the same party. Cornflower has provided further details about this particular PW in the threads linked above (and is much more familiar with the PW than I am, since I'm new there).<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also curious about how the characters in this party would work together in practice. For example, how does the DD-tank ensure that the boss is always hitting him instead of one-shotting the glass-cannon WM-killer? (In other games, this would be a question about how the \"threat\" or \"aggro\" mechanic works.)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Andariel will get hit less, but it will hurt more. A decent DwD will probably get hit more often, but can shrug more of it off. In the meantime, while the boss is wailing away on a stubborn dwarf, you've got a highly effective elven archer knocking chunks out of them. If both tank and killer are doing their job (remembering that the tank's main focus is to distract and occupy the attention of the enemy) then all is well. Haste is potentially useful, so long as you don't give the boss a clear run at your sniper while you're legging it. Alternatively, Defensive Stance and toe-to-toe might work. A DwD with a massive pool of HPs and EDRIII might just shrug and growl, \"And?\"<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I wonder if she could hit well, though?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Could be just toolset-increased AB. If so, this could fly. I'll try to find out.<br/>\nEither way, it would be the perfectly annoying toon to just walk around with and let everyone hit themselves tired on.... Seems like fun, I think I have a +20 Keen Scythe laying around somewhere. :-)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
