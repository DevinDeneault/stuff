Base AB 39 combined with the great defensive power should be enough to go solo with this guy, although more is always desirable. With Str capped (+6 AB), Bless/Aid pots (+2) and a +5 weapon, the AB hits 52. I chose Scythe from a thematic point of view and to do a bit of Str damage when its capped close to 40.<br/>\n<br/>\nI put improved disarm in the build for situational AB buffs against those pesky rogue types for a further +8 AB against tiny weapon wielders, +4 AB against small weapon wielders, and no penalties against medium weapon wielders. Also if you do actually disarm them, then they probably aren't going to do much damage against you with your EDR III, inability to sneak/crit you, and damage reduction against fire/acid/cold/electricity, not to mention if you have ghostly visage/ethereal visage up and they aren't a monk.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nA level 6 wizard spell book with 36 spells / day plus scribe scroll/craft wand is also handy, you get to wield the flaming scythe of death from level 4 with flame weapon, and sharpen the scythe with Keen edge at level 6!\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nTraps are going to be a pain without evasion or a significant disable trap skill, but with the find trap spell, and some points in search I've tried to manage this the best I could.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nHe can set some traps too if desired, simply cap dexterity for set trap 15 to set deadly fire/electrical/tangle traps (or cast one with the land from a scroll for +4 if you can - I think wizards can do this with some scrolls).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span class=\"inline-attachment\">\n<dl class=\"fileimage display\">\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/202001/10759084_fb8df57aeb8670547e185965f72b28ad_t.png\" />\n</dl>\n</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:50%;line-height:normal\">Image source:\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://i.redd.it/ydxxsqc62r831.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.redd.it/ydxxsqc62r831.png</a></span><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe caster level of 6 is not the best, however its kind of a bonus rather than a necessity to do the task required.\u00a0 Hence I haven't invested in any metamagic feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, with craft wand at level 21, if you get dispelled you can recast your improved invisibility, or haste with ease.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr make a few Fireball and ILMS wands for a bit of fun against non-spell resistant types.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd the dwarven beard / dark vision / Cha 6, and this guy will try to impersonate a full plate equipped Grim Reaper the best he can.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr an unstoppable tractor motoring along with a whirling scythe of death.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Design notes</strong><br/>\nWhen preparing this a Fighter 20/Bard 4/PM 16 could get a base AB of 40 with EDR III but I traded the 1 AB, tumble as class skill for the level 6 wizard spell book + craft wand, I thought it would be more fun to play shooting fireballs and ILMS from a wand, crafting lesser spell breach wands or scribing Tensor's Transformation scrolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheres a handful of high fighter/PMs in the archives (ie fighter 16+ PM 15+).
