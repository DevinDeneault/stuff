At some point I noticed that there was a counter on the icon, as if the number of uses per day were not infinite. It must have appeared at some point, it definitely is not there when I rest, and only appears after several uses. Anyone knows what's going on? Might be a WoG thing as the ability is changed there, but I thought only in duration. <i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
