You can put better portraits into your game by adding them manually for free.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkness Over Daggerford and Tyrants of the Moonsea are totally worth playing; I really enjoyed them. I can't remember exactly how high you can level but I think it's around 16-17 for DOD and around 20 for TOTMS.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started DDoF but I couldn't really get into it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to level up higher there are lots of player-made modules that are outstanding. Check out the ones discussed in this section of the forum.
