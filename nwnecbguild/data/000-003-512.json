      "content": "<div>Hi, Mighty Community. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm here again to take some advice from you. Here is another old idea but with new colors. Main purpose was to make DW-ing assasin with HiPS and Dev. Crit. (yeah, I know, I want to much from it, but, since it's possible... you know...)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, there are all initiative feats, Ambi/TWF/ITWF, Power attack/Cleave/Gr.Cleave/Overwh.Crit./Dev.Crit feats. Kukris are taken to increase threat range to 12-20 (x2)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what you think, guys?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Assassin(21), Fighter(16), Shadowdancer(3), Human, Any Evil</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 16 (28)<br/>\nDEX: 15<br/>\nCON: 14<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Fighter(1): Blooded, Dodge, Mobility<br/>\n02: Fighter(2): Weapon Proficiency Exotic<br/>\n03: Fighter(3): Weapon Focus: Kukri<br/>\n04: Fighter(4): STR+1, Weapon Specialization: Kukri, (STR=17)<br/>\n05: Fighter(5)<br/>\n06: Fighter(6): Two-Weapon Fighting, Ambidexterity<br/>\n07: Fighter(7)<br/>\n08: Fighter(8): STR+1, Power Attack, (STR=18)<br/>\n09: Fighter(9): Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br/>\n10: Fighter(10): Cleave<br/>\n11: Fighter(11)<br/>\n12: Fighter(12): STR+1, Great Cleave, Improved Critical: Kukri, (STR=19)<br/>\n13: Fighter(13)<br/>\n14: Assassin(1)<br/>\n15: Shadowdancer(1)*: Stealthy, {Hide in Plain Sight}<br/>\n16: Shadowdancer(2)*: STR+1, {Darkvision, Evasion, Uncanny Dodge I}, (STR=20)<br/>\n17: Shadowdancer(3)*<br/>\n18: Assassin(2): Improved Initiative<br/>\n19: Fighter(14): Knockdown<br/>\n20: Fighter(15): STR+1, (STR=21)<br/>\n21: Assassin(3): Great Strength I, (STR=22)<br/>\n22: Assassin(4)<br/>\n23: Assassin(5)<br/>\n24: Assassin(6): STR+1, Overwhelming Critical: Kukri, (STR=23)<br/>\n25: Assassin(7)<br/>\n26: Assassin(8)<br/>\n27: Assassin(9): Great Strength II, (STR=24)<br/>\n28: Assassin(10): STR+1, (STR=25)<br/>\n29: Assassin(11)<br/>\n30: Assassin(12): Devastating Critical: Kukri<br/>\n31: Assassin(13)<br/>\n32: Assassin(14): STR+1, Superior Initiative, (STR=26)<br/>\n33: Assassin(15): Epic Weapon Focus: Kukri<br/>\n34: Assassin(16)<br/>\n35: Assassin(17)<br/>\n36: Assassin(18): STR+1, Epic Skill Focus: Move Silently, Epic Skill Focus: Hide, (STR=27)<br/>\n37: Assassin(19)<br/>\n38: Assassin(20)<br/>\n39: Fighter(16): Armor Skin, Epic Weapon Specialization: Kukri<br/>\n40: Assassin(21): STR+1, (STR=28)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 390<br/>\nSkillpoints: 269<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 22/15/23<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Traps: +2, Poison: +6<br/>\nBAB: 28<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 40 (melee), 30 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 22/32<br/>\nSpell Casting: <br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nDisable Trap 16(20), Discipline 42(51), Hide 43(57), Move Silently 43(57), Open Lock 18(20), Pick Pocket 4(6), Set Trap 6(10), Tumble 40(42), UMD 41(40)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Discipline(4), Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Save(8)<br/>\n02: Discipline(1), Save(12)<br/>\n03: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(12)<br/>\n04: Discipline(1), Save(16)<br/>\n05: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(16)<br/>\n06: Discipline(1), Save(20)<br/>\n07: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(20)<br/>\n08: Discipline(1), Save(24)<br/>\n09: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(24)<br/>\n10: Discipline(1), Save(28)<br/>\n11: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(28)<br/>\n12: Discipline(1), Save(32)<br/>\n13: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(32)<br/>\n14: Hide(9), Move Silently(9), Tumble(15), UMD(6)<br/>\n15: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(7)<br/>\n16: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(14)<br/>\n17: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(5), Save(16)<br/>\n18: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), UMD(15), Save(6)<br/>\n19: Discipline(6), Save(5)<br/>\n20: Discipline(1), Save(9)<br/>\n21: Disable Trap(5), Hide(3), Move Silently(3), Set Trap(5)<br/>\n22: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(5)<br/>\n23: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), UMD(5)<br/>\n24: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(1), Pick Pocket(4)<br/>\n25: Disable Trap(5), Hide(1), Move Silently(1)<br/>\n26: Disable Trap(4), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(1)<br/>\n27: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(5)<br/>\n28: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), UMD(5)<br/>\n29: Disable Trap(2), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(3)<br/>\n30: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(5)<br/>\n31: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(5)<br/>\n32: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(5)<br/>\n33: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), UMD(5)<br/>\n34: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(5)<br/>\n35: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(10)<br/>\n36: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(15)<br/>\n37: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(5), Save(15)<br/>\n38: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), UMD(5), Save(15)<br/>\n39: Discipline(19), Save(1)<br/>\n40: Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Open Lock(4)<br/>\n<br/>\n* I take 3 SD levels because of my PW settings, which allows HiPS on 3rd SD level</div>"

      "content": "<div>D'alessandro, you REALLY need to start working your spreads better. Like, the idea is really good, but you just pick random numbers of levels to toss at each class for no reason. You did the same thing on your last build request with 18 PM, 6 BG etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nTo optimize a build, you need to get as much benefit as you can from each possible class combination. Why 21 Assassin? Why 3 SD? Those are the questions you need to ask yourself when building. If you want Shadowdancer only for HiPS, then 1 level is all you need. Unless 3 levels is a server restriction, in which case you should inform that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow Assassins get 1 Bonus Feat every 4 levels after 10, and also, you need AS MANY levels as you can possibly afford for higher Death Attack DC. You can drop Improved Initiative and Stealthy and drop Fighter to 12, maybe rearranging your feats and delaying the twf line of feats a bit. That frees up four levels, and going SD 1 frees up another two to take in Assassin. You could leave the SD to be taken at level 21, Going Fighter 11 Assassin 9 or Fighter 10 Assassin 10 pre-epic and getting Improved Invisibility as soon as possible. Your spread could be Fighter 12 assassin 27 SD 1 at the cost of 1 BAB and 2 feats. Or you can use the much more optimized spread that Kail and Mick have suggested. <br/>\n<br/>\nImproved Initiative is good, but you are going for DevCrit and TWF on a SD build (which requires 2 feats), so that already takes up a lot of feats. You could also relinquish some damage and go Ranger instead of Fighter. Ranger 9 SD 1 Assassin 30 will have a much higher DA DC, but you would need to wear light armor, so your AC would be jeopardized a bit. The advantage there is that Rangers get Hide and Move Silently as a class skill, so you can start gaining assassin benefits earlier. They gain the TWF feats for free as long as they don't wear medium or heavy armor and ITWF at lvl 9. You'd also lose WS and EWS and probably need to drop a couple of combat feats as well. Your BAB would also be lower due to the fact that your pre-epic spread would have to be Ranger 9 SD 1 Assassin 10, which accounts for 16 pre-epic BAB.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, think more about optimizing your spreads when you build, it will increase the quality of your builds tenfold! <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also some more specific tweaks like delaying dodge and mobility for PA and cleave so you can kill things faster early on. You can take Dodge and Mobility just before taking the SD level, as the only reason you are taking them is that they are requirements.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll take another look at it later on and let's see what you think of these comments first.

Well, I can drop WP:exotic and go with shortswords, having 30% chance to score a critical hit instead of 45% with kukri, but, with assasin, you need to score as much DA's &amp; DC's, as you can in first flurry, so it will hurt a little. Stealthy and ESF:hide/move also are important, cause this char want to hips while wearing heavy armor. KD is also must have, it's lot easier to score those DA's when your opponent is prone. I think you get my point of view. 16 fighters level are a needed minimum here. One thing i think about to drop is all those initiative feats. Since i will have HiPS, I will attack first always, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, with ranger it's possible to wear light armor while fighting with those non-immune to sneak and criticals opponents, and with undeads/constructs just wear full plate/tower shield, but this is not this toon's way, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. oh, I find a little mistake in my build, 4 skillpoints in Search instead of Pick Pocket )</div>"
