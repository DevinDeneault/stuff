Having read a lot of what has been written here and in the WOG board I am somewhat confused as to what build to try first. I do expect to take a few dirt maps as I explore but I don't want to invest time in a build that is basically pants.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat builds would you guys recommend to try first?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If I name a build (from the ECB, for example), can you yourself locate it and adapt it to WoG?

That said, unless otherwise specified, the majority of the finalized builds here should be relatively easy to adapt to the WoG environment. I do know that WoG has some of its own modifications and so on, but others will know them better than I.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and to add to Web's questions, are you planning to travel in party or to attempt solo?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

different build since he focuses on Discipline to go toe to toe with strength builds.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And then there is my own slew of Fighter/Rogue/CoT\u2019s: Death\u2019s Rival, The Last Great Bounty Hunter, and the Incredible Fighting Rogue of War, but they\u2019re all Dwarves, so\u2026 I won\u2019t bother posting links for those.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nBuilder\u2019s Commentary<br/>\nWhile I hesitate to call anything the \u201cquintessential\u201d build of something, this is fairly close to being one to represent the halfling rogue warrior clan.\u00a0 There are many varied combinations of these classes \u2013 a testament to the versatility of this combo \u2013 but somehow this one manages to be different.\u00a0 Of course, when you play this game long enough at some point you feel like you\u2019re \u201cjumping the shark\u201d when building any kind of class combo anymore.\u00a0 Many (me included) will often argue the value and investment of something like Self Concealment V since it is such a huge investment \u2013 5 feats \u2013 and coming at the expense of other things that you would like to see your Rogue have (Epic Will, Slippery Mind, Epic Fort, Great Dex\u2019s, Improved Sneaks or Epic Skill Foci).\u00a0 Indeed, I remade this same character and removed the SC feats and achieved an unbuffed dualwielding AB of 44, which is outstanding for no WM or RDD levels while still retaining 24 Rogue levels. <br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nBut there is still something sexy about SC V.\u00a0 It\u2019s baked in.\u00a0 It\u2019s permanent.\u00a0 There\u2019s no mitigation for it (save Blindfighting).\u00a0 If the enemy\u2019s first attack is an IKD, and he lands the hit, Epic Dodge makes it miss.\u00a0 His second attack is now coming at 5 lower AB, which is like adding 5 to your AC.\u00a0 Assuming he can still land that, Self Concealment takes over and now his hit is half as likely to miss.\u00a0 Epic Dodge, coupled with high AC and SC feats, makes you nigh untouchable. <br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nKukri\u2019s were taken because they\u2019re far sexier than daggers, and they can be keened and have a higher crit range.\u00a0 However, Improved Crit is not taken because of the diminishing return on that investment.\u00a0 Still, you could drop Called Shot, or Iron Will, if you feel you must have it.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think it adds much in a build like this.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nI rarely take Called Shot in a non-archer build, but it works in this one.\u00a0 It\u2019s a nice tool to have for both ranged and melee tactics, especially of the enemy is either to large to knockdown or has immunity/discipline resistance. <br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nWhile I invested points in Discipline, you may find yourself not needing it and rely on Epic Dodge and Concealment (and KD Immunity) to avoid the best attack sequence from your enemies.\u00a0 If you\u2019re swarmed by more than two opponents with such attacks, you may reconsider that decision though.\u00a0 Just know that enemies with Disarm/Improved Disarm may have a leg up on you, especially if they\u2019re using medium or large weapons.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nSpellcraft was cross-classed (yes, you have that many skill points) to help out in the saves department (+4 extra against spells).<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nFinally, there is something satisfying in how well the build matures.\u00a0 It gradually and consistently becomes stronger, faster, better, and never seems to lack.\u00a0 In fact, there is a sweet spot from Level 27 to Level 33 where, in a span of 6 levels, he grabs Epic Dodge, Crippling Strike, EWF, EWS, Epic Prowess, and SC I and SC II.\u00a0 I do miss the days when one could take Epic Dodge at Level 21, but those days are gone.\u00a0 Level 27 is as early as one can get it, and really should be the target one shoots for when building an Epic Dodger. </div></blockquote>\nI myself have played the build to level 40 on WoG, and I know that GDL has tested it there.\u00a0 The most important part of the build, imo (besides having ALL the skills and abilities necessary to survive on WoG all in a level 1-40 playable package) is the level 27 to 33 \"explosion\" of abilities built into the build that comes exactly when one will be needing them most!<br/>\nAll in all, a most enjoyable, incredible build, from the master builder himself, a known player of WoG.<br/>\nIt will not disappoint.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

This build is for all those PWs out there that have made happy adjustments to the Shadowdancer class. I\ufffdve played in several now where Shadow Evade has been given some actual use, and the duration is based on level, or have given Shadowdaze more teeth, or have altered the Shadowlord summons, and so on. Even if HiPS has been changed, given a cool-down period, or nerfed outright, this kind of character can still enjoy success. To explain the goal of this kind of character, it\ufffds simply to maximize the utilities of the Shadowdancer class while still maintaining a healthy melee presence. <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, we wanted an assassin-like character, except instead of using Death Attack, we use Dev Crit. We maximize SD levels to give us the most out of Shadow Evade and to grab that great DR it grants at higher levels, as well as that juicy Shadowdaze DC. Even in Full Plate this character will have the same steath score as if he were naked and dex-based with a 26 Dex. We use the the SD bonus feats in a way one not normally sees SD feats used\ufffdfor Epic Skill Focus feats. With 5 of those coming in Epic levels, there is lots of room for customization. Hide and Move Silently are a must, and the 3rd I nodded to the Epic Summons, and then I choose Taunt and Discipline because those things are important to me and my playstyle. I can easily see someone giving those up for Listen/Spot or UMD/Search, etc\ufffd.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\ufffdve done this kind of character before, such as in The Assassin King or the Zhentarim Field Agent, in which Strength-based stealthers launch from the shadows to lay waste with their sneak attacks. Since it hasn\ufffdt been done this way, I thought I\ufffdd post the full-blooded SD version. I\ufffdve done other versions that were also quite fun, and did a Halfling version (had to swap Rogue for Bard) that got an even better Stealth score. Dwarf also works well with this, but you have to give up 43 skill points. The non-Dev Crit version got a slightly better AB and finished with Improved Expertise and Improved Disarm, which may be a nice option if Dev Crit is banned on your server. If Shadowdancers haven\ufffdt been given incentives to go deeper into levels on your PW, then this build may not be for you, though would still be playable and unique.<br/>\n<br/>\nHalberd was chosen for coolness factor, though admittedly Greatsword would be better for crit efficiency. What\ufffds nice about the Halberd is that it does to damage types, and 1.69 finally got that 2 damage type bug fixed. Comments and flames welcome. Cheers.</div></blockquote><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I confess, I'd probably lose Stealthy for Knockdown, but that's just me (you know what late converts are like - I was never concerned with taking KD until about 3 or 4 years ago). In any case, it's a damn fine build regardless of environment, but I concede that it will flourish more in a WoG-type one.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for dropping it in!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
