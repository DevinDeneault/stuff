      "content": "<div>Hello all !<br/>\n<br/>\nI apologise if this has been asked before and it likely has (but I could not find it), but I have a question regarding \"The Unbreakable build\" - Stagmeisters build I think ?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it worth switching lightning reflexes / great fortitude for power attack/ cleave even though there is no dev crit where I play, it seems like cleave could be worth it even with low AB?<br/>\n<br/>\nOr am I \"better off\" taking iron will due to the horrible will saves?<br/>\n<br/>\nMuchos gracias !<br/>\nKoO<br/>\n<br/>\nPS I am loving this build<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE UNBREAKABLE\u00a0--\u00a0(FTR 10/ ROG 4/ DD 26)<br/>\n<br/>\nRACE: DWARF<br/>\nALIGNMENT:\u00a0Any Lawful,\u00a0LN (Smite proof)\u00a0recommended<br/>\nPLAYABILITY: PvM 1 \u2013 40<br/>\n<br/>\nSTARTING/ ENDING STATS:<br/>\nSTR -\u00a0 16 (28)<br/>\nDEX -\u00a0 13<br/>\nCON - 18 (22)<br/>\nINT -\u00a0\u00a0 13<br/>\nWIS -\u00a0 08<br/>\nCHA - 06<br/>\n<br/>\nDR: 27/ \u2013<br/>\n<br/>\nHit Points: 716<br/>\nSkill Points: 171\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscipline: 43 (52)<br/>\nTumble: 40 (41)<br/>\nSpellcraft: 19 (20) cc<br/>\nSet Traps: 14 (15)<br/>\nUMD: 36 (34)\u00a0</div>"

I have been reading (and trying be better at) realising that sometimes passive abilities (+'s to saves) are better than active abilities in some cases and was just curious. Looking back at it, I actually don't think the addition of power attack is that huge as the build is very strong anyway and the +2 saves are likely to be \"worth more\" in the long run that an occasional extra attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs always though I appreciate your inputs. I remember a long time ago someone explaining how a +2 save makes a huge difference\u00a0 in the grand scheme of things, i wish I had the article as it \"Mathhammered\" it quite well for simpletons like me haha !<br/>\nThanks again !<br/>\nKoO's</div>"
