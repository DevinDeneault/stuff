      "content": "<div>OK. I was so desperate for a build that could survive on Blackstone, which is a very strange place where the builds that work elsewhere is no good, that I thought, well, what if... So, on BSK, DR is king. AC is useless against bosses with 100AB. You don't need high AB either, since most bosses you can hit with 60-65 AB which is easily reached since you can forge a weapon with +20AB. So I kinda went all out with the cheeziest build I could come up with. I now post it here with great trepidation, awaiting the execution with trembling hands. Despite my fears, I ask you all for feedback. This is like my second build ever....<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, some more background.<br/>\nAs posted above, DR is king. Epic Dodge is also important, since it will make you survive at least twice as many attacks as without it. Lots of attacks is useful since most bosses have tons of immunities and various DR. You want something that makes divine or magical damage with high DPS. Basically, you have an uber weapon that rolls 400 points on a crit being useless, but a kama with d6 divine damage is the dream weapon. Also, you need Vamp Regen, unless you want to spend all your time making scrolls with Greater Sanctuary and Greater Restoration (Heal potions are extremely rare). UMD is a must. You can add 25% slash/pierc/bludg damage to any robe. Soak is useless, since all bosses have +10 weaponry at least and soak is maxed at 10 soak 10. You can add +4 STR or similar to any item if you can afford it. You can add +1 regen to any item not a weapon. You can add +2 universal saves to any item not a weapon. You can add divine d6 to any weapon. There are Greater Magic Bags available for carrying stuff. Etc, etc....<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, basically, I just focussed on what works on all my toons and combined it in one build. Now, when posting feedback, please consider the background above. Also, I have a thing about Heal/Lore/Appraise and I'm sure everone else would do something else with their skill points. (I don't do PvP, so no need for Taunt, Spot, etc. There are no need on BSK for Search, Traps and such either.)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, I forgot, the main purpose for this toon is to be able to solo high-level quest areas and maybe even visit some of the boss/raid areas alone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Monk(1), Rogue(13), Dwarven Defender(26), Dwarf\nSTR: 12\nCON: 18 (22)\nINT: 12\n\n01: Rogue(1): Dodge\n03: Rogue(2): Weapon Finesse\n05: Rogue(4)\n07: Rogue(6)\n09: Rogue(8): Toughness\n11: Rogue(10): Improved Evasion\n13: Dwarven Defender(2): {Defensive Awareness I}\n15: Dwarven Defender(4): Improved Critical: Kama\n17: Dwarven Defender(6)\n19: Rogue(11)\n21: Dwarven Defender(8): Great Dexterity I, (DEX=20)\n23: Dwarven Defender(10)\n25: Dwarven Defender(12)\n27: Dwarven Defender(14): Great Dexterity III, Epic Damage Reduction I, (DEX=22)\n29: Dwarven Defender(16)\n31: Dwarven Defender(18): Epic Damage Reduction II\n33: Dwarven Defender(20): Great Dexterity V, (DEX=26)\n35: Dwarven Defender(22): Epic Damage Reduction III\n37: Dwarven Defender(24)\n39: Rogue(13): Epic Dodge, Defensive Roll\n\nSkillpoints: 227\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +6, Traps: +3, Poison: +2\nAB (max, naked): 35 (melee), 35 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: \n\n\n01: Appraise(4), Heal(4), Lore(4), Spellcraft(2), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(12), \n03: Heal(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(2), Save(11), \n05: Heal(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(19), \n07: Heal(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(27), \n09: Heal(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(35), \n11: Heal(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(43), \n13: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(32), \n15: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(30), \n17: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(28), \n19: Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(8), UMD(8), Save(18), \n21: Discipline(3), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(21), \n23: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(21), \n25: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(21), \n27: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(21), \n29: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(23), \n31: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(25), \n33: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(27), \n35: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(29), \n37: Discipline(1), Save(33), \n39: Appraise(8), Tumble(17), UMD(19), \n\n</details></div>"

      "content": "<div>The Pale Sneaker is guaranteed a better tank than a Dwarven Defender against Bosses. And I love DDs. <br/>\nSuppose you have a Boss that we have 5 attacks (4+1 haste) &amp; awesome AB, okay?<br/>\nThe first successful attack will be automatically dodged, from the next four, half of them will hit thin air due to Self Concealment V (which cannot be breached/dispelled) &amp; then you have your superb AC for the remaining two attacks. Let's say that on average, the Boss will hit with 2/5 attacks per round. These attacks will still never crit you neither will gain any sneak bonus on you, they will always be normal attacks. And that's before gear comes into play with all the resistances &amp; whatnot. I simply cannot see how a DD will be better than this, except on the unique case of a specially designed Boss that hits with overwhelmingly powerful attacks &amp; you have low hit points. And also have its fists/claws count as +20 weapons, so the EW does not count (which I already suspect that is the case here). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe key against Bosses with AA's is to hit them with Called-Shot: Leg &amp; always move after the first burst-shots. Although, I suspect that the 100AB Boss might as well have 100 Discipline which will make that tactic moot. <br/>\nGood luck man!</div>"
