      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hello All,<br/>\n<br/>\nHerewith please find a fairly heavily re-worked and improved version of this adaptable dwarf.<br/>\n<br/>\nHarding has been played through a couple of SP environments: Aielund - with companions - and solo through Sou/HotU/ongoing in Sands of Fate. Poorly, on my part, I had until recently believed PvM to mean Player versus Machine, rather than Monster, thus thought all PvM builds were for soloists (D'oh). He does, fortunately, play well with others, but is equally happy working alone (sounds like a typical CV now). He's also very playable at all levels, and very good at staying alive - even solo he only died once in my playthroughs pre-epic, and that was my own dumb fault for confusing what he was already immune to with what he wasn't - flogging all my antidote pots when only immune to disease was not smart.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Changes and History</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nInitially a Monk 30/CoT 6/Fighter 4, with the 4 levels of Fighter taken pre-epic and the then 6 levels of CoT all in epic, I was more than happy to take on board suggestions for improvement - particulary in saves and improved WIS without sacrificing AB or AC - from, primarily HipRedux, through an intervention from the currently absent but no less worthy Tatooed Monk's Temple Guardian (Unarmed version). The initial design concept, fermenting in my grey matter while playing through a different Monk build in Aielund (Empyre's Order of the Wyrm: Unarmed version) seemed to then take on the other side of the debate between Valerfor and Maximillian Kane about the various merits/downsides to a build like this in Valerfor's Iron Fist Monk (Monk 35/Fighter 5) thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving mentioned Aielund, in that environment I would loose Great Fortitude, insert SkFocus:Discipline at L6, then Iron Will at 9 and LReflex at 18. I'd also drop Search skills to 6(9), improve Heal to 2(5) and insert 7 points of Concentration (10)\u00a0 early on in the schemata. That should be sufficient to avoid taunts early on, and avoid getting dropped on your arse all the time in Part 2. It's expedient, but doesn't radically alter the build (Fort saves drop to 33, which remains more than solid, and Disc improves to 46 (57)).<br/>\n<br/>\nDo please feel free to allocate the 21 skill points not in Discipline, Tumble or Spellcraft elsewhere in any given different environment/campaign. It might be worth noting that Harding, while STR-based, is not a Dev Crit build - which is only useable in some environments, while non-Dev Crit is useable everywhere. Oh, and the WF in Kama is only taken to access CoT, although there's nothing wrong with having some slashing capabilities!<br/>\n<br/>\nI've enjoyed playing him, and hope others will too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Harding Brightwater</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nMonk 26 / Champion of Torm 10 / Fighter 4<br/>\nDwarf - Lawful Non-evil<br/>\nL1-40 PvM<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Statistics</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nSTR 16 (32)<br/>\nDEX 14<br/>\nCON 16<br/>\nINT 10<br/>\nWIS 14 (16)<br/>\nCHA 6<br/>\n<br/>\nHit Points: 468<br/>\nSkill Points: 144<br/>\nSkills: Discipline 43 (54), Heal 1 (4), Search (x class) 10 (13), Spellcraft (x class) 20 (20), Tumble 40 (42)<br/>\nSaves (F/R/W): 35/34/32 (41/40/38 v Spells, Immune to Disease, Poison, Mind Effects)<br/>\nSR: 36<br/>\nDR: 20/+1<br/>\nSpeed +80%<br/>\nWholeness of Body: heal 52 HP/day<br/>\nEmpty Body: 50% concealment, 26 rounds/2xday<br/>\nAC (naked): 30 <strong><span style=\"color:#FF0000\">[full plate 10 +1dex +2as +8tum +8arm = 29 (32 w/tower)]</span></strong><br/>\n<br/>\nBAB: 26<br/>\nAB: Unarmed - 41/38/35/32/29/26 (+FoB), Ranged - 29<br/>\nDamage: 1xD20+17 (19-20 x2)<br/>\nStunning Fist DC:33, Quivering Palm DC:26<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Levelling Guide</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nDwarf (Darkvision / Def Trng vs Giants / Off Trng vs Bugbears, Gobs, HGobs, Orcs / Stonecunning / +2 saves vs poison and spells / +2 to Lore)<br/>\n1.

An alternative would have been to move Epic Prowess to level 40 and put the second EWF in at level 22, but the prime focus of the build remains unarmed attack, so I didn't want to delay that +1 AB.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks Both,<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Empyre - I'm a dipstick. You're right, of course. Skill Focus in Discipline might therefore be a better choice, given that the Fort save would still be strong enough without the extra 2 points. It was always about being able to function decently early on - much as taking Iron Will and the Concentration and Heal skills was<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Hip - the above point demonstrates what I'm trying to achieve with this build. I want him to stay alive, and preferably upright, during his adolescence. One thing I've noticed here, and it's probably to do with the great and good spending a lot of time at L40 or thereabouts in PWs (virtually the opposite of where I play), is that many builds are waek as dishwater pre-epic, certainly as far as defences are concerned. To that end, lots of pre-epic Monk helps immeasurably. 16 levels gives +3 AC, 50% speed increase and +10 to all saves, as well as SR of 26, and immunity to disease and poison. Even if I took all the CoT levels pre-epic it would only give +1 to AB, and the +3 to the saves are more than mitigated by the rest of the Monk's repetoire. If anything, I noticed a slackening off of durability between levels 22 and 26, and I'm not sure why. For me, the race is then on to get to Monk 20 for the immunity to mind effects and DR20 (admittedly only at +1, but meaning you can ignore most of the mundane attacks), with a passing hat-tip to L18 for the 50% concealment. Hence my decisions.<br/>\n<br/>\n However, I'm fairly flexible on the SR 44 question. At level 30 I'd have SR 40 anyway, and there are 2 Monk BFs at 25 and 30. I dismissed the idea of collecting a mere 2 more points, but was tempted by 4. Otherwise, those feats would have gone to Epic Energy Resistance. Those two bonus feats were, however, incidental. I wanted the additional +2AC, saves, additional +10SR and +30% speed that comes with Monk 30 over Monk 20. I don't believe I had any other viable alternatives as far as the feats go (Epic Toughness being a coward's way out, I believe), though I would be happy to be proved wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Should be +6, no?<br/>\n<br/>\n FYI (unless you are already aware)\u00a0 Tatooed Monk created his Temple Guardian mnk/ftr/cot in the legacy archive back in 2006 and includes both kama and unarmed versions which are nearly mirrors of the one you've posted.\u00a0 Unfortunately, he never followed up on why he chose to target such a high SR in either build so I am still confused since it sacrifices so much investing in those extra 10 levels of monk.\u00a0 Besides the SR, they gain 2 AC and cost +2 universal saves, 2 feats, and +2 AB (1BAB and +1AB).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n I'll ask the question once more.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">The +8 vs spells comes from the +4 from Spellcraft, +2 from Dwarf and +2 from Monk level 3. Admittedly, the latter is vs Mind Spells, and thus becomes redundant post L20 Monk, so I can rewrite to accommodate that.<br/>\n<br/>\n You mentioned Tatooed Monk's builds in another forum, but alas I couldn't find them. Sorry, I'm sure that's my fault somehow. I therefore have no insight as to his reasons for targeting high SR.<br/>\n<br/>\n For myself, I probably ought to clarify that I am not targeting high SR, it is a happy by-product of Monk, which simply feeds into the mix. Let me be clear, this is a build constructed to maximise natural defences, while being very capable in attack. I'm not looking for a specific mage-killer, in the same way that I'm not looking for an undead-hunter or dragon-slayer. I want a rounded build that won't just collapse at any given attack.<br/>\n<br/>\n I assume from your \"cost +2 universal saves, 2 feats\" line, that you're thinking about more CoT levels. Firstly, you're wrong about the saves, sorry. More CoT certainly does give the +2 (assuming 4 more levels), but Monk gives bonuses to all three saves every three levels, and with Will being the only one that might need addressing, that's an overall loss of 1, which I don't believe is an issue when set against the +2AC (admittedly +1 that dropping 4 levels would entail). Secondly, I'm not entirely sure what I'd beneficially do with those 2 extra feats. Happy to be enlightened.<br/>\n<br/>\n As to your iteration of minimum levels I was looking for at the outset (which, incidentally, I don't recall you asking before): min AB 26 (BAB 40); AC 30; SR 40.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm not entirely sure why you wish to disregard the speed factor, but I'll bow to experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers, Hip, thanks for the questions - they always make me think about why I did what I did!

Could take the Fighter levels pre-epic instead of CoT to get WS earlier, at the cost of slightly worse saves.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Unarmed<br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\n<br/>\n Here is the Unarmed version:<br/>\n<br/>\n Playable 1-40, PvM, light PvP<br/>\n<br/>\n Monk(30), Fighter(4), Champion of Torm(6), Dwarf<br/>\n STR: 16 (32)<br/>\n DEX: 14<br/>\n CON: 16<br/>\n WIS: 14<br/>\n INT: 10<br/>\n CHA: 6<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 500<br/>\n Skillpoints: 152<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 31/27/30 (+6 vs. spells)<br/>\n BAB: 26<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 41 (melee), 29 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 30/32<br/>\n SR = 44<br/>\n Discipline 43(54), Spellcraft 20(20), Tumble 40(42), 29 left over<br/>\n<br/>\n L01: M(1): Luck of Heros, M: (Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist)<br/>\n L02: M(2): M: (Deflect Arrows)<br/>\n L03: M(3): Weapon Focus: Unarmed<br/>\n L04: M(4): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n L05: M(5)<br/>\n L06: M(6): Dodge, M: (Knockdown, Improved Knockdown)<br/>\n L07: M(7)<br/>\n L08: M(8): STR+1, (STR=18)<br/>\n L09: M(9): Weapon Focus: Kama, M: (Improved Evasion)<br/>\n L10: M(10): M: (KI Strike +1)<br/>\n L11: M(11): M: (Diamond Soul)<br/>\n L12: M(12): STR+1, Toughness, M: (Diamond Body), (STR=19)<br/>\n L13: M(13): M: (KI Strike +2)<br/>\n L14: M(14)<br/>\n L15: M(15): Improved Critical: Unarmed<br/>\n L16: CT(1): STR+1, CT: (Lay on Hands), (STR=20)<br/>\n L17: M(16): M: (KI Strike +3)<br/>\n L18: CT(2): Power Attack, Great Cleave, CT: (Sacred Defense)<br/>\n L19: CT(3): CT: (Smite Evil)<br/>\n L20: CT(4): STR+1, Blind Fight, (STR=21)<br/>\n L21: F(1): Great Strength I, Epic Weapon Focus: Unarmed, (STR=22)<br/>\n L22: F(2): Epic Prowess<br/>\n L23: F(3)<br/>\n L24: F(4): STR+1, Weapon Specialization: Unarmed, Epic Weapon Specialization: Unarmed, (STR=23)<br/>\n L25: M(17)<br/>\n L26: M(18)<br/>\n L27: M(19): Great Strength II, (STR=24)<br/>\n L28: M(20): STR+1, (STR=25)<br/>\n L29: M(21)<br/>\n L30: M(22): Great Strength III, (STR=26)<br/>\n L31: M(23)<br/>\n L32: M(24): STR+1, (STR=27)<br/>\n L33: M(25): Great Strength IV, Improved Spell Resistance I, (STR=28)<br/>\n L34: M(26)<br/>\n L35: M(27)<br/>\n L36: M(28): STR+1, Great Strength V, (STR=30)<br/>\n L37: M(29)<br/>\n L38: M(30): Improved Spell Resistance II<br/>\n L39: CT(5): Great Strength VI, CT: (Divine Wrath), (STR=31)<br/>\n L40: CT(6): STR+1, Armor Skin, (STR=32)<br/>\n<br/>\n This version has more flexibility in terms of feats. Can really easily add Dev Crit - just drop Epic Prowess and move Armor Skin to replace one of the Improved SR's, and you've got it (move the 5th and 6th CoT levels up to take it at level 28). COsts you 2 AC and 2SR, or 2 Str if you drop Gr Str feats instead. If you don't want Dev Crit, you could also drop Power Attack and Great Cleave pre-epic for feats of your choice. You could also take the first CoT levels earlier if you want, I held off to reach Monk level 16 ASAP for unarmed damage. The build will also work as a human, for some more skill points and another feat (although you are not tight for feats on this one at all). This one gets a final SR of 44, not enough for a true mage-killer but more than adequate for PvM. If you want to specialize on mages or use it for PvP, I recommend dropping a few Gr. Str. feats for more Improved SR. You can also drop the last 2 CoT levels for Monk levels, effectively trading 2 AC from Armor Skin for 2 more SR. You can get SR up to 58, dropping Str to 26 and AC by 2.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n edit:\u00a0 BTW, CoT gains primary saves for Fort and Reflex PLUS the +2 universal saves (for 4 levels).\u00a0 Monk primary gains only the extra Will saves beyond the CoT primary. Trust me. More CoT will always surpass monk levels save-wise until CoT 10 is reached and then only half as effective (+1 saves per 4 CoT instead of 2 CoT).\u00a0 I'll show you EXACTLY what to do with those bonus feats. *lol*<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

First, on the numpty side, can I amend the title in a simple edit as normal or is there something special I need to do? Yes, I'm afraid I do still require that level of spoonfeeding. Don't know if you've ever encountered the 80s UK comedy, \"Blackadder\", but there's a line in its 3rd incarnation that goes, \"I'm quite happy to wear cotton, but have no idea how it works.\" That's pretty much me and IT.<br/>\n<br/>\n Secondly, I've done an eeny-weeny bit of tinkering (can't help myself), in light of Empyre's input re saves vs knockdown (which I knew, but stupidly forgot). Thus, Great Fortitude is needed less early on, and might actually be substituted by something else in the juggle (SkF:Discipline - in Aielund, Called Shot - as per your first suggestion, Mobility, PA, or even Toughness). I'm still working out the trade-offs.<br/>\n<br/>\n Finally, my skills distribution is inelegant (outside what I have in mind for Aielund, which is nice and simple), but I will explain why in the final posting.<br/>\n<br/>\n Probably should have kept this on the Unfinalized forum for now, eh?

I've just been looking to find the best place to do it rather than just being lazy and throwing it in at level 40 (although that still might end up being the best place, but it's worth thinking about first), when I had a moment of bafflement at my own build. How on earth did I manage to take Improved SR I at level 35 (Monk 23)? It's not a general feat level, nor does Monk 23 attract a bonus feat. Methinks I screwed up, so will need to edit that regardless!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> I've now edited the lead post to accommodate your suggestion, Valerfor (along with getting rid of that oddity at level 35). I ended up deciding that level 40 was indeed the best place for it - my reasoning being that the only 2 other options I thought might work would either i) mean dropping Epic Prowess down to 40, or ii) leave too wide a split between the taking of the two remaining Great Wisdoms for my liking.<br/>\nHope this meets with approval, and thanks for the thought!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
