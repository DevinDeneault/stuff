      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">It is well known (or at least, should be imo) that Divine Power (spell) gives BAB of a Fighter of the same Character level - and assuming one does not have the same BAB (and also, does not have 4 attacks/Round), that an extra attack will be generated at full AB (re: BAB) (the same is true for 1 attack and a fighter would get 2, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\nThus, it is often suggested in Cleric builds that have access to DP to make sure that one does not have more than 3 attacks/Round (and thus, gets a massive benefit from DP).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here is the question :<br/>\n<br/>\nIn regards to the properties of DP, wouldn't it be even more advantageous to only have 2 attacks a round?\u00a0 Yes, the second \"free\" attack that would be granted by DP is at the normal -5 BAB from Max, but it is still better than being a third, or fourth attack (-10.-15, accordingly).<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, getting only 2 attacks a round might be the tricky part as a Cleric, but surely it is possible?\u00a0 Perhaps a Cleric/PM style build?<br/>\n<br/>\nThis same will go for an environment that has altered Tenser's Transformation (the PnP equivalent), which acts like DP does for a Cleric, or one that has UMD and uses DP.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Yes, but such a build will have a very low AB. If the difference is between BAB 11 and 10, maybe that is a good idea, if it is between 15 and 10, probably no. Also keep in mind that if you have Haste and DP on, your schedule will be like 0/-5/-10/0/-5, and moving the -10 attack to the bonus attacks (by having 10 or less BAB) will change it to 0/-5/0/-5/-10. i.e. not change it at all.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
