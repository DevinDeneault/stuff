      "content": "<div>I suppose it depends on what is meant by damage immunity here, after all there are many types of damage, from the purely physical (slashing, bludgeoning, piercing, etc), through elemental (fire, cold, acid, etc), to the mental (mind spells, spell type, etc), and plenty more besides - including that sneaky way Implosion gets around death magic immunity.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid you check out the wiki's page on immunity?

If a character equips items that grants 200% damage immunity bonus, he would still be rendered 100% vulnerable if a 100% damage immunity effect is applied. This is in the previous version of NWN, can\u2019t test this in the current version without knowledge of the sources of this effect. I think its inclusion in the restoration spells\u2019 description is like a placeholder for when the game may expand to include such effects.</div>"

      "content": "<div>It seems there might be some confusion regarding the restoration line of spells and their interaction with damage immunities and vulnerabilities. The restoration spells, such as Lesser Restoration, Greater Restoration, and similar magic, are primarily focused on removing conditions and ailments affecting a creature, such as blindness, paralysis, or curses. While they can indeed remove penalties associated with damage immunities, it's important to note that these spells typically don't directly address vulnerabilities to damage types. Vulnerabilities to damage types, such as vulnerability to fire or vulnerability to radiant damage, are usually imposed by specific effects, abilities, or conditions within the game system. However, as of my last update, there isn't a direct spell effect or condition that grants vulnerabilities to damage types, and consequently, there wouldn't be a direct interaction with the restoration spells in removing such vulnerabilities. If such a mechanic were introduced in a specific game or edition, it would likely come with its own means of mitigation or removal, possibly through different spells or abilities.</div>"

      "content": "<div>The Restoration line of spells generally removes conditions like exhaustion and paralysis, but not direct damage vulnerabilities. Some powerful curses or magical effects might reduce a creature's immunity, which Restoration could potentially address. Check with your game master or specific rulebook for more details on these interactions.\u00a0</div>"
