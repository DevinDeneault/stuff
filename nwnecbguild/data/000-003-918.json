I wonder if there is someone familiar with Arelith mechanics who could help me with creating a good totem druid build. I would love to have some monk levels in it. My main question is should I go for dragon shape or maybe Epic Damage Reduction feats and what totem animal to choose.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you cant help me I understand that :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
