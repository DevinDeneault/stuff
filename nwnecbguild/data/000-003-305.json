You're going to be stretched for stats if you try to \"do it all\" as you'll need your attack stat, CON for rage and possibly EDR, and wisdom 14 to get full Paladin spell use (that's not even counting attempting to use CHA for Divine feats since dwarves get a penalty there) and it also means you'll be limited in skill points since you're not human, wont have a lot of stats to go around, and assuming you want more Paladin and DD than Barbarian that's a lot of 2pt/level class levels.  Also, I'd assume that alignment shifts aren't a problem since you have 2 classes that require lawful and 1 that can't be lawful.<br/>\n<br/>\n you basically showed up to a car dealer and said \"please build me a car\" without giving any criteria...try to narrow it down a bit.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Base HP around 630 or so with AB of 45 (710HP AB47 raging).<br/>\n<br/>\n Rage will be 3x/day for 1 turn each use.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'll leave you to figure saves and damage but I suggest either rapier or scimi as WoC for the most crit opps. \u00a0Vs. uber AC foes, you may want a higher base damage weapon if you so choose but with DevCrit you just want to stand there taking damage and swinging as often as possible waiting to crit.<br/>\n<br/>\n If this isn't what you are looking for you are going to need to document the most significant idiosyncrasies of your server or your own preferences in more detail. Without being participants on your server (at least I have never played there), the guild members are all pretty much in the dark as to what this build needs to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>edit: oops, corrected typo\u00a0&amp; furnished some more raging stats</em><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Not sure if that makes a difference</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">Naturally. \u00a0The build I furnished is one that will not be effective without DevCrit working. \u00a0Without it, crits are not an end-all like with killing blows, they just create more damage. \u00a0DevCrit DC means nothing now.<br/>\n<br/>\n There are several options without going the DevCrit route. \u00a0You also didn't mention whether this was intended for PvM or PvP so I'll assume PvP for now.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'd keep Power Attack but lose Cleave/Grt Cleave which are only useful in PvM and mainly when being flanked. Imp PA is needed instead. \u00a0You'll need to try to create as much damage as possible. \u00a0When you begin to face AC's beyond your capacity to hit them regularly (probably in the 65+ range), that's when to queue IPA mode. \u00a0Make that 5% count as much as possible. \u00a0If you find that your DR and HP soak are working well with a shield, you can explore chancing a 2-hand weapon like scythe that does x4 on crits. \u00a0But you'd need to refocus to take advantage, of course. \u00a0There should be room for Exotic proficiency if needed. Since you don't need BF at all, there's a spare feat pre-epic and another in epic. \u00a0In pre-epic, perhaps KD (or Exotic Prof as mentioned). \u00a0Mobility really does not get used with the way a DwD fights but is handy if you are displacing while in combat. It's a matter of combat style.<br/>\n<br/>\n Without OverCrit/DevCrit in epic, there's room for two more Grt Str (total of 7x). \u00a0Take them for extra damage &amp; AB (i.e. Str 17(34) ). \u00a0There are only 3 really useful bonus feats, Prowess, AS &amp; EWF. \u00a0I guess 2x Epic Toughness for the two others else 20/- for some energy resistance help (it stacks with other non-feat sources). \u00a0Your choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyhoo...<br/>\n<br/>\n Get in the habit of explaining in detail what you want in your request. \u00a0Include every possible factor that could affect how the toon will interact with the environment and/or \u00a0circumstance. Many guild members will not bother to reply to poorly-defined requests. \u00a0Believe it or not, we are all pressured by RL responsibilities, yet try to fit in a few moments to furnish some helpful advice when we can. \u00a0Please help make those moments efficient ones. \u00a0Thanks. \u00a0And good luck!</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
