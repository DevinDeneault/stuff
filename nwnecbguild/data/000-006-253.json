      "content": "<div>Hail ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\n I have always wondered what a Dwarf Cleric should be like. I thought of many versions of Battle Clerics, but what I really wanted was to combine DD and Cleric in a feasible way while going for the maximum possible Damage Reduction. Generally speaking, DDs have low AB because of the heavy CON investment, and this one is no exception. That's where the CLERIC buffs come in. They make this guy a very powerful meleer with a whopping 60 fully-buffed AB and 24/- points of damage reduction, most of which are attained by level 31 with the 3 EDR feats. The most challenging part of making this guy was figuring out the stats. 13 DEX for Dodge is required, 18 WIS to cast all spells is also a must,\u00a013 INT for Expertise (to save up Defensive Stances for important battles and also for some skill points) (no longer true after tweaks), 21 CON for the EDR feats and STR for AB and damage. Lots of stats, not enough points. GEEZ! But it all worked out in the end\u00a0and the result was not severely gimped!\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n I managed to keep BAB at 25 so that Divine Power grants that juicy extra attack at full BAB and picked the Warhammer because of the low STR modifier (no reason going 2-hander and losing AC to multiply a shitty STR modifier). It's better to wield a shield and work around in Expertise mode (no longer true after tweaks) to avoid getting hit until you start getting those EDR feats, which come somewhat later than in most DD builds. Also, Devcrit is not doable due to feat constraints and even if it was, low STR would make it not worth it. With Clerical buffs, you should have no problem hitting most mobs and your damage output should be OK as is with pretty much all Clerics, even in expertise. As always, knowing when to buff and when to just be patient and wait for enemies to die is crucial because you don't have a lot of spells nor do they last for very long. But they are enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n No similar builds in the Search Engine. Many Cleric / DD builds, but none manage to get such high DR and none go for Rogue. A few go with Monk,\u00a0two with CoT, one with Assassin and\u00a0one with Fighter. There is also our good old Empyre65 build which has no third class (Cleric 26 / DD 14). This guy is just more powerful than all of these simply because of UMD, Tumble AC and more DR. He is dispellable and he knows it, but good luck even making a dent in him. His domain choice is pretty set. you don't need concealment, and if you do, you'll need to get it through UMD, because STR domain gives you more Divine Powers (with few caster levels as is it's a MUST) and War gives you Aura of Vitality, which is also nice to have and makes you even harder to kill, raising your CON score by 4, for 80 HP (as if 682 HP weren't enough!) and you also have Endurance as an option for another boost.<br/>\n<br/>\n One of the coolest things (and a first time for me) is that you spend the first 14 levels without allocating a SINGLE SKILL POINT (EDIT: no longer true after tweaks). The reason for it is that they are quite tight. I could have started with Rogue at level 1, but that would just anticipate the XP penalty, which as is starts at level 19, for a few skill points that would barely make a difference. I'd rather not have XP penalty for 19 levels and have\u00a0one more Tumble dump, but if you feel u need a few more points, that tweak is available and will change nothing in the build concept (except make it harder to play :D)<br/>\n<br/>\n Ladies and Gents: the Dwarven Holy Wall!<br/>\n<br/>\n Cleric(15), Dwarven Defender(22), Rogue(3), Dwarf<br/>\n<br/>\n Alignment: Any Lawful<br/>\n<br/>\n Playability: 1-40 PvM<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 14 (20)<br/>\n DEX: 14<br/>\n CON: 16 (22)<br/>\n WIS: 15 (18)<br/>\n INT: 12<br/>\n CHA: 6<br/>\n<br/>\n Dwarf: (Darkvision, Defensive Training vs. Giants, Stonecunning, Hardiness vs. Poison, Hardiness vs. Spells, Offensive Training vs. Goblinoids, Offensive Training vs. Orcs, Skill Affinity: Lore)<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Cleric(1): Extend Spell, Domain Strength, Domain War<br/>\n 02: Cleric(2)<br/>\n 03: Cleric(3): Knockdown<br/>\n 04: Cleric(4): WIS+1, (WIS=16)<br/>\n 05: Cleric(5)<br/>\n 06: Cleric(6): Blind Fight<br/>\n 07: Cleric(7)<br/>\n 08: Cleric(8): WIS+1, (WIS=17)<br/>\n 09: Cleric(9): Craft Wand<br/>\n 10: Cleric(10)<br/>\n 11: Cleric(11)<br/>\n 12: Cleric(12): WIS+1, Dodge, (WIS=18)<br/>\n 13: Cleric(13)<br/>\n 14: Cleric(14)<br/>\n 15: Cleric(15): Toughness, {Defensive Stance}<br/>\n 16: Dwarven Defender(1):Cleric(15): CON+1, (CON=17)<br/>\n 17: Dwarven Defender(2): {Defensive Awareness I}<br/>\n 18: Dwarven Defender(3): Weapon Focus: Warhammer<br/>\n 19: Rogue(1)<br/>\n 20: Dwarven Defender(4): CON+1, (CON=18)<br/>\n 21: Dwarven Defender(5): Great Constitution I, (CON=19)<br/>\n 22: Dwarven Defender(6)<br/>\n 23: Dwarven Defender(7)<br/>\n 24: Dwarven Defender(8): CON+1, Great Constitution II, (CON=21)<br/>\n 25: Dwarven Defender(9)<br/>\n 26: Dwarven Defender(10)<br/>\n 27: Dwarven Defender(11): Epic Damage Reduction I<br/>\n 28: Dwarven Defender(12): STR+1, (STR=15)<br/>\n 29: Rogue(2): {Evasion}<br/>\n 30: Dwarven Defender(13): Epic Damage Reduction II<br/>\n 31: Dwarven Defender(14): Epic Damage Reduction III<br/>\n 32: Dwarven Defender(15): STR+1, (STR=16)<br/>\n 33: Dwarven Defender(16): Great Strength I, (STR=17)<br/>\n 34: Dwarven Defender(17)<br/>\n 35: Dwarven Defender(18): Epic Weapon Focus: Warhammer<br/>\n 36: Dwarven Defender(19): STR+1, Great Strength II, (STR=19)<br/>\n 37: Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br/>\n 38: Dwarven Defender(20)<br/>\n 39: Dwarven Defender(21): Great Strength III, (STR=20)<br/>\n 40: Dwarven Defender(22): CON+1, Epic Prowess, (CON=22)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 682<br/>\n Skillpoints: 147<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 29/27/19<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +2, Traps: +1, Poison: +2<br/>\n BAB: 25<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 34 (melee), 27 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 19/30<br/>\n Spell Casting: Cleric(8)<br/>\n Alignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\n Concentration 32(38), Discipline 43(48), Tumble 40(42), UMD 32(30)<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Concentration(4), Save(8),<br/>\n 02: Concentration(1), Save(10),<br/>\n 03: Concentration(1), Save(12),<br/>\n 04: Concentration(1), Save(14),<br/>\n 05: Concentration(1), Save(16),<br/>\n 06: Save(19),<br/>\n 07: Save(22),<br/>\n 08: Save(25),<br/>\n 09: Save(28),<br/>\n 10: Save(31),<br/>\n 11: Save(34),<br/>\n 12: Save(37),<br/>\n 13: Save(40),<br/>\n 14: Save(43),<br/>\n 15: Save(46),<br/>\n 16: Discipline(19), Save(30),<br/>\n 17: Discipline(1), Save(32),<br/>\n 18: Discipline(1), Save(34),<br/>\n 19: Tumble(20), UMD(22), Save(1),<br/>\n 20: Concentration(2), Discipline(2),<br/>\n 21: Concentration(2), Discipline(1),<br/>\n 22: Concentration(2), Discipline(1),<br/>\n 23: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Save(1),<br/>\n 24: Discipline(1), Save(3),<br/>\n 25: Discipline(1), Save(5),<br/>\n 26: Discipline(1), Save(7),<br/>\n 27: Discipline(1), Save(9),<br/>\n 28: Discipline(1), Save(11),<br/>\n 29: Tumble(10), UMD(10),<br/>\n 30: Concentration(1), Discipline(2),<br/>\n 31: Concentration(2), Discipline(1),<br/>\n 32: Concentration(2), Discipline(1),<br/>\n 33: Concentration(2), Discipline(1),<br/>\n 34: Concentration(2), Discipline(1),<br/>\n 35: Concentration(2), Discipline(1),<br/>\n 36: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Save(1),<br/>\n 37: Tumble(10),<br/>\n 38: Concentration(1), Discipline(2),<br/>\n 39: Concentration(2), Discipline(1),<br/>\n 40: Concentration(2), Discipline(1),<br/>\n<br/>\n So, what are your thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n EDIT: Tweaked the build a bit. No reason to delay Cleric 15. I was messing around with several starting stat possibilities, and the delaying of\u00a0Cleric was a residual effect of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n EDIT II: I tweaked the build according to Mick Dagger's suggestion. Expertise, which had been taken at level 15, was anticipated to lvl 9 and I moved the DD requirements to 12 and 15 respectively, changing nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\n EDIT III: Swapped Spot for Concentration\u00a0and removed\u00a01 point from open locks,\u00a0as per Valerfor's Suggestion. It's looking GOOD!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\n EDIT IV: Swapped Expertise for Craft Wands following Valerfor's suggestion. As I see it, Expertise is REALLY USEFUL for a while, but after you get your DR up it becomes less important, while the wands can be used up to level 40, their usefulness growing as you get more and more dispellable while facing casters of increasing levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n EDIT V: Redid stats as per WhiZard's suggestion, gaining 1 Reflex save and losing nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div>"

I can only think of stat buffs, which are easily dispellable and thus unreliable. I'd rather keep Expertise. Actually I would like to take this chance to mention that Empower Spell wouldn't even be my second choice for this build. 1st: Expertise, 2nd: IKD, 3rd: Empower Spell, 4th: Improved Critical (which would require you to delay that last Cleric level because you'd need the DD Weapon Proficiency Martial to take it in the Warhammer). But yes, Expertise is not part of the build's core, it's just my personal preference and can be tweaked to taste.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for Concentration, all the points put on Spot can go there, I guess, but u'd still get Taunted most of the time because they only start coming around at a certain point in the build. And, you'd resist most of the damage after a certain while. But I'll do that, I'll remove spot and put those skill points there, as it's not essential,\u00a0but other than that skill points are pretty tight...<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n I'll alter this when I get home from work later today.
