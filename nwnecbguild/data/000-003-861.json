Now firmly back in the Forgotten Realms. I've been making some builds that I've liked a lot lately. One I like less is my rogue, cleric, fighter. I'm trying to make an elven pc that uses heavy armour, a longbow and Zen archery. I'd like to use divine might and shield. I've gone with sun and healing as domains. It really looks as if the strength, wis, charisma split is going to keep this concept from being very potent. I'm running it through the original campaign and it's a bit of a struggle. Any suggestions appreciated. <br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my G3125 using Tapatalk<br/>\n<br/>\n<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I usually start with a portrait pic I find online and try to make something like I imagine that pic would be (a very unscientific approach I know). I try to get the first level as good as possible and then relevel the character if things go pear shaped. I'll take your advice and try one of the other avenues.<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my G3125 using Tapatalk<br/>\n<br/>\n<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If you want heavy armour, it's Str time. You'll eventually want at least 19 Wis, and that makes Cha unviable. High Cha would mean being stuck with low Str and Dex (8 Dex to cap to 12 with Cat, and 8 Str to set to 18 with DP), and while you'd have many Divine might&amp;shield uses, you'd be stuck with low AB (a cleric with AB problems :) ) and fighter-like sword&amp;board AC, which isn't terrible but isn't awesome either, but at least you could boost that high with divine shield. Bottom line, whenever you build something with cleric, there is always something better to spend your ability points on than charisma, unfortunately.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, if you're struggling, cleric is best when front-loaded, rushing for Cleric 12 (and eventually at least 15) asap, with no or very few multiclass levels taken before that. EDIT: it's a bijection - when front-loaded, cleric is THE best* :)<br/>\n<br/>\n*but sorcerers are even better, however, this has nothing to do with your questions<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Is there a particular reason you're looking for ranged attack over melee? If it's just because you feel like it, that's grand, but it seems to me there are better classes than cleric for shooting folk in the face - particularly for elves.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, nice to see you back with the real people!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Halfling would be ok, but would need a shortbow or thrown weapon (does Zen Archery even apply to slings?) I know this is less of a concern in PWs than in SP module play, but thought it might be worth pointing out. Actually, while I'm at it, why is there no race with Cleric as its preferred class? I know Drow females <em>should</em> have it, but don't. Oh, never mind, I might as well ask the same about Ranger, Bard, Monk, Sorcerer, Druid and Paladin.
