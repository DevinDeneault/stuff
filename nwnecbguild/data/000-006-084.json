classes:<br/>\nYou get an undispellable cleric with the best bard-/curse song combination available, and the full bard skill-set for skills like discipline, taunt, tumble etc.<br/>\nThe Bard spells, albeit dispellable, supplement the cleric spells and add freedom when deciding on cleric domains.<br/>\nThe bard spells are auto-stilled for carefree casting in full armor.<br/>\nTrickery domain was chosen for undispellable 50 % concealment from Improved invisibility. You can get it as a bard spell, but it comes late and can be dispelled.<br/>\nPlant was chosen for the extra +5 AC from Barkskin.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther builds like this one: There are a couple of pure cleric/bard builds in the old archive. They are mostly designed like casters and support characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrengths: Heavy hitting undispellable cleric with bard goodies. Strong attack, defence, saves etc. Strong party buffer. Versatile with a large arsenal of spells. High critical threat range.<br/>\nWeaknesses: A bit low on HP for a melee character. Depends on buffs. Bard spells can be dispelled. You may run out of quick-slots.<br/>\n<br/>\nTweaks:<br/>\nTake Lingering song at level 1 and drop Improved critical or Blind fight<br/>\nChoose other domains like war, strength or travel.<br/>\nPick exotic weapon prof. rather than martial eg. if you want a katana for higher base damage<br/>\nIf True seeing is altered, you can choose listen and boost it with amplify.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: edited the intro, skills and tweaks<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thank you guys for the feedback!<br/>\n The fact that you need level 9 spells for auto-still, makes it unusual in bard builds. Here I use cleric, that has no need for the feats at all, to qualify for what benefits the bard part.<br/>\n<br/>\n Not every encounter will try to dispel you, but Hip is right, \"that cleric behind him\" occurs quite often.<br/>\n The songs and taunt are rock solid contributors to AB and AC, and won't be dispelled.<br/>\n If Mage Armor, Haste and Cat's grace are dispelled, you will lose 7AC, a serious hit, but not enough to kill you right away. And the caster actually casting dispel in fact buys you time to attack and knock him over before something more dangerous is thrown at you.<br/>\n The caracter has 6 slots for lvl 3 bard spells (3 regular and 3 extended) and has 3 left after buffing up with Keen edge, Whispers and Haste. If dispelled, you still have 3 slots left for recasting.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Like many other cleric builds B&amp;F\u00a0lost some of it's power when 1.69 changed that to +4 deflection AC, which is better covered with the lvl 1 spell Shield of faith; and more importantly, deflection AC does not stack.<br/>\n What makes it possible for S&amp;S\u00a0to compare with B&amp;F\u00a0is the boost from bard level 16. These things are well known to experienced bard players.<br/>\n Song: +2 AB +5 AC (stackable dodge AC) for you and your party.<br/>\n Curse song: -2 AB, -5 AC for hostile creatures, which translates to +2 AC and +5 AB for you and your party.<br/>\n A high taunt skill\u00a0inflicts -6 AC\u00a0on the successfully taunted, and that also translates to +6 AB for you.<br/>\n The \"AB gain\" caused by reduced AC on your opponents is not subject to the +20 AB cap. That is important for clerics since they are able to buff their AB to the cap.<br/>\n The sum from song, curse song and taunt is: +13 to AB and +7 to AC.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hey Mick, this is a very good build, and I know to some extent it's intended as is, but do you actually NEED 24 Cleric levels? You'll probably\u00a0be dispelled anyway, because at level 30 you will encounter more Mord's casters than Greater dispellers, and you only need to be able to cast level 9 spells for the Autostill feats. So, the addition of a 3rd class (especially if you consider that you used the Cleric 23 feat for AS) in exchange for 4 Cleric levels will only add to the build's power. If you add 4 Fighter and make it Cleric 20 Bard 16 Fighter 4 you trade some dispelability for WS / EWS whilst maintaining the same AB (just take all fighter levels in Epics and take EWF or EP as a Fighter bonus feat on Fighter 2 freeing up a slot for WS to be taken on a general feat level). Fighter 1- Armor Skin (substitute for Cleric 23 BF), Fighter 2- Epic Prowess or Epic Weapon Focus (which frees up a General feat), Fighter 4 (taken on a general feat level) - WS / EWS.<br/>\n<br/>\n If you don't want XP Penalty (which the aforementioned tweak would result in), you can go with CoT, add +2 to saves and get an extra feat with which you could then round up your CHA at 16.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

But with all the intrinsic strength combined with divine buffs and bardic power I doubt seriously that +6 slashing damage will ever become a deal-breaker.\u00a0 More times than not, the divine buffs that pierce DR make the difference rather than the physical damage.\u00a0 Ask any pile of rubbish that was formerly an iron golem.<br/>\n<br/>\n Looking at it from my own experience, there is nothing more annoying than getting all dressed up for a party (i.e. spending 15 mins self-buffing) only to have some lame-arse mobs of dispellers neutralize your innate power making you just another pretty face in the crowd.\u00a0 Seldom do high-level arcanists appear in groups larger than 2 or 3 and even in those cases, stoneskinning a summon or 3 to attack in the middle of a mage encounter while ethereal usually draws the Mords out of the queue fairly quickly making them easier to counter.\u00a0 Once they are limited to lower dispels, the buffs are secured by Clc 24.<br/>\n<br/>\n Clc 24/ Bard 16 seems just perfect to me! <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Mick chose Weapon Prof: Martial to gain access to the scimitar (later supported by Improved Crit: scimitar). \u00a0How \"important\" is a damage dealing (i.e., crit delivering) weapon to this build? \u00a0I was thinking of dropping both of those feats in preference of others (see below) and using a cudgel .. erm mace.<br/>\n 2. I would like to get Lingering Song in there as well ... that extra 5 rounds is pretty handy in a fight.<br/>\n 3. Max Spell or IKD ... this is tough one for me ... KD is nice, but I find it best if it is a prelude to IKD .... \u00a0Also like maximized Blade Bariers and Ice Storms ....\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n So ... I am thinking of changing the pre-epic feats to:<br/>\n 1. Curse Song / Blind Fight<br/>\n 3. Weapon Focus: Mace<br/>\n 6. KD<br/>\n 9. Extend Spell<br/>\n 12. Lingering Song<br/>\n 15. Max Spell (or IKD???)<br/>\n 18. Still Spell<br/>\n<br/>\n Have I gimped this toon? \u00a0Or am I still OK ... \u00a0Thanks for any help.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Yeah, KD won't hit much that early, especially without cleric buffs so, sure, bumping Curse Song up earlier makes sense to me.\u00a0 But that is more a sequencing issue than performance.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Better vs. skels, much less useful vs. all others.\u00a0 Crits with divine buffs, all of which will deliver irresistable (divine) damage, is significant.\u00a0 You could certainly save a feat without martial weaponry but scimi (or exotic/kukri) would also be my choice. <br/>\n<br/>\n6.\u00a0 (see comment at 1.)<br/>\n<br/>\n9.\u00a0 -No change-<br/>\n<br/>\n12. \"Handy\" or \"Nice\" is not power-building.\u00a0 It's like Persuade being \"handy\" when a build hasn't addressed its power-related skills in toto yet.\u00a0\u00a0 But you are right.\u00a0 It <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">is</span> handy, just not a feat worth striving to gain with 16 turns per day already at hand.<br/>\n<br/>\n15.\u00a0 This addresses the issue of what to select for the one feat saved by bypassing martial weaponry.\u00a0 For me, it would be Empower Spell hands-down.\u00a0 The empowered ability buffs, both arcane and divine, are difference-makers, especially within lower magic environments and offensive boosts earlier (2 slots advanced instead of 3).\u00a0 Enabling empowered abilities means you don't need to compromise gearing decisions as severely in regards to capping the levels.\u00a0 But whatever floats your boat.\u00a0 If you like casting spells that don't rely on a dice roll, grab it.\u00a0 <br/>\n<br/>\nIn this build, IKD would also be a luxury (i.e. \"handy) due to the feat starvation these two classes always pose. The important feat is still plain 'ol KD vs. those high mage types that would otherwise be queued with Time Stop or other such nonsense.\u00a0 At least dropping them for a round gives your toon a chance for a follow-up.<br/>\n<br/>\n18. -No change- ... Actually I would have swapped this (Stilled spells) 3 levels sooner to be able to spam Balagarn's earlier (and safer!) while postponing the crit range upgrade.\u00a0 But that is nitpicking IMO and more a personal choice than performance optimization.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think at least one of your points was covered in Mick's suggested tweaks section.\u00a0 I'm certain, when he arrives to respond, he'll detail his thought process about the rest of your ideas.\u00a0 But now you have mine, as well, such as it is, eh? <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>edit: omg so many typos</em><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'd missed that conception.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, it would seem we are back to the original build with perhaps some reording for nits ... :)<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks again for your comments.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Mick chose Weapon Prof: Martial to gain access to the scimitar (later supported by Improved Crit: scimitar). \u00a0How \"important\" is a damage dealing (i.e., crit delivering) weapon to this build? \u00a0I was thinking of dropping both of those feats in preference of others (see below) and using a cudgel .. erm mace.<br/>\n 2. I would like to get Lingering Song in there as well ... that extra 5 rounds is pretty handy in a fight.<br/>\n 3. Max Spell or IKD ... this is tough one for me ... KD is nice, but I find it best if it is a prelude to IKD .... \u00a0Also like maximized Blade Bariers and Ice Storms ....\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n So ... I am thinking of changing the pre-epic feats to:<br/>\n 1. Curse Song / Blind Fight<br/>\n 3. Weapon Focus: Mace<br/>\n 6. KD<br/>\n 9. Extend Spell<br/>\n 12. Lingering Song<br/>\n 15. Max Spell (or IKD???)<br/>\n 18. Still Spell<br/>\n<br/>\n Have I gimped this toon? \u00a0Or am I still OK ... \u00a0Thanks for any help.</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">Hi Andare!<br/>\n I am pleased to see that you have been thinking along the same lines as I have, and want to make this kind of build.<br/>\n As for your questions, first of all at level 20 this character only has 4 bard levels. They are there for skill dumps and taking Curse song pre epic, a feat that blooms much later. Curse song is essential for the build idea. I explain why in my <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2354698/Master-of-Performance-a-Bard-guide\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bard guide</a>.But the main point is covered pretty well here in this thread too. I suggest Lingering song as a tweak. That too must be taken at a bard level (L1 or L12).<br/>\n Still spell comes late, because the build doesn't need it before bard can cast at least lvl 2 spells.<br/>\n Extend can come earlier if you want to extend your low level cleric spells early on.<br/>\n Knockdown is there to dominate mages and other annoying things. The message is: Stay down there and shut up!<br/>\n It comes early simply because some of the other feats cannot come that early, and KD is one of the feats that can come at lvl 1. IKD is better than KD, but this build is feat starved.<br/>\n You want to take a simple weapon. The build will work with that, but like Hip said; a martial or exotic weapon is generally much stronger. You can always use a blunt weapon as backup vs skellies and such. The character as is, will handle that well, even without the weapon feats. I would not pick mace though, unless you want to take advantage of an uber weapon where you play. Mace is great as a blunt finessable weapon, but both morningstar and warhammer have better damage. But then again, this build has better ways of dealing with undead.<br/>\n \u00a0</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
