      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Similar to Mick Dagger's  thread about the \"Kukri Master\" i decided to do a revision of the classic \" <strong>Dwarven Wall </strong>\".<br/>\n<br/>\nThis toon is very old school when Dev. Critical was everything and all tried to put it inside their builds with different combinations.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also one of the characters that  qualifies for the \"pure builds\" somehow as it takes all 30 levels of a prestige class, fortunately unlike many other prestige classes the Dwarven Defender<br/>\n<br/>\nactually takes some benefits from these last levels, unlikely say the Blackguard or the Weapon's Master where their benefits stop at 28th level for both.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile this build lacks a full tumble class it has comparable AC due to Defensive Stance and the awesomeness of the Defensive Awareness provides it with a very solid defesnse.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a Classic old beater that has Massive HP's and Damage Reduction and the good old Dev. Critical all in one build.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I have a somewhat similar build of my own (Ftr 12 Rog 2 DD 26). I read a guide in the old guild by Thax, which sort of disagrees with the order you take your feats. The \"bread and butter\" of DD is the Damage Reduction. It's what makes him what he is. Anyway, the guide basically said that if you want to make use of the class to its best, you need to not only take EDR feats but take them as soon as possible. The CON investment means that you won't have a high DC to your DevCrit, so prioritizing it in this case I would say is not optimal. On the other hand, I play on WoG too and I know that there, it's most useful when taken early on. What I don't know is, does taking DC before the EDR feats come in this build as a WoG-biased choice or is it due to something else?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would change only the order you take the feats in epics and the stat point distribution to have EDR 3 ASAP. As for the rest, it looks good. The only feat I would probably change would be SF<img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" />iscipline. I'd take Expertise in its place to save up Defensive Stance uses for more important battles. Other than that, I'd give him a Dwarven Waraxe for style points.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Oh yes, the power one can gain from taking 4 less DD levels is indeed splendid, i just could not do it for theme reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\nNice catch on the weapon choice but i wanted a bigger threat range as you can imagine while maintaining the big base damage of the Bastard, and since the original too had a sword..<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as EDR goes the funny thing is that the original went as fast as he could for Dev. critical too but due to unoptimized stats he couldn't do it till the 36th level, so i think i managed quite well on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood point the expertise option Max, although what kept me from taking it was that it cancels out the defensive stance. Still a good option early on when your stances are few i suppose.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the input man, all good points.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Yes, Expertise does cancel Defensive Stance, but they aren't meant to be used simultaneously, they're meant to be used instead of one another. There's no such thing as too many DS uses, and Expertise allows you to go through mobs without wasting any in cases where you need AC but can afford the loss in AB, which we both know on WoG is VERY USEFUL. In that Diablo-themed mod you advertised, I reckon the same is true.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I'd still recommend going for EDR before DevCrit. 9 points of DR right from the start of epics will allow you to stand in front of your enemies for MUCH LONGER. If you equip a belt of Damage Resistance, you'll only be damaged on Crits. As Thax used to say, if you want to kill things fast, go for Weapon Master or RDD, Dwarven Defenders are good at tanking.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Hell, you might even consider taking it even earlier and delay Cleave. The usefulness of Cleave depends on how often you expect / plan to be surrounded by 2 or more foes. If you are one that treads carefully (I'm not, just saying), then its usefulness is decreased. If you're a bit of a maniac such as yours truly, then you can keep it as is.

Bastard sword was better for Dev Crit, or scimitar would be even better, but since you're sacrificing some threat range to better fit the dwarven theme, you might as well go for dwarven waraxe and drop Dev Crit for more strength.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo do this, take Weapon Proficiency Exotic and Weapon Focus: Dwarven Waraxe at level 1, Expertise at level 18, and Improve Expertise instead of Great Cleave at level 20. Then take Epic Weapon Focus at level 21, and use the DD feats at levels 24, 28, and 32 for EDR, which should allow you to get 6 Great Strength feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also would swap Blind Fight with Improved Crit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking \"Is there any way to get Expertise earlier?\" and realized that yes there is: Take your 8th level of Fighter at level 8 instead of level 18.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

By the level you get the Dev. Critical you will have a keen Warhammer<br/>\n<br/>\n anyway be it single player module or in a Persistant World.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout Dev. Critical, the DC is perfectly fine and you will see many one-hit KO's by it. A level forty warrior type with 22 CON in a server (or module) without arbitrary set attributes will have a modified 28 fort save. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe will still fail his save at least half the times against the Dwarven Wall. And STR is a primary attribute to raise for the Dwarven Wall so the gap will be even wider than this example.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
