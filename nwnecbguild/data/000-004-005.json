A full compliment of Dwarven Defender stuff as well as a rogue toolkit. Very modifiable to fit into the environment in which you play.<br/>\n<br/>\nPros:<br/>\n- Good AB<br/>\n- Disables locks and traps<br/>\n- Immune to sneak attacks while attacking<br/>\n- 6/- resistance to all physical damage and plenty of HP<br/>\n- Evasion and KD for casters, Improved disarm for other melee.<br/>\n- AC is not bad<br/>\n<br/>\nCons:<br/>\n- Does not really become a rogue until level 20<br/>\n- Saves outside of stance are mediocre<br/>\n- Wants more skill points<br/>\n- Feels feat-starved even with 8 Fighter levels<br/>\n- Needs access to good gear to perform well. 17 modified UMD helps a little.<br/>\n- Racial restriction of dwarf means human is not possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nRogue 2 / Fighter 8 / Dwarven Defender 10<br/>\nDwarf<br/>\nAlignment: Any lawful<br/>\nPvM 1-20<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 17 (22)<br/>\nDEX: 13<br/>\nCON: 16<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 6<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Rogue(1): Luck of Heroes<br/>\n02: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br/>\n03: Fighter(2): Iron Will, Dodge<br/>\n04: Fighter(3): STR+1 (STR=18)<br/>\n05: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Scimitar<br/>\n06: Fighter(5): Toughness<br/>\n07: Fighter(6): Knockdown<br/>\n08: Fighter(7): STR+1 (STR= 19)<br/>\n09: Dwarven Defender(1): Lightning Reflexes<br/>\n10: Fighter(8): Improved Critical: Scimitar<br/>\n11: Dwarven Defender(2):\u00a0<br/>\n12: Dwarven Defender(3): STR +1(STR=20) Disarm<br/>\n13: Dwarven Defender(4):\u00a0<br/>\n14: Dwarven Defender(5):\u00a0<br/>\n15: Dwarven Defender(6): Improved Disarm<br/>\n16: Dwarven Defender(7): STR+1 (STR=21)<br/>\n17: Dwarven Defender(8):\u00a0<br/>\n18: Dwarven Defender(9): Blind Fight<br/>\n19: Dwarven Defender(10):\u00a0<br/>\n20: Rogue(2): STR+1 (STR=22)<br/>\n<br/>\nBAB: 19<br/>\nHit points: 292<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 17/11/12 (+2 vs spells)<br/>\nAB (mundane scimitar): +26/21/16/11<br/>\nDamage: 1d8 +8 (15-20/x2)<br/>\nAC (mundane full plate + tower shield): 26<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Stance:<br/>\nHit points: 332<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 21/13/14 (+2 vs spells)<br/>\nAB (mundane scimitar): +27/22/17/12<br/>\nDamage: 1d8 +9 (15-20/x2)<br/>\nAC (mundane full plate + tower shield): 30<br/>\n<br/>\nSkill points: 122<br/>\nDiscipline(22), Tumble(20), Disable Trap(23), Open Lock(23), Search(15), UMD(19)<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscipline on Fighter / DWD levels, everything else on Rogue levels. Skills might be somewhat off, I'm looking into getting something to do skills better.<br/>\n<br/>\nPotential changes include dropping 2 points in STR to bring WIS to 12 and DEX to 14 for +2 will and +1 reflex save at the cost of 1 AB and Damage. It would make the build more survivable and give small bonuses to rogue skills but I decided against it, since 1 AB is a lot in a pre-epic build. Similarly you could drop 2 points of CON for 2 points of WIS, netting +1 will but -1 fort and -20 HP.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I do like the thought, Edd - oh, and welcome aboard, btw!<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I might change a few things here. First, you don't really need LoH - your Will save is going to suck no matter what, so you should just bite on it. If you do that, you can drop Fighter down to 6 and up Rogue to 4 for much easier skill dumps, more skill points, better Reflex saves, a couple of d6 sneak attacks, Uncanny Dodge, and no loss of AB. If the subsequent dip in Fortitude seems to hurt, drop Lightning Reflexes for Great Fort (you'll have picked up the Reflex difference by the extra Rogue levels anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Disarm twins are somewhat situational, but can be very useful if you're playing where they work. If not, you could drop them and replace with IKD and taking Weapon Proficiency: Exotic for a proper dwarf's weapon (I understand why you went for scimmy, but still, it just offends my dwarven sensibilities). Oh, and while we're on matters dwarven, your starting stats don't add up - did you mean CHA 6?<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers will know better how to use teknolegy for skill point distribution: I just sit down and work them out by hand and head.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, welcome to the Guild!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Sorry, meant to mention the possibility of taking Power Attack and Cleave as alternatives to the Disarm twins - and Cleave doesn't break Defensive Stance, which is nice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT 2:</em></strong> It seems what I was suggesting already exists: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-gate-keeper-fighter-6-dd-10-rogue-4-t2350640.html#p590\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Gate Keeper</a><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">It seems like I totally missed Kali and Valerfor's work into Ftr/Rog/DwD. I think I like their builds more than mine\u00a0<img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\nI chose the Disarm twins for one primary reason: The build takes on dexers and sneakers very well innately, and has KD and a sack of HP to help against casters. One thing that it's not very good at is dealing with high damage fighter types (Paladins, Clerics etc). Presuming that enemies won't immediately re-equip the weapon (ie players), swapping a high damage melee from their potential d12 Greataxe to being unarmed helps a lot in getting the most out of the DwD DR.<br/>\n<br/>\nPower Attack / Cleave would be a great replacement if you wanted to. The reason I stayed away from both Power Attack (and therefore Cleave) and Expertise is that they both cancel the DwD stance, and I think the stance is much better than either PA or Expertise. If you wanted to swap out disarm, IKD and Skill Focus: Discipline would be my choices. You could also swap out a number of feats for elemental resistances if they are particularly powerful in your environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI fixed the abilities (thanks, Stag!) and totally agree that this boy not having an axe is a travesty. You can switch to battleaxe if you prefer!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
