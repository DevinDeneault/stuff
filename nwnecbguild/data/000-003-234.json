      "content": "<div>Okay so yeah this is somewhat fast, got killed by drow again with my new lovely character, whom had joined the guard, Waymen, and pretty much Warden of a tower x.x. And since you aren't allowed to roll the same character with the same concept immediately (Build wise. and character wise) after or before, meaning I can't do the lovely rogue either, yet. I want help with a blackguard. ^^. Came to me since my friend wants us to do evil together, ish. But, there's a problem, smite might not do any good, people make Lawful Neutral characters to be either paladins (though not the class,unless they are paladins which is Lawful Good) or Evil guys, to avoid being smited. Thus, I do not think it would be proper to focus around that element. I'm hoping to use a Bastard Sword, but if that may not be viable I'm open to other suggestions (though, I think the bastard sword would be very nice.) But, I'd like to hear your thoughts on this, the server is Arelith, lv 30 to my knowledge depending on what you decide might be best, I think there are no possible changes.</div>"

You will need the gifts of strength &amp; charisma to start like this as a Human \"Str 19, Dex 8, Con 10, Int 13, Wis 8, Cha 18\". Then everything goes to strength and you will end-up with 30 strength/ 18 charisma with ews &amp; 7d6 sneak attack. This build will also have full tumble, evasion, umd, good saves, divine feats, a no-father-sword and much more. But it will be of little use if you get sacrificed again, so choose the correct side this time.</div>"

I suppose the extra skill points, and feat would be beneficial. Hmm.. well let me know what ya come up with ^^. Hopefully, it'll use a bastard sword, I really want it using that ^^.

      "content": "<div>You have to play a Human for the build to work properly but the good news are that he not only has a bastard sword, but all the divine feats he could get on, as well. Fighter instead of Rogue in the beginning was chosen because of playability so you can start with all necessary feats immediately. Both Charisma and Strength are main stats for you and you must take care to max them if possible (including temporal buffs through umd) for best results. Your saving throws with buffed Charisma are very high and so is your armour class, and damage is excellent. This is an advanced build however and to get the best out of it, you need to use your abilities, such as Divine Might/ Shield, Expertise/ Taunt and Improved Knockdown to name a few. The tools are there, but you need to know how to use them. I suspect however, being in the (correct?) side this time, will give you enough time for this.<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://i1375.photobucket.com/albums/ag474/valerfor/Black%20Knight_zpsbcduy6tg.jpg\"/><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:120%;line-height:normal\"><strong>ARELITH BLACK KNIGHT: (FTR 10/ ROG 4/ BG 16)</strong></span><br/>\n<br/>\n RACE: Human<br/>\n ALIGNMENT: LE<br/>\n PLAYABILITY: PvM 1-30 lvl<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:100%;line-height:normal\"><strong>STARTING/ ENDING STATS</strong></span>: (<span style=\"font-size:100%;line-height:normal\"><strong>GIFT's +2 STR/ +2 CHA</strong></span>)<br/>\n STR \u2013 17 (<strong>28</strong>)<br/>\n DEX \u2013 08<br/>\n CON - 14<br/>\n INT -\u00a0\u00a0 14<br/>\n WIS \u2013 08<br/>\n CHA \u201318<br/>\n<br/>\n Hit Points: <strong>354</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n Skill Points: <strong>189</strong>\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Discipline: 33 (42)<br/>\n Hide: 6 (5)<br/>\n Heal: 33 (32)<br/>\n Spellcraft: 14 (15) cc<br/>\n Tumble: 30 (29)<br/>\n Taunt: 33 (37)<br/>\n UMD: 26 (30)<br/>\n<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fort/Ref/Will): 24/ 16/ 14 \u2192 27/ 19/ 17 (saves Vs spells)<br/>\n w/ Max-Charisma (Fort/Ref/Will): 30/ 22/ 20 \u2192 33/ 25/ 23 (saves Vs spells)<br/>\n Naked/ Armoured AC: 17/ 28 (Plate &amp; Shield)<br/>\n<br/>\n BAB: 24 (Four Attacks)<br/>\n AB: +37/ +32/ +27/ +22 (Bastard Sword)<br/>\n DMG: 1d10 +15/ 17-20 x2 (Bastard Sword)<br/>\n<br/>\n Spellcasting: BG's spell-like abilities and UMD<br/>\n Divine Might: +10 Divine Dmg/ 10 Rounds (Buffed)<br/>\n Divine Shield: +10 Dodge AC/ 10 Rounds (Buffed)<br/>\n Taunt: 43 +1d20 (Buffed)<br/>\n Sneak Attack 7d6 &amp; IKD<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:100%;line-height:normal\"><strong>LEVELING GUIDE:</strong></span><br/>\n 01) Fighter (01): EWP: Bastard Sword, WF: Bastard Sword, Expertise<br/>\n 02) Fighter (02): Power Attack<br/>\n 03) Fighter (03): Cleave<br/>\n 04) Fighter (04): WS: Bastard Sword<br/>\n 05) Fighter (05):<br/>\n 06) Fighter (06): Blind Fight, Knockdown<br/>\n 07) Fighter (07):<br/>\n 08) Rogue (01):<br/>\n 09) Rogue (02): <em>Evasion</em>, IC: Bastard Sword<br/>\n 10) Rogue (03): <em>Uncanny Dodge</em><br/>\n 11) Blackguard (01):<br/>\n 12) Blackguard (02): Improved Knockdown<br/>\n 13) Blackguard (03):<br/>\n 14) Blackguard (04):<br/>\n 15) Blackguard (05): Divine Shield<br/>\n 16) Blackguard (06):<br/>\n 17) Blackguard (07):<br/>\n 18) Blackguard (08): Divine Might<br/>\n 19) Blackguard (09):<br/>\n 20) Blackguard (10):<br/>\n 21) Fighter (08): EWF: Bastard Sword, Great STR (1)<br/>\n 22) Fighter (09):<br/>\n 23) Fighter (10): EWS: Bastard Sword<br/>\n 24) Blackguard (11): Great STR (2)<br/>\n 25) Blackguard (12):<br/>\n 26) Blackguard (13): Armour Skin<br/>\n 27) Rogue (04): Great STR (3)<br/>\n 28) Blackguard (14):<br/>\n 29) Blackguard (15):<br/>\n 30) Blackguard (16): Epic Prowess, Great STR (4)<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>Good build, Val!<br/>\n<br/>\n You should start with 18 STR and 17 CHA for +1 AB from level 1. Divine Feats and BG only come way later, so no reason to start with 17 STR and 18 CHA.<br/>\n<br/>\n Only other\u00a0tweak I'd suggest here and only as a 50-50 kind of personal preference tweak\u00a0is to drop 2 Great Strengths for Epic Fiendish Servant (I know it's shit but could help a lot for generating sneak attacks) OR Epic Fortitude (for insta-death spells)\u00a0and Epic Skill Focus: Discipline. Having 42 Discipline you won't necessarily be upright a lot, especially fighting high-AB meleers or Battle Cleric toons. I think a fairly safe number for you to be sure you'll stay upright would be around 50.<br/>\n<br/>\n A dedicated meleer will have 25 BAB + 8 STR, + 4 WF/EWF/EP = 37. That is\u00a0with absolutely no STR, Weapon and other enhancements. You could get up to +6 on your discipline with STR increases and that's it, they could get +6 from STR to AB as well, plus weapon enhancements such as GMW for another +5 which brings them exactly to your Discipline total, add Bless, Aid, Prayer and debuffs, and you probably will get KDed. Hell, even 51 Discipline doesn't sound that safe anymore. I think ESF: Discipline is a must for this guy.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Youe first suggestion is good Max, gives 1 ab for a couple of levels earlier, i won't edit the build because of the known forum problems, but do as Max said and instead go (at 4th lvl) for +1 cha/ then everything to str after that.<br/>\n<br/>\n The second one, it has it's merits and i would take the esf in it, except this character can get his AC so high, that most of his opponents attacks won't hit him, and if we factor improved invisibility through umd and expertise, the chances to get hit are pretty slim. He could use rogue's hood as well to become completely immune to knockdowns too (if there is such an item on Arelith). Anyway if he really needs that much discipline (58 instead of 48) then he could start with Str 18/ Con 12/ Cha 18 and take Esf: Discipline instead of the first Great STR and there you have it. That would mean -30 Hp's &amp; -1 Fort though.</div>"
