I tend to use this build most everywhere in PvE environments, I don't play on PvP servers so can't speak to them, the server I play on has a minimum 5 levels/class at 40 restriction and the typical no alignment changes etc rules regarding character builds. The build is intended to serve as a tank character specifically meant to absorb damage while the squishier folks kill things and to that end does so extremely well. Have not encountered any glaring weaknesses in the environment. Comments welcome.  I have a story to go along with but it's fairly lengthy and not completely written, I can post what I have if desired. It explains better how the character developed into using the build over time, and accounts for the various class and armament usages through backstory RP buildup.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Max reminded me, I did have a Cat's Grace going, and also according to the script window where I play all items are absorbed, double checked the AC in combat log, if that's still lieing than I'm not sure what to mark down.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I don't know how you can reach 102 AC with this build on a +5 environment. I don't know if you are aware of this, but the character sheet lies when it comes to Druids and Shifted shapes. Only Armor AC type applies to Dragon Shape (armor, shield and helm), so you will only receive bonuses from the highest AC item you have (a +5 armor and a +5 shield will only give you +5 AC). Amulet, Ring, Weapon, Bracers, Boots will not merge. And I wouldn't call such an environment low magic. It's a +5 with many properties, so IMO that is mid-magic. Anyway, AC in Dragon Shape will be 2 points lower than what is shown in the sheet, and AB is 4 points higher. I have a 46 Wisdom Druid Dragonshaper that has 3 less Monk AC points, but 1 more Wisdom AC point and ends up at 84 AC in a +5 Environment, and that includes a Cat`s Grace potion, which you don`t count in your math. So unless there is a custom modification to your server, I don`t see how you can reach 102 AC on a +5 setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I wasn't aware of the character sheet issue, though on the server I play it says in the scripts window it absorbs everything, as for the low magic clause that's from the server's own descriptor. I forgot cat's grace, derp, with that that should put me at +12 dex in addition to the server absorb script, maybe that's where my extra AC is from and the server absorb claok deflection AC bonus? *shrug* I did say end result would vary based on equipment and setting.

To know what's going on, you need to open up your game console (go into a stand-alone trainer and do so, and/or really pay attention to all of the numbers in play testing. <br/>\n<br/>\nI've played around with shifter/druids, and dragon shape is really neat. Might want to have a look through the build index for druid/shifter builds by Thax and Kail, both posting some nice dragon forms in ye old time ECB guild --Thax in particular loved the shifter (they really liked the dragon), Xylo and Finn have some versatile shifter/druid/monk builds as well. Understand changes were made as a result of patches since, though. That said, not everything merges and there are caps, as has been said. For Dragon shape for e.g. used to be that only armor merges (only the highest AC bonus from armor (armor, shield, helmet), as I recall, but that could have changed, though I somehow doubt it. Could be that your world is doing something else, however (always possible, this is most true).  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to there not being any similar builds, I see 24 druid/monk/shifter builds in the index, 2 of which seem to employ your same level split (see, Long Death/Old Order Shifter druid 5 / shifter 17 / monk 18 (half-elf?) by Toadbat and Pikel's Better Half druid 5 / monk 18 / shifter 17 (dwarf?) by KingHarbromm ). For some reason, not all similar builds showed up in the old ECB guild either, don't know why, just that you had to do a double check sometimes. No worries, just might want to have a look through those (although with the patch/changes ... ). Aside from that, only problem I see is that you seem to be relying on spell buffs, which are dispellable (need more caster levels to avoid that; more levels in shifter by contrast only seem to effect i.e. Rak icestorms and DCs like dragon breath weapons). Still, druid/monk/shifters are nifty, a lot of strategy involved (half the fun being in choosing the right shape for the job), and tend to do best in low magic worlds. That said, the dragon is pretty cool, a pain for sneaky types, and the Rak ice bugs mages.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Yea, I certainly yhe low magic servers and non-PVp ones, this build would likely be silly wrecked else where. I just wanted to share it because I've used it ever since I started NWN way back in right after Hords released. And also I know it works yp to the latest..and likely last official patch. ^^<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
