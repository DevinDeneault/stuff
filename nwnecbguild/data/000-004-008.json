Taunting can take away -6AC from your target, effectively increasing your AB by +6. You may combine it with Expertise for +5 to AC and +1 to AB, and if you take the Power attack feat (instead of Expertise or IKD) +1 to AB and +5 to damage. You will have to find the skillpoints for taunt somewhere, and it will come at a cost. Perform, Spellcraft and UMD are candidates.<br/>\n<br/>\n .<em><span style=\"color:#000000\">edit: per Hip 20160627 (corrections/additions of missing info, in</span></em><span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong> red</strong></span><em><span style=\"color:#000000\">)</span></em></div>",

If you took Bard at level 1, you would be right about needing 11 charisma, but you don't when taking it any time later in a build. Here, Bard is taken for i) access to AA, ii) access to skills: Tumble, UMD and Spellcraft, and iii) Bard Song. It's not being taken for spell-casting.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps (and hope Mick agrees!)<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",
