You already do that IRL? You might need help.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nAs for those of us who rather role play that kind of thing I present a hard-hitting DR tank. It's a fun build that basically plays itself, perfect for when I don't really want to do anything and I'm too snockered to anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span class=\"inline-attachment\">\n<dl class=\"fileimage display\">\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/201902/10759017_b7bcad3fcd09a2545524ab77565708a8_t.png\" />\n</dl>\n</span><br/>\n<br/>\nDwarven Defender(14), Monk(20), Fighter(6), Dwarf<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nSTR: 16 (26)<br/>\nDEX: 14<br/>\nCON: 18 (22)<br/>\nWIS: 10<br/>\nINT: 10<br/>\nCHA: 6<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nDwarf: (Darkvision, Defensive Training vs. Giants, Stonecunning, Hardiness vs. Poison, Hardiness vs. Spells, Offensive Training vs. Goblinoids, Offensive Training vs. Orcs, Skill Affinity: Lore)<br/>\n01: Monk(1): Blind Fight, {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}<br/>\n02: Monk(2): {Deflect Arrows}<br/>\n03: Monk(3): Weapon Focus: Unarmed<br/>\n04: Monk(4): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n05: Monk(5)<br/>\n06: Monk(6): Toughness, {Knockdown, Improved Knockdown}<br/>\n07: Monk(7)<br/>\n08: Monk(8): STR+1, (STR=18)<br/>\n09: Monk(9): Dodge, {Improved Evasion}<br/>\n10: Monk(10)<br/>\n11: Dwarven Defender(1): {Defensive Stance}<br/>\n12: Monk(11): CON+1, Improved Critical: Unarmed, (CON=19)<br/>\n13: Dwarven Defender(2): {Defensive Awareness I}<br/>\n14: Dwarven Defender(3)<br/>\n15: Dwarven Defender(4): Iron Will<br/>\n16: Dwarven Defender(5): CON+1, (CON=20)<br/>\n17: Monk(12)<br/>\n18: Dwarven Defender(6): Lightning Reflexes<br/>\n19: Dwarven Defender(7)<br/>\n20: Dwarven Defender(8): CON+1, (CON=21)<br/>\n21: Fighter(1): Epic Weapon Focus: Unarmed, Epic Damage Reduction I<br/>\n22: Fighter(2): Epic Damage Reduction II<br/>\n23: Fighter(3)<br/>\n24: Fighter(4): STR+1, Weapon Specialization: Unarmed, Epic Weapon Specialization: Unarmed, (STR=19)<br/>\n25: Fighter(5)<br/>\n26: Fighter(6): Epic Damage Reduction III<br/>\n27: Dwarven Defender(9): Armor Skin<br/>\n28: Dwarven Defender(10): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n29: Monk(13)<br/>\n30: Monk(14): Great Strength I, (STR=21)<br/>\n31: Monk(15)<br/>\n32: Monk(16): STR+1, (STR=22)<br/>\n33: Dwarven Defender(11): Great Strength II, (STR=23)<br/>\n34: Dwarven Defender(12)<br/>\n35: Dwarven Defender(13)<br/>\n36: Dwarven Defender(14): STR+1, Great Strength III, Epic Prowess, (STR=25)<br/>\n37: Monk(17)<br/>\n38: Monk(18)<br/>\n39: Monk(19): Great Strength IV, (STR=26)<br/>\n40: Monk(20): CON+1, (CON=22)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHitpoints: 668<br/>\nSkillpoints: 132<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 30/26/24<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +2, Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +1, Poison: +2<br/>\nBAB: 27<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 39 (melee), 30 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 26/26<br/>\nSpell Casting: <br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nDiscipline 43(51), Listen 43(43), Tumble 40(42), remaining skillpoints 6<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also play his Half-Orc Dev-Critting brother who in turn is rather resistant to Dev crit himself.

Both <em>Lawful</em>? Are we sure? Maybe their murky backstories would help? Maybe the dwarf's company of DwDs were betrayed by their less than scrupulous king and he's the only one left alive. He blames himself and has taken to the bottle and become more bristly in his outlook. And the once noble Half-Orc, sent to the monastery as the pride of his clan, returned after his training to find Oubold-Many-Arrows had paid them a visit, and his naturally barbaric nature began to take hold before he fully remembered he was now a paragon of virtue for his kind.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr some such bollocks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I like the builds!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I always liked my tales of Robin Hood as a lad, and reckoned Friar Tuck would be a great Bard/Monk/DwD (yes, I know, dramatic license with the Dwarf). Still, that's life (well, you know what I mean). I suppose I can understand it if I try to look at things with a \"that would be way too OP, it needs chaining,\" head on. I try, honestly.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile we're on whinges, I've two more bugbears with NwN. Both are well-rehearsed elsewhere, but I'll bring them out of the closet again for another airing. First, there is no good reason for Assassin to be evil (no pun intended). Neutral, maybe, but evil is a choice. Would assassinating *pick-dictator-of-choice* be evil? Second, why the bloody hell do Elves have Wizard as their favoured class? Not even any old spell-chucker, but Wizard? Surely Ranger makes more sense?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that's my rant done for this month. And I do still bite the bullet and play by the rules - it's still the best game in town, after all.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

As for rules, I had a chuckle about Hip's gnash your teeth sermon because in both PnP and NWN the rules can be easily changed... That's why we have modules and PWs.
