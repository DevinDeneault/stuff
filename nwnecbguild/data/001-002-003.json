The only information I could scrape together is from a server list site that could be (probably is) out-of-date.\u00a0 But here is a paste-over anyway:<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><em>Tornado of Souls - PW Action module created by Kell (Mirent Tusk I&amp;II).</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>ToS has been upgraded to Boware patch 1.69 and CEP 2.1. Custom spells. Customized feats. 40+ Subraces to choose from! Legendary Levels 41-60! Come explore an eye appealing well balanced world. Help defeat the evil that threatens the Prime Material Realm itself! Expansion version available late Decemeber. CEP2.1 and Latest Bio Patches required. Custom spells HAK optional. </em></span><span style=\"color:#800080\"><em><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://tornadoofsouls.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://tornadoofsouls.com/</a></em></span><br/>\n<br/>\n<em><span style=\"color:#0000FF\">IP:port - --&gt; 216.170.41.45:5121</span></em><br/>\n<br/>\n At least it seems to use some version of the CEP and the latest v1.69 rebuild. I don't understand how a Hak that effects game mechanics could be \"optional\" but as I stated, this is old data.\u00a0 The site address posted takes you to the proverbial \"Server Not Found\" page and I suspect the connection address is just as likely worthless.\u00a0 I believe the server is based in California, but even that is based on very old postings.\u00a0 This server goes way back to when the IGN Vault was a blur of activity with news releases about it and such.\u00a0 Nothing transferred onto the Neverwinter Vault, unfortunately.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, if David could fill in some of the gaps and describe the key customizations and requirements, some interest could be drummed up.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
