Their intents might be similar to this build, but I haven't looked deeply at them yet. For instance:<br/>\nMick's\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/halfling-champion-rogue-20-fighter-6-cot-14-t2354370.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Halfling Champion: Rogue 20/ Fighter 6/ CoT 14</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMy main desires in the build were TWF, Epic Dodge, and good saves. High crit range and some rogue bonus feats came along as I was laying it out. BTW...I always like Lore because I'm cheap and don't want to pay a merchant to identify stuff.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nedit: As I've been going thru refining the build, my goals and intentions have got a little clearer.<br/>\nStrong desires:<br/>\n- Rogue skills and bonus feats, especially Epic Dodge<br/>\n- BAB@lvl20 &gt; 15,\u00a0TWF, ITWF for plenty of attacks per round<br/>\n- Good to great saves (not sure I'm quite there, or if it's even possible with a rogue)<br/>\nSecondary desires<br/>\n- High crit range (hence the kukri in v1, tho I might go back to it for v3)<br/>\n<br/>\nProblems I still see:<br/>\n- Will save is lacking.<br/>\n- Couldn't squeeze another Dex+1<br/>\n- Sneak/crit immune enemies<br/>\n<br/>\nComments?
