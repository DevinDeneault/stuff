      "content": "<div>Hi Ratty_uk2011 / Stephenratcliffe809!<br/>\n<br/>\nI think your question is an excellent one.\u00a0<br/>\nRE knockdown mechanics, AC is only valuable to determine if a discipline check occurs or not.\u00a0<br/>\nIf the attack hits (either equalling the AC or higher, or rolling a natural 20) then the check occurs.<br/>\nThe subsequent discipline check and rolls do not show in the combat log. The wiki does not have information on the discipline rolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I would hazard an educated guess based on my experience, I believe it to be Attacker's AB roll (including -4AB) +1d20 + modifiers (ie size difference including improved knockdown modifier) = Discipline DC.<br/>\nThe player then rolls Discipline skill +1d20 to see if they resist the knockdown or get knocked down.<br/>\nThat way the situation where an 83 discipline character can still be knocked down by a 70 AB roll attack if the attack hits (ie a 20), the discipline roll is low and the attacker's knockdown roll is high.<br/>\nLike Web writes I always try to obtain knockdown immunity if I can and not rely on discipline.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore information however is appreciated though, I am very interested.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Orion is right about how Knockdown works: AB Roll + Size Modifier vs Discipline + 1d20, ties result in Knockdown being resisted.<br/>\nSo either WoG has changed the size modifier bonus (easily done in EE), EE has changed how Knockdown works, or the AB/Discipline used in Orion's calculations are inaccurate.<br/>\nAre you certain that your Discipline was 83? For example, if it's 83 with Bard Song but Bard Song ran out during the fight then it might be possible to get KDed on a low Discipline roll.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking at your screenshot, Razorfang has +42 AB, +38 AB with IKD. A 20 on the attack roll give a Discipline DC of 58 + Size Modifier. Assuming that Razorfang is huge and your character is medium, that's a Discipline DC of 70 (74 if your character is small). So you should be able to resist any IKD attempts from Razorfang with 69 Discipline (73 if your character is small). This is assuming that Razorfang doesn't have access to any AB buffs or STR/Discipline decreasing debuffs.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaunt causes your character to become flatfooted but Divine Might and Divine Shield don't. You may become flatfooted right after using those feats if you don't attack straight away, but you won't be flatfooted while using them.<br/>\n<br/>\nCounting flurries is possible to do, although I usually only use it for tough opponents. Fighting weak opponents with melee builds is usually just point and click, even on builds that require buffs.\u00a0If I'm playing a sneaker with a flurry\u00a0attack schedule of 2/2/1 with Haste, then I try to KD on the third flurry to get 4 Sneak Attacks instead of 3. Flurry counting is also useful for deciding when to use combat feats/modes, cast spells, or use items.</div>"

How many times do the enemies happen to completely ignore the rules of the game, surely it has happened to a\u00a0 lot of you by now, in various PW/modules. Enemies that hit you behind \"solid walls\", enemies that stand-up immediately after being knocked down, then do some weird animation of sitting-down again, only to be able to hit you back or cast spells back at you while they should just be prone! Enemies that just-won't-die, enemies that detect you through the greater sanctuary, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nTell you what, I'm not a game developer but I think that most of these come from bad detection collision in the game engine &amp; there should also be limitations due to the fracture of the game rounds, too. I did several tests in-game with the wail of the banshee, for example, my test grounds were the old open fortress of the knight Arbas. There are more than 40 creatures in there waiting for you when you activate all the location triggers. I went there, multiple times too, with my melee-Sorceress &amp; stopped the time &amp; then unload three consecutive Wails upon them. Only 7-10 creatures actually died. The \"upper\" creatures, those waiting for you in the towers &amp; the balcony did not get affected at all. They did die, only when I specifically targetted them with FoD, however. The same thing happened when later tested that with Underdark's Kuo-Toa army. I unleashed 6-7 Wails, I think, but after the first one that killed a dozen of them, only 1-2 additional creatures died. Strange, isn't it? As if, you need to kill them \"in flurries\" kinda, does this makes sense to you? Or maybe they were \"out of range\" despite the optical effect shown. Some of you might have experienced what I am talking about or have tested that themselves. The AoE spells losing their \"potency\" when repeated consecutively. Target spells, however, have none of these problems. Isaack's storm will work every time correctly, as far as I can tell. Same with FoD. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, remember it's a 20-years-old engine trying to do advanced stuff (especially with Tony's AI).\u00a0</div>"

Although Tony K AI does make for a more challenging PvM experience the AI cheating can get pretty annoying. Some of the problems are due to NWN bugs but in my experience the actual combat engine works pretty well. Combining Knockdown with other disabling effects (including itself) has always been buggy, even for players. Spells are a mixed bag, partly due to poorly written scripts and partly due to buggy functions.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, Wail has both a distance component and a\u00a0creature cap. The spell only affects creatures in a radius of 10m from the spell target, but that 10m includes height so creatures on towers or platforms may be out of reach of the spell. The creature cap (equal to your caster level) increases whenever the spell chooses a new target rather than when the spell actually attempts to kill a new target, so both the caster and allies within a 10m radius will count towards the creature cap. There is also a consistent issue with GetFirstX() functions not working properly on creatures that are standing in AOEs, although that particular bug might not affect Wail. It does mean that some AOE spells (Ice Storm, IGMS, Mass Heal, etc) will randomly fail when used on creatures standing in auras.</div>"

I do hardware not software (so don't call me an expert!), but I was in school when this game was being made. We were taught that goto statements became taboo with the rise of C as a thing that only lazy coders used as crutches stuck in their misguided thinking from the days of Pascal and Fortran. Of course that is for \"real programming\" (i.e. compiled languages) not scripting languages (where such practices are more accepted), which is what I'll assume the game designers used to stitch together game engine functions. If the gotos are in the compiled actual engine (is this what Web calls 'hardcoded'?), then I'd hypothesize that the game engine designers were also artists that picked up C/C++ in their evenings, on the job, or more likely both. Finally, I'm sure that business pressures forced upon even the most undisciplined coders lead to then rolling a 1 for their DC check when they deciding if they use such mechanisms... if such things aren't \"hardcoded\" in corporate enterprises...</div>"
