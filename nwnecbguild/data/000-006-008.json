Necromancy was chosen for the obvious winner spells in the Wizard repertoire, and Illusion for some early goodness on the front end (Color Spray and Phantasmal Killer).\u00a0 Mass Blindness is a great spell if you\u2019re in a party and all your rogue friends will love you if you keep this one memorized.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nOne of the goals in this build was to get max Intelligence (38), so that when buffed you reach (50).\u00a0 Ahh, 50\u2026.<br/>\nSilent Spell is chosen for the obvious Silenced IGMS, and is useful in general against Silenced-based opponents.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nIn concept, the Incantator Phantasmic is most like Vulcano\u2019s <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build236487.html#\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gnome Mechanic</a>:\u00a0<br/>\nOther builds similar in concept, but not quite up to the power of this one, include:\n<ul>\n<li>Max\u2019s <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/boddyknock-glinckle-Wizardard-35-fighter-2-rogue-3-t2269098.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Boddyknock Glinckle</a>\u00a0</li>\n<li>And my old <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build231822.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The War Wizard</a>:\u00a0</li>\n<li>And an honorable mention to Orion\u2019s <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-hardy-polymath-rogue-3-wizard-35-fighter-2-t2355351.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Hardy Polymath</a>:\u00a0 ( I think we both were working on different yet similar versions simultaneously.</li>\n</ul></div>"

      "content": "<div>Greetings GDL!<br/>\nBuild looks great.\u00a0<br/>\nI love how you have such a flashy writing style and terrific substance.<br/>\nHeaps of spells, fantastic spell DC from Int 38-&gt;50, two epic spell foci, rogue to invest piles of skill points into, metamagic, scribe scroll/craft wand, and very nice base HP for a DC wizard, it looks very solid indeed, the type of build I'd love to play, 40 to saves against spells is fabulous.\u00a0<br/>\nYou clearly had too many skill points to spend if you have found a way to craft deadly gas traps with 100% success (DC 45 with no Take 20) into the build, it is a very flashy feature, well done :)\u00a0<br/>\nWith Set Trap 38(41) you are so close to being able to set Epic traps outside of combat with 45 modified with an empowered Cat's Grace spell, maybe just by adding a few points you can add another flashy and powerful feature, not that you need more<br/>\nAlso I thought there should be a 20% XP penalty at level 39 and 40 from Ranger 1 onwards.\u00a0<br/>\nI also believe you wrote you maxed discipline but didn't include it in the the post<br/>\nI think it makes little difference to the whole picture, I think I'm searching for a suggestion or improvement that doesn't really change of the core substance, which is a very solid and flashy build<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps, thanks for taking the effort to post this up</div>"
