      "content": "<div>I recently was gifted NWN:EE by a friend so I could join his group of dnd friends to play through all 3 campaigns, and have been looking for a build that incorporates halfling and weaponmaster. So far the only build I've really been able to find is <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/roguishly-critical-halfling-master-ftr11-wm28-ro1-t2354408.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">roguishly-critical-halfling-master-ftr1 ... 54408.html</a> but I prefer using exotic weapons like katana or bastard swords. Can anyone update this guide or have a new one with similar weapons/feats? It would be greatly appreciated as I don't have much dnd/nwn knowledge yet.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hello Sucy, and welcome!<br/>\n<br/>\nCutting quickly to the chase, there are a couple of issues here. Halflings are only wee things, so will have to wield katanas or bastard swords 2-handed (much as Theophilus Fist's build focus on scimitar does), thus impacting their Armour Class as they can't use a shield. What scimitar brings is a better chance of attaining a critical hit than either of the two you mention. Also, you'd need to take Exotic Weapon Proficiency as a feat, and it's hard to see what you might sacrifice here - particularly given that you already don't have Blind Fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second thing - which might actually be of help here - is that if you're only going to be playing the OC, SoU and HotU (although you shouldn't play the latter 2 from the end of the OC, as SoU is also designed to be started at level 1, and you'll be ending the OC at around level 17/18, so it will be intensely dull - I know, I've done it myself) you won't go beyond level 28 (the aforementioned 17/18 in the OC). That means you won't reach Devastating Critical, so you won't need rubbish feats like Great Cleave, thereby giving a bit more freedom in your pre-epic feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, should you and your friends wish to go all the way to level 40 and fully realise your builds, we're more than happy to give a recommendation or two. I'll confess, though - and I know it's not a weapon master - I'd be tempted to point you to one of Mick's builds here...<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/halfling-champion-rogue-20-fighter-6-cot-14-t2354370.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Halfling Champion</a></div>",

I just really like the halfling race and the idea of using a one handed weapon as a two handed, always been a fan of niche builds and aesthetically it's just up my alley. I was trying to piece together a build myself using stuff I've found here as a sort of guide, but I'd figure I should ask as well so I don't become a huge burden in our group's playthrough. From what I understand I think we do plan on going to 40 eventually, everyone is just working out their classes before we start tomorrow or the weekend. I will take a look at the build you posted as well!</div>"

I'm going to take a guess and say that using bastardswords/katanas are just not really viable or feasible? If that's the case then I will just use the scimitar builds I think, as it's probably the closest to those aesthetically and I really liked the way bastardswords looked in nwn from what I've seen. Also will remember, was wondering what Hin was referring to every time I looked through halfling threads, ahah.</div>"
