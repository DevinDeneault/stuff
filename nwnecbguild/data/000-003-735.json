I did consider it initially but I can have a look at the Assassin 2 idea again to increase SR by one, extra monk speed I believe and get earlier uncanny dodge at the expense of 1d6 sneak, 12 skill points and requiring to be evil, but I wonder if the current configuration is better for a bit of extra damage in that first flurry, getting balance right is tricky between to the two.

I think you knew I can figure how to solve this one<img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" />.<br/>\n<br/>\nEasy solution. Dump starting Wis to 8, drop Int to 12 put starting Str to 18, drop two improved spell resistance feats for great strengths. 2 base AB added right there. One would get Dev crit earlier at level 24. Lose some AC and -2 will save and 43 skill points and 4 spell resistance. I think that's an ok tradeoff.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI then hit the benchmark of Mithdradates's average warrior AB of 40. Hooray for me! Add buffs from UMD / good weapon, can pump the AB up to a reasonable level.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThat last attack is going to rarely hit against comparable opponents, likely on a 20 and likely never crit. This is a 3/4 BAB build really, hitting an AB of 40 is pretty good considering. The main advantage of that 4th attack is going to be the two hit flurry which can be achieved by haste. If I include more levels of fighter pre-epic for 1 BAB and that extra attack, then I struggle to fit in all the epic level feats (Overwhelming Critical, Devastating Critical, EWF, EP) plus as many improved spell resistance feats as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are higher AB Kensai builds, for example, <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/whirlwind-of-steel-monk-25-ftr-8-wm-7-t2350043.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Valerfor's Whirlwind of Steel</a>\u00a0which takes 15 levels of Fighter/WM, AB is 43 in that circumstance but spell resistance is much lower, 35 in comparison. I'm looking for a much more spell resistant Kensai with Dev Crit, and this is achieved by pumping Monk 35+. I'd be looking at as close to 50/50 against a pure caster with epic spell penetration to avoid sacrificing other capabilities.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>I think you recognize this yourself by taking WF in Unarmed. Why not stick with that? You get the UBAB progression and d20 damage fists at level 16, as well as cutting through DR at Ki Strike 1, 2 and 3 (levels 10, 13 and 16). Admittedly not much, but it doesn't hurt. It also frees up 2 feats. I appreciate that scimitar is more crit-friendly, but that makes no difference if you're just waving it in the wind.</div></blockquote>\nSometimes once you have played so many builds you just feel the need to play a dev critting Spell Resistant Kensai Stag? Just a bit different to the usual punch fest/dual kama fest monks tend to be.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore are fists more optimal here? Not sure. I believe they are different weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nFists - 1d20 damage, innate +1-3 enchantment (to essential pierce Ghostly Visage / Ethereal Visage, some other enemies), Crit threat range 19-20 (10%), 5 APR-7APR (flurry of blows/haste) -&gt; ?keen gloves do they exist<br/>\nScimitar - 1d6 damage, weapon can be buffed with keen weapon/GMW/Bless Weapon/Flame Weapon/Dark Fire scrolls with UMD, frees up the glove slot for magical bonuses, Crit threat\u00a0range 12-20 (45%) or 15-20 (30%), 3-4 APR (depending if haste is active)<br/>\nGreatsword - 2d6 damage, 1.5 str damage, buffable weapon, freed up glove slot, Crit threat\u00a0range 15-20 (30%) or 17-20 (20%), 3-4 APR<br/>\n<br/>\nReally in terms of weapon choice, I thought a build that aims to assassinate with dev crit would want a weapon with a wide crit range.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought therefore the keen scimitar is the no brainer for assassinations. Kukri would likely come close second just for being a small weapon making one more likely to be disarmed. Rapier would tie with kukri just because it isn't a slashing weapon and you can't use keen weapon on it, but keen rapiers exist in the toolset for sure.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nDo the extra attacks from fists (3 APR vs 2 APR) in the first flurry make it more optimal? This is the stats for the first flurry.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n- You get two attacks in your first flurry with haste with a keen scimitar giving you a 70% (1-0.55^2) chance in your first flurry of rolling something in the threat range.\u00a0<br/>\n- Keen Greatsword hasted gets two attacks in the first flurry, this grants a 51% (1-0.70^2) chance in your first flurry of rolling something in the threat range.\u00a0<br/>\n- Fists get 3 attacks in the first flurry with both Flurry of Blows/Haste active. This grants a 27% (1 - 0.9^3) chance of rolling the crit range in the first flurry (3 attacks). If Keen gloves exist, then the crit range in the first flurry is 39% (1 - 0.85^3) with Flurry of Blows &amp; haste active. Flurry of Blows will lower AB by 2.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway the character is almost tripling the crit chance (70% vs 27%) in the first flurry with a keen scimitar with haste active, which is the point of the build - assassinate with dev crit going through all those crazy Epic Warding/Premonition shields etc etc then get the hell out before you receive the Time Stop/Mass Haste/Time Stop/Mord/Time Stop/IGMS/Time Stop/Bigby treatment hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of the AB fists vs sword, if the goal is damage, I think fists win, if the goal is dev crit, then I think scimitar wins<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn't crossclass Spellcraft because with such high SR + spell mantles there are lots of defenses already.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing that is going to kill this guy is being surprised by a Bigby's hand (which is a non-DC spell ) which gets through his innate spell resistance, improved knockdown (equip knockdown immunity if possible) or dev crit (this is your achilles heel), death attack before he gets mind immunity (that grants paralysis immunity too right?) or petrify (everyone will roll a 1 eventually, ranged weapons are best here).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nHence I valued the detection skills. If you see em before they see you, you can always reposition with your +110-120 monk speed, unless of course, they are monks themselves and somehow faster than you which is unlikely :) Instant death spells can be countered by a death immunity belt or a death ward scroll from UMD, and you are mind immune so the will save might not matter as much, so spell craft seemed low value, certainly helpful for sure, but 40 points in spot is better against those sneaky assassins that catch you.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway that decision is all academic now that I'll drop Int to 12 and lose 43 skill points, I'll need to drop Spot anyway, but it would have been nice against those annoying HiPS'ers<br/>\n<br/>\nI also considered other races, Dwarf and Half-Orc but human looked more stylish to me, plenty more human kensai portraits on the internet (feel free to let me know if you find any good dwarven or half-orc ones) to upload into the game with the ConvertPortrait command in the NWN console<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway thanks for the feedback. I'll work on including Zanithar's suggestion for Assassin 2 adding 1 SR and Stag's suggestion for more AB and edit it into the main post. Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Edit:</strong>\u00a0actually I can include spot if I drop dex to 12 and put Int to 14 but I'm not sure that would be worth it, I'm gonna mull over it a bit<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
