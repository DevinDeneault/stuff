      "content": "<div>This was another fun build idea I had, utilising the concept of making the favored class low to avoid multiclass exp penalties.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a halfling Druid / Cleric Zen Archer with a touch of rogue.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has dual divine spell books both up to level 9 spells so you can cast lots and lots of summons buffed by the Druid class bonus to them.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's got rogue skills for shortbow proficiency, a little sneak attack, lots of useful rogue class skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleric domains trickery and travel. WoG'ers will be pleased to note the new halfling deity implemented can take these domains.<br/>\n<br/>\nDruids get empowered summons on WoG but if you take this build elsewhere you will want animal domain for empowered summons and trickery domain for invis.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas 350hp.\u00a0Base AB 40 ranged. With Rapid Shot / Divine Power / Haste you can do 6 attacks per round (hurrah!)<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually at level 39 one can turn into a dragon! (take an extra rogue skill dump mid epic if you don't want this by going Cleric 17 / Druid 17 / Rogue 6, you can see the huge skill dump at the end)<br/>\n<br/>\nNo multi class exp penalties either (hurray!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I thought I would post this for your review and commentary.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly one cleric/druid/rogue in the ECB archives I could find (maybe you know of more?), it isn't legal any more with the change to dragon shape:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build180764.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dragon Slinger v2.0\u00a0</a>rogue 10 / cleric 15 / druid 15\u00a0(human)\u00a0by CrispyCritter<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Rogue(5), Cleric(17), Druid(18), Halfling\nAny neutral\nSTR: 10\nCON: 12\nINT: 14\n\n01: Rogue(1): Point Blank Shot\n03: Cleric(2): Weapon Focus: Shortbow\n05: Druid(2)\n07: Druid(3)\n09: Cleric(4): Rapid Shot\n11: Druid(5)\n13: Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}\n15: Druid(6): Extend Spell\n17: Druid(7)\n19: Cleric(8)\n21: Cleric(9): Epic Weapon Focus: Shortbow\n23: Druid(10)\n25: Druid(11)\n27: Cleric(12): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=24)\n29: Druid(13)\n31: Druid(14)\n33: Cleric(15): Great Wisdom III, (WIS=28)\n35: Druid(16)\n37: Druid(17)\n39: Druid(18): Dragon Shape\n\nSkillpoints: 256\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8, Fear: +4\nAB (max, naked): 27 (melee), 40 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Cleric(9),Druid(9)\n\n\n01: Disable Trap(4), Open Lock(1), Search(4), Set Trap(4), Spot(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(15),\u00a0\n03: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(12),\u00a0\n05: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(20),\u00a0\n07: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(26),\u00a0\n09: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(2), Save(4),\u00a0\n11: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(12),\u00a0\n13: Disable Trap(5), Search(5), Spot(5), Tumble(5), UMD(5),\u00a0\n15: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n17: Concentration(1), Save(11),\u00a0\n19: Concentration(1), Save(19),\u00a0\n21: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(2),\u00a0\n23: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(2), Save(3),\u00a0\n25: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(9),\u00a0\n27: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(13),\u00a0\n29: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(21),\u00a0\n31: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(27),\u00a0\n33: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(31),\u00a0\n35: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(39),\u00a0\n37: Save(48),\u00a0\n39: Save(58),\u00a0</details>\n<strong>Edit:</strong>\u00a0during playtesting I have dropped stealth for other rogue skills and to pump spell craft up for +8 to saves.

I can't see anything in the NWN Wiki that Druids get stronger summons.<br/>\nI'll have to include your suggestion if that's the case for players not playing WoG.</div>"
