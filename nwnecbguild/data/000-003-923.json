      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Last year I've been playing on a very popular PW and I've become increasingly frustrated. Here's my problem:<br/>\nEnd-game bosses have somewhere around 85AC and 100AB, as well as occasionally stuff like OnHit Harm, OnHit Dispel and are usually plentiful. Usually they are also equipped with lots of Damage Reductions, so they take all day to kill. The only way to clear up end-game areas is a team of one WM-killer and one DD-tank. But, I have become obsessed with the idea of solo-ing those areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've tried most every pure build I can find. Wizard can sometimes win the fight with lots of scrolls, timestop, etc, etc. But, my wish is to find some kind of melee character that really can kick arse. Is there a build with the AC of a DEX-fighter, the hitting power of a STR-based RDD/Barbarian, the toughness of a Dwarven Defender that I can use? I understand there has to be compromises, so priorities are: 1. Massive overpowered damage. 2. Ability to survive lots of magic and damage raining down. 3. Anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are plenty of treasure in this PW, you can create a +20 weapon with 2d10+2d10 damage bonuses and 2d12 massive crits, so you can actually do some damage. The question is more, who will do the damage? Any wild ideas? I can see some interesting builds in the lvl40-area, but which should I choose?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny assistance is very much appreciated.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

A Monk / Fighter / Rogue would give you Uncanny Dodge, Epic Dodge, UMD for scrolls, and sneak attacks, but a rather low AB. A Monk / Fighter / WM would lose all those Rogue benefits (except you would still have Tumble from Monk), but your AB would be much higher and you would have more critical hits with a higher multiplier.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Okay, this is a tough case no matter how you look at it. <br/>\nMy first answer to something like that would be a Sorceress as she is probably the only one that can solo anything with enough preparation &amp; knowledge of the game. That has been the case since the invention of DnD &amp; it ever will be. the thing, of course, is that you do not want such a build &amp; I understand this completely, so let's see what else can we do.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing a tank \"MMO terminology, but let's roll with it for the moment\" doesn't actually prevent you from dealing some good damage yourself. Here is the thing, Magaiti's Dwarven Defender is a weapon master in addition to that (search the 40's section) and he has as high an AB as he could get for such a defensive build. His total (mundane) AB is 43, that makes it 43 +6 +20= 69AB for your PW. With flanking assumed (+2) he will be able to actually hit the hardest Bosses although no so consistently as you might like. His crits will hurt though! (X4 multiplier).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother case could be made for Andariel (Bard 5/ RDD 15/ PM 20). I have her listed with a Scythe but if you take a medium weapon &amp; shield, she has a super-high AC of 47 with mundane gear. Assuming +10 defensive items for your PW fully equipped she would have 102 AC. She can go higher than that with a Bard's blessings (because she isn't maxed on her dodge AC) but let's assume personal buffs only. You see that even this isn't gonna cut it but perhaps it will stop the Bosses from power-attacking her. Then she is completely immune to critical hits, that should help a lot for actually surviving the damn thing. She is strength-based (54 Strength, buffed) so her damage should be alright, although she is gonna use a one-handed weapon &amp; she is no weapon master herself. <br/>\n<br/>\nArcane archers are another choice, although I know nothing for the Bow &amp; Arrow enchantments on your server. They have the highest AB from all builds though &amp; are able to fully attack from a distance, so that should help. <br/>\n<br/>\nFrom discussing this thing, the obvious choice that comes to mind is team-work. I think that Bosses &amp; high-level mobs are this way in order to force co-operation. <br/>\nGood luck.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'm not sure on exactly what immunities they have (no invulnerabilities...), but in general they are not high on Sonic/Acid/Divine resists. Magick damage always works. (That's the reason for me always going for WF:Battleaxe, you can find a battleaxe with 2d10 magic damage that you can modify.)<br/>\nDev crit, as mentioned above is nerfed to 35% extra damage, so basically, just barely worth it. Sneak not working, most spells I have no clue, sorry.<br/>\nArcane Archer might actually be worth trying.

I'm currently trying a wizard, but I've always been partial to sorceresses.<br/>\nMagaiti's Dwarven Defender is not found in the 40's section. It's mentioned, but I can't find it. Still, I already have a DD that can go toe-to-toe with most monsters. The trouble with her is that the No2 Boss (second to last) regenerates faster than I can hit him since I only hit with 20.<br/>\nAndariel seems interesting (or, less diplomatically, really, really weird). I have only ever once played a PM, so why not try again. I'll take a closer look on her.<br/>\nAA might be viable, but I'm not sure (the areas are very crowded with lots of mobs in small rooms, so, not sure).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I'm looking is because teamwork is hard for me to arrange. I play at the wrong times. At peaks, there are like 30 people online, but when I'm playing we've been down to 5-6 players, so it's not easy to form a team.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
