      "content": "<div>so with the old builds from comcast lost into the ether (though if you know what you're searching for it's all cached), I thought I post a Str-based PM fighter to the lvl 40 section. \u00a0Posting here for any feedback prior.<br/>\n<br/>\n This was based on Grizz's two PM builds, Myrmidon Eternal and Charnel Lord. \u00a0I always felt there was a bit too much PM, which led to not enough AB (42 and 40 respectively). \u00a0So I give you this:<br/>\n<br/>\n Fighter(20), Bard(4), Pale Master(16), Human<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 18 (34)<br/>\n DEX: 10<br/>\n CON: 14<br/>\n WIS: 8<br/>\n INT: 14<br/>\n CHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n Human: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n 01: Fighter(1): Luck of Heroes, Power Attack, Cleave<br/>\n 02: Fighter(2): Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br/>\n 03: Bard(1): Toughness<br/>\n 04: Fighter(3): STR+1, (STR=19)<br/>\n 05: Fighter(4): Knockdown<br/>\n 06: Fighter(5): Weapon Specialization: Scimitar<br/>\n 07: Fighter(6): Expertise<br/>\n 08: Bard(2): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n 09: Fighter(7): Iron Will<br/>\n 10: Fighter(8): Improved Knockdown<br/>\n 11: Fighter(9)<br/>\n 12: Fighter(10): STR+1, Lightning Reflexes, Improved Critical: Scimitar, (STR=21)<br/>\n 13: Fighter(11)<br/>\n 14: Fighter(12): Blind Fight<br/>\n 15: Fighter(13): Great Fortitude<br/>\n 16: Fighter(14): STR+1, Great Cleave, (STR=22)<br/>\n 17: Fighter(15)<br/>\n 18: Bard(3): OPEN FEAT (take SF or WF: ranged weapon or Lingering Song)<br/>\n 19: Pale Master(1)<br/>\n 20: Pale Master(2): STR+1, (STR=23)<br/>\n 21: Fighter(16): Great Strength I, Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar, (STR=24)<br/>\n 22: Fighter(17)<br/>\n 23: Fighter(18): Epic Prowess<br/>\n 24: Pale Master(3): STR+1, Great Strength II, {Darkvision}, (STR=26)<br/>\n 25: Pale Master(4)<br/>\n 26: Pale Master(5)<br/>\n 27: Pale Master(6): Great Strength III, (STR=27)<br/>\n 28: Pale Master(7): STR+1, (STR=28)<br/>\n 29: Pale Master(8)<br/>\n 30: Pale Master(9): Great Strength IV, (STR=29)<br/>\n 31: Pale Master(10)<br/>\n 32: Pale Master(11): STR+1, (STR=30)<br/>\n 33: Pale Master(12): Great Strength V, (STR=31)<br/>\n 34: Pale Master(13): Epic Energy Resistance: Acid I \u00a0(or Fire)<br/>\n 35: Pale Master(14)<br/>\n 36: Pale Master(15): STR+1, Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor, (STR=32)<br/>\n 37: Pale Master(16): Epic Spell: Epic Warding<br/>\n 38: Bard(4)<br/>\n 39: Fighter(19): Great Strength VI, (STR=33)<br/>\n 40: Fighter(20): STR+1, Epic Weapon Specialization: Scimitar, (STR=34)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 463<br/>\n Skillpoints: 223<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 28/23/21<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8<br/>\n BAB: 28<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 44 (melee), 29 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 28/39<br/>\n Spell Casting:\u00a0<br/>\n Alignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\n Disable Trap 1(3), Discipline 43(55), Open Lock 1(1), Perform 10(9), Spellcraft 41(43), Taunt 41(40), Tumble 40(40), UMD 41(40), remaining skillpoints 3<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n So you get good HP, nice AB of 44, Discipline, Spellcraft, Taunt, Tumble, UMD, 13 pts AC better than standard strength-based tumble-dump build (+10 PM, +5 EMA dodge, -2 no armor skin), hearty strength damage + WS/EWS, and pretty much every general combat feat worth taking (IKD, BF, IC, expertise+taunt combo, great cleave, room for disarm/imp disarm if you want it). \u00a0You even have a baby bard song for 40 rounds per day (60 if Lingering Song taken). \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Some options:<br/>\n - Take two-handed weapon. \u00a0If so, you'll probably want to swap out one of the saving throw feats for disarm and take improved disarm at 18. \u00a0<br/>\n - Dev Crit - swap out 2 Great Str for OC and DC. \u00a0<br/>\n - on a high magic PW, EWS may not be worth it (I've played on worlds where you can get all 12 damage bonuses on weapons). \u00a0If the 4 damage is not worth it in your environment, you can either A. take Armor Skin for another 2 AC or B. move two fighter levels from epic to pre-epic in place of the two PM levels, bumping your AB to 45 (at that point either take disarm/imp disarm or two SF taunt and discipline). \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n comments/feedback before I post it to the level 40 section?</div>"

      "content": "<div>I like this kind of builds. The crit immunity granted by PM cries out for dev crit. And you have gone half the way already by taking Great cleave. <br/>\n Pre epic I would have taken expertise earlier, perhaps at lvl 2, WF at lvl 3, WS at lvl 5 and KD at lvl 7 when you start to get 2 attacks per round. I would drop one feat to be able to take the disarm feats, either Lightning reflexes or Great fortitude. The fort saves are not quite as important as usual in a dev crit build, because you have crit immunity from PM.<br/>\n In epic levels you are feat starved if you want to retain AB44 with 6 Great strength feats. One solution is to make a F24 Ba6 PM10 build. That will give you EWF, EP, EWS, Dev crit  and AS, but you lose EMA and EW.</div>",
