But that feels so... common...\n</div></blockquote>\nValerfor is correct in that Lasting Impression requires you to be an Epic Bard (ie lvl 21+), and Mighty Rage requires Epic Barbarian (ie lvl 21+), having both feats is impossible as there are only 40 levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said I think your class combo Barb 20/Bard 16 could work, but you may need to go Barb 21/Bard 16/other class 3 to access Mighty rage. I understand Bard Song at level 16 is pretty reasonable, and you may want curse song as well.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nJust remember having a whilst a +4 strength item and mighty rage will reach the Str cap, using a Bull's Strength potion or spell/scroll from Bard plus mighty rage will also help you reach the Str cap as well, using both rages is probably unnecessary<br/>\n<br/>\nThe remaining levels could be prestige classes (which avoid 20% exp penalty) such as CoT for extra feats and saves, Assassin for death attacks / use poison / skills, or Blackguard (which would provide Heavy Armor Proficiency and 1d6 sneak attack, use poison and stackable Bull's strength), or if you can live with the 20% exp penalty (which I understand is less of a problem on PWs where monsters respawn) then Fighter / Rogue are also good options.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you are aware of Kamiryn's character builder calculator? It is an excellent tool to help with building.\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/other/tool/characterbuildcalculator-cbc\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://neverwintervault.org/project/nw ... ulator-cbc</a> I have found it very helpful as a tool. Initially I started building without it (creating the builds in-game with Pretty Good Character Creator Module) and it was very painfully slow<br/>\n<br/>\nI think your next step should be to settle the classes you want to use, and how many levels of each you would like, the feats you want to take remembering non humans get 14 general feats, the skills you want to take etc, attribute distribution...<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope my response helps<br/>\n<br/>\nAddit: I think you've written two more responses while I've been typing this - I can sense your excitement! Bard gives you UMD, Spellcraft AND Tumble as class skills... plus more...</div>"

I can't really come up with something that works better than Barb/Bard/RDD which feels so cheesy. I even dusted off my Bard8/RDD10/WM22 in desperation (AB/AC: 50/25). Oh, well. I guess I'll go play with the Barbarian/Bard/RDD then. It's yet another RDD combo. I wish I could come up with an interesting barbarian build without going back to the RDD.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Yes, that's the correct choice (although it can be done, barely, with other classes) and Barb 28/ Bard 2/ Rdd 10 will offer you the most epic feats. If you don' mind the exp penalty then you could start the same build (use your own or HOOD by Max) but using Dwarf, thus potentially gain +2 Strength at the top-end. And yes, Rdd IS cheese &amp; that's why it's everywhere, but when you have so high expectations from a build (Dev. Crit &amp; EDR 3 &amp; MR &amp; 45AB) well, nothing else will suffice.\u00a0</div>"
