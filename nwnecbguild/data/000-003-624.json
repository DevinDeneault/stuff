      "content": "<div>Hello all!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never made a build before so im not super sure how to go about this. What I am looking for is maximum number of attacks per round with as much AC and AB as I can get. I chose monk because it is my favorite class to play. I was thinking of doing a Dex based Kama monk and Wis based as well so that I can benefit from the no max dex of robes and the monk AC. I was thinking Ranger because they can maintain a decent AB bonus and they get two weapon fighting for free. I also chose Champion of Torm for saves and a little bit of spell casting. But I would like to not worry to much about spell casting and just be able to hold my own against most think as much as I can. I believe max enchantment on WoG is +6. There is no alignment changes and no race restrictions either. Also I want to use Kamas.</div>"
