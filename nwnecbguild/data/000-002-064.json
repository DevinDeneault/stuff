This is no longer the case in the Enhanced Edition. For example, a human 6th-level fighter/4th-level paladin/7th-level champion of Torm will have two non-favored base classes and one favored prestige class. The non-favored base class levels differ by more than one, so there is a -20% XP penalty. \"</div></blockquote>\n\nSo this is something that needs to be mentioned until (if) it gets fixed.</div>"
