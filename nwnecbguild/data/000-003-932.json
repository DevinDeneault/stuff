      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hello! First time I post in these forums, though I've been checking it for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I started playing in a new server, but I'm having a hard time trying to figure out what to play and how to build it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy request, if possible, would look like...<br/>\n<br/>\n1) PvM<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Max level: 20<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Restrictions:<br/>\n\u00a0 <br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0 - Minimum 3 levels of base class before or at level 10. Example: (6 ranger, 4 warrior) or (3 ranger, 3 barbarian, 4 warrior)<br/>\n<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0 - Roleplay server. That means no less than 10 Wis, Cha, Dex...<br/>\n<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0 - Minimum 5 levels of prestige classes before level 20. Example: (8 fighter, 3 bard, 9 RDD)<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Low magic server. <br/>\n<br/>\n5) Melee preference. Don't really care about class nor alignments. Same goes for weapons. Though I'd rather play an STR char, but not a big deal if it's DEX based. <br/>\n<br/>\n6) Class changes:<br/>\n<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0 - Assassin gets HiPS at level 8.<br/>\n<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0 - Ranger hit point dice changed to d8 but gets 6+int skills. Also gets ITWF at level 6 instead of 9.<br/>\n<br/>\n\u00a0\u00a0 - RDD hit point dice changed to d12.<br/>\n<br/>\n7) Spellcasting. I've always loved to idea of playing a warrior who could also use magic. There's even a prestige class in this server that's basically that. But tbh it's not a big deal if it won't have any spellcasting, or if it's cleric/druid/whatever. Also, UMD is available to all classes, so even a warrior could spend skill points in it (2:1 ratio). <br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, thank you very much for reading and helping. Also sorry if I made some grammar mistakes, English is not my native language. <br/>\n<br/>\nHave a great day!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Bard/AArcher/ Asn. I would have to do some maths on the bard combos to find the breaking point. You will probably need either Ranger or Fighter to dual wield properly in there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a 20 lvl environment, going heavy bard could be great. 14-16, then Fighter, RDD, Blackguard or CoT. Your song is a huge asset in such a low lvl environ.<br/>\n<br/>\nSent fra min SM-G950F via Tapatalk<br/>\n<br/>\n<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Not something for beginners, though.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Eventhough the class sure looks awesome, I don't really like playing Bards... I don't know why, it just doesn't feel exciting to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like what Mick said about a melee mage. It sure does cover a lot of things I asked for (mainly because of magic + weapons usually means versatility).<br/>\n<br/>\nWill give it a try building a melee mage and see if I could come up with something interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again, you all guys gave me a lot of ideas, really appreciate that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a great day!!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
