      "content": "<div>Greetings and well met. Kinda new to these forums and very glad to meet you all, since I ve been in love with this game for almost 20 years now and I ve recently discovered that the experience can be enriched with all the wonderful modules available.<br/>\n<br/>\nI own both Enhanced Edition and Diamond Edition, but unfortunately a lot of old modules are not yet 'enhanced' vor the Enhanced Edition. I have some questions<br/>\n1) are there mods to enhance the Diamond edition of the game (which don t interfere with other modules) ? Like bringing in some QoL adjustments similar to the ones in the Enhanced Edition (e.g. bigger UI / Fonts). <br/>\n2) Is it possible to also play NWN Diamond in borderless window?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions are more than welcome. Cheers.</div>"

Almost done. It is a nice module (playing it on EE) and I've only encountered 1-2 minor bugs fixed with reloads of previous saves. I must say, though, that I've really enjoyed A dance with rogues beofre it (ignorig the controversial parts). Was blown away of the whole way that module was designed.<br/>\nI am aiming for the Prophet series soon, but that one requires the Diamond edition (whih is why I was asking for ways to 'enhance' the UI in that one - maybe even find a borderless window mod)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>"
