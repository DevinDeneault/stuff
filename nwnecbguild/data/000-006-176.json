It makes the selection of that all-important tertiary class more open-ended.\u00a0 But honestly, I have never considered a barbarian as a useful option.\u00a0 It's not bad at all, if you are selective about the environment.\u00a0 It will have its greatest advantage playing where ability caps are not easy to reach via items.\u00a0 Otherwise, rage's value is neutralized and the commitment to all those barb levels amount to one goal only... accessing Terrifying Rage.\u00a0 So... choose the right situation and this combination is fun and dominant to play.\u00a0 The high Hit Dice of barb forms a cushion that buffers damage and the increased speed is a welcome benefit, especially in early levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n Generally, the first few levels are the toughest since the DEX AB is only effective for range weapons.\u00a0 No Weapon Finesse because it would be only a temporary, low-level fix for a STR-based melee focus in a feat-starved build.\u00a0\u00a0 DEX is the ability pumped because the preferred shape (RL) and secondary shape (Epic minotaur) both use the native DEX level and override both STR &amp; CON.\u00a0 Refer to my \"Leveling Tips\" section for a leg up on how I managed its progress in a customizable, scalable training environment.\u00a0 I have not tried playing this on Aielund and most likely, never will.\u00a0 I leave that to CosmicTomato and his partners in crime.<br/>\n<br/>\n PROS <ul><li>Typical shifter repertoire allows the toon to deal with many sorts of enemies by sheer shifting versatility rather than hunting down items to imbue the needed properties.</li> <li>Risen Lord scythe criticals are one of the highest damage attacks, second only to a scythemaster crits or those alignment-dependent smiters.</li> <li>A raging RL is nothing to sneeze at.\u00a0 Even with the reduced AC, no opposed crits land and only bludgeoning attacks penetrate the damage immunities.</li> <li>Terrifying Rage is lots of fun to have in the repertoire with all those stunned NPC standing there waiting to get chopped up. But I can't decide which form is more suitable.\u00a0 The RL looks just plain evil and the Minotaur looks just plain hungry.\u00a0 Maxed Intimidate sets the naked DC at 53 - 62.\u00a0 55 - 64 with the effects of an Eagle pot or three.</li> <li>4 APR!\u00a0 The one thing a barb tertiary does accomplish is 4 attacks per round with a nasty scythe... very atypical for shifter builds that usually integrate Tumble classes instead ending with 3 APR.</li> <li>What doesn't an RL need to be concerned about?\u00a0 Crits/sneaks (including WMs and DevCrit attacks), death magic, level/ability drain or negative energy damage, mind-control, paralysis, poison/disease and petrification (an appearance bug, but hey, we'll take it!).</li> <li>Virtual Party fun.\u00a0 Between the animal companion and a dire wolf/spider as party members, this RL will not get lonely and can play the hero by saving his pals from sure destruction.</li> </ul>\n CONS <ul><li>Tough to level 1 through 7.\u00a0 A designed Dexer without finesse has a hard time registering hits in melee.\u00a0 A barb holding a sling or bow just looks silly but hits.\u00a0 Thankfully, it doesn't last that long and the payoff makes it worth the suffering.</li> <li>Pre-epic has few rage attempts.\u00a0 The real raging starts after Risen Lord/Epic Minotaur is available at Level 24.\u00a0 Then things get more manageable and fun.</li> <li>What does an RL need to be concerned about?\u00a0 Being turned, positive energy attacks (i.e. healing). High-STR bludgeoning attacks, all traps... yes, even Negative Traps (won't drain but will cause damage), IGMS, some Bigby's, some Epic Spells.</li> <li>Epic Minotaur must be used vs. Clerics and high-level Pallies and for emergency healing.</li> <li>Belt slot worthless.\u00a0 This is not unique to this build but I am still registering it as a weakness nonetheless.\u00a0 I use belts that increase strength while in native form just for carrying capacity.\u00a0 Once shifted, carrying heavy loot is no longer a concern.</li> <li>RL is impossible to heal without a friendly cleric (or a misguided enemy cleric) standing by casting negative energy spells on it.\u00a0 The vampiric weapon helps a bit, though</li> </ul><table class=\"post_content_table\"><tbody><tr><td>- -

Combine Expertise with Wyrmling breath for AoE damage.\u00a0 Use elementally-protected companion and summons 1-3 as needed.\u00a0 Toggle wyrmling breath element types according to enemy resistance/immunity (eg. Greenie acid vs. shadow fiends). Always scout while invisible (pots) for effortless recon and cheese kills.\u00a0 All wyrmies are True Seers so can recon stealthers well.<br/>\n<br/>\n ---- from this point on, weapon enhancements/props merge into shape ----<br/>\n<br/>\n Lvl 13 - 23: Minotaur: Use enhanced companion as needed (Barkskin, Fang buff). Use taunts to increase attack. Use wyrmling breath attacks in expertise mode where highest AC is needed. \u00a0<br/>\n Lvl 24-40: Risen Lord, Epic Minotaur:\u00a0 Shift to Epic Minotaur when turning is threatened or to heal.\u00a0 Companion/summons no longer needed.\u00a0 Use whirlwind (carefully!) among dense flankers.\u00a0 Use Minotaur's KD vs. IGMS/Bigby mages. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nReference/Comments<br/>\n<br/>\n Note: Attack and AC values reported on the Avatar Screen ignore the size modifier (which can be verified by combat debugging mode).\u00a0 The following adjustments should be applied to the values show on the screen:\u00a0 brown bear -1, wyrmling +1, minotaur -1, Risen Lord/panther - no change.\u00a0 The same adjustment must be manually applied to stealth and detection values shown on the skill list screen (only detection applies for this build).<br/>\n<br/>\n Note:\u00a0 Haste and Divine Power show examples of free attacks. <em>\"Free attacks applied to users of creature weapons are implemented as additional attacks applied at end of the attack progression and continue the same BAB progression rate as the class dictates (-3 for monk, -5 for all other classes), ignoring the normal \"full base attack\" effect.\"\u00a0</em>\u00a0 This mechanism effects all unarmed shapes like wyrmling or dragon. Example (hypothetical):\u00a0 Minotaur and wyrmling both have a non-hasted AB of +20/+15/+10/+5.\u00a0 The shifter unmorphs, equips Boots of Speed and attacks with both shapes.\u00a0 The minotaur's revised AB is now +20/+15/+10/+5/+20.\u00a0 The wymling's is +20/+15/+10/+5/+0.<br/>\n<br/>\n Note:\u00a0 One caution I will pass on because I succumbed myself by accident... Be CERTAIN to unmorph before leveling up, else assigning skill points may not go as planned for some reason.\u00a0 Must have something to do with appearance but I lost some skill points along the way until I started paying closer attention.\u00a0 The schedule listed in this build should work fine as long as your toon obeys this rule.<br/>\n<br/>\n Comment<br/>\n Brb/Dru/Shf combo and AC:\u00a0 Typically, a Tumble class like Monk or Rogue would be used for the tertiary.\u00a0 This change is evidenced by the -4 Tumble AC less than more \"typical\" shifter builds.\u00a0 With full Tumble, a +5 deflection AC merge and Barkskin pre-buff, a hasted RL would approach the more typical 55+ AC range.\u00a0 In this build, without any further enhancements, like reaching the DEX cap (+6 AC), the build will fall in the 51+ AC range.<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Mostly they're either casters (which I would still have to watch out for) or self-buffers (maybe less so?), which I tend to regard as the slightly scarier variant. Pallys would also still be an issue. Still a glimmer of hope at least. That said, because I've not played online at all, I could be completely misrepresenting the danger they pose, which is considerable even without the turning. I haven't played far enough into Aielund to see any clerics, but it should prove interesting if I do encounter any.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I am assuming that it isn't a low-magic environment.\u00a0 If it is, the lofty AC won't be necessary because the enemies generally won't have an AB worthy enough to hit any AC over 35-ish and Undead Shape banned.\u00a0 Chances are, during your travels, you will encounter some gear item that has a +5 bonus.\u00a0 It could be the armor (or robe), a shield (matters not what size), a cloak, a pair of dodge boots (no UMD or monk in this build, though), perhaps one of those +5 natural ammies or some ring of protection (again, deflection). Any of those will provide that expected +5 deflection for the total merge.\u00a0 Just beware that the AC bonus types never stack and it should be easy to glean +5 from common items.<br/>\n<br/>\n The additional AC enhancements I was referring to are mainly items to raise DEX to the cap (+12, i.e. +6 modifier) and permahaste.\u00a0 I like to use some weapon of speed, if one exists, rather than clogging the boot slot with permahaste since there are usually many unusual enhancments on boots. The build covers just about every class weapon imaginable so the choice is wide.\u00a0 Make sure to use a one-hand weapon, though.\u00a0 Any range weapons like darts will not merge.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, potentially you could add another +10 to the level I described for any of the armed forms and that means breaching the 60 AC barrier.\u00a0 It's actually quite overpowering in all but the highest magic environments.<br/>\n<br/>\n If, for example, there is any item that bestows immunity to evocation school (but not on a belt), then this RL would be near invincible.\u00a0 But immunities are rare in mid-magic content for good reason.\u00a0 Too hard to balance challenge.\n<blockquote><div>You know, off the top of my head, I can't think of many cleric builds that choose to focus on pumping CHA, so the max HD of the turn would be slightly lower. Mostly they're either casters (which I would still have to watch out for) or self-buffers (maybe less so?), which I tend to regard as the slightly scarier variant. Pallys would also still be an issue. Still a glimmer of hope at least. That said, because I've not played online at all, I could be completely misrepresenting the danger they pose, which is considerable even without the turning. I haven't played far enough into Aielund to see any clerics, but it should prove interesting if I do encounter any.</div></blockquote>\n CHA is used mainly to slightly increase the number of creatures turned by adding all their class HD.\u00a0 It is also used to modify the turn check, but that is just a d20 roll so that means you might escape a few attempts but when facing a mob of clerics, the odds are in their favor.\u00a0 Keep in mind that the RL's HD for that calculation is the shifter level, not the toon level.\u00a0 That would be the grand total of 11 (or 12 near the end of the build). It works the same way for the opposed cleric.\u00a0 It's the class level that is used to determine HD for the turning calculation, not the character level.\u00a0 And no help from turn resistance to boot.\u00a0 That's 50-50 chance to increase the 2d6 up to +4.\u00a0 Add the cleric's class level onto that and it gets pretty ugly. Who knows if the designer assigned sun domain to them as well?\u00a0 Whether they have high CHA or not has little effect on the outcome in the case of a low-level shifter (meaning Shf 30 would be the highest class HD possible).<br/>\n<br/>\n Short story (sorta)...<br/>\n<br/>\n The first attempt I made testing a working RL was with the SoU-HotU expansions because I knew that plan could be accomplished within 28 levels easily.\u00a0 I arranged a fast RL (Level 21) and was cruising through HotU so easily as an RL I thought I had corrupted the toon with some sort of godly skin somehow. It was so easy! (And I always play on \"Very Difficult\" setting to better reflect server play.)\u00a0 Well, yes, easy... until that final battle of Chapter 2 where around 20 duergar clerics stood poised outside the gate, up to that point just healing their wounded comrades and ignoring my toon's presence.\u00a0\u00a0 The RL killing machine rushed out to bless them in that special way it had become accustomed to up to that point (sharp blade at the end of pole seeking heads... hehehe) and... WHAAA? It was turned before it got more than 2 steps through the gate and roamed like a lost puppy getting pummeled to death with fire attacks without recourse.\u00a0 All I could see was all the lost XP I had been anticipating for those juicy duergar kills.\u00a0 Lesson learned and noted.\u00a0 \"RL shall henceforward avoid clerics like the plague.\"\u00a0 Since then, my RLs have never been turned and the minotaur has been christening its greataxe with fresh blood.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

And the druid buffs are really only frosting on the cake, if you follow my drift.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
