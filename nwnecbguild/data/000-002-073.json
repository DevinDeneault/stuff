      "content": "<div>One of the problems with going for both kobold and Risen Lord shapes is which stats get overwritten. With kobold it's DEX, so you can pile your stat bumps into STR, whereas with Risen Lord it's STR, so you'd want to boost DEX. With both, you either find yourself not excelling in either shape or you excel in one at the expense of the other.
