I'm very new in character building and this guild is best place to find advices in this question. I want to make assassin with my lovest weapon scythe so it should be STR-based build. Also, he gonna HiPS every fight exclude true seers, I know the biggest weak this type of builds (AC of course). <br/>\nOther options:<br/>\n1) PvM 1-40. <br/>\n2) Reach the HiPS as early as possible.<br/>\n3) Human or Elf (maybe halfelf). <br/>\n4) Mid-High magic environments. <br/>\n5) High death attack DC. <br/>\n6) No need spells, I can use scrolls and wands. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I'm opened for every ideas...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

He just a shadow assassin with the magic dire scythe, I'm not sure how to realize that in nwn.

What you gain is a reduction in armor check penalty from -8 with full plate to -2 with chain shirt or scale mail, equal to a +6 to stealth skills. You also get a bonus to stealth from the extra dex you have added.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you only change the \"robe\" of your armor, you don't need any crafting skills at all, and it's free.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I found out another sad thing, assassin king have not any pre-epic stealth (penalties from plate) except invis and darkness which mean toe to toe playstyle \u00a0until lvl 22. It's not crucial but sneaking is more enjoyable. I think about ranger instead of fighter but there is less amount of feats i don't know. If you tell me to keep standing this fighter way i will do<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
