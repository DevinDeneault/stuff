She will also have 50% concealment, minimum +1 AC/AB from the Dex spell (but will most always be +2 since minimum is +3 Dex), and a maximum +3 AC/AB with immunity to mind spells, immunity to level 1 spells, and the ability to see any foe coming her way. These spells will all last a minimum of 11 turns (some of them can be extended to 22 turns), and some can even last up to 11 - 22 hours. Plenty long enough for most situations, and even if they wear off she is still formidable.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor utility in a party, she should re-organize her spell book accordingly to focus on supplemental abilities. Choice spells may include Flame Weapon, Keen Edge, etc. She can also summon forth \"Wonder Girl\", her faithful pixie, for trap-filled and lock-filled dungeons.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer strengths are versatility and ability to choose her location. She has a strong defense with spells such as Haste, Improved Invisibility, and True Seeing (to see any oncoming enemies from shadows). She is also very effective at hiding in shadows. In addition, she has an AC of 28 with none of her defenses up and wearing nothing but a mundane robe. By being mobile as if she had the feat \"Spring Attack\" with her tumble ranks, and with her ability to use the above mentioned spells, she can easily escape any situation to reach a favorable spot. In addition, her AB is extremely good due to her high Dex, which gives her +52/+47/+42/+37/+52 (rapid shot) with nothing but a normal longbow! That's with no buffs at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is her favorable spot you may ask? Why, high ground, of course!<br/>\nWhen Facing A Multitude Of Foes...<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce in a favorable spot, she should call upon illusions to summon forth a Greater Conjuration and the Web spell to slow her enemies to a halt. She should then Hasten herself to release a Cloudkill, a Stinking Cloud, and another Web. This will not only slow them to a halt, but potentially deal great damage with the spells alone. Once they are webbed, she should invoke her Imbue Arrow to devastate them with flames. If there is an enemy archer, she should release an Interposing Hand to cut the accuracy of her foe. If there are multiple archers, she should invoke the power of her Hail of Arrows. Immediately after the Hail, she should invoke her rapid shot and then quickly cast Haste if her original one wore off for the additional attack - enabling her to wipe out the archers quickly before her snares on the ground troops wear off. Then she can re-focus her attention on the ground troops, even relocating herself once again if the troops are closing on her.<br/>\nWhen Facing A Single, Hard To Hit Powerful Foe...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf facing a foe that is too powerful and has a rough hide, she should quickly establish a favorable spot using her spells and stealth techniques. She should then make herself strike true - utilizing the power of the True Strike that she can utilize 4 times/day. With this power guiding her arrows, she will surely strike the foe several times, and with her high damage (1-8 +18 without mighty, x3 crits) the foe cannot last long. She can also use Imbue Arrow on monsters who are flammable, for that cannot be dodged easily at all!<br/>\n<br/>\nFor all other situations, she should improvise and consider using a combination of techniques.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttacking...<br/>\nBAB: 27<br/>\nAB: Base = 27; Focuses: +2; Prowess: +1; Dexterity: +12; Enchanted Arrows: +12; 54/49/44/39 (usually greater due to empowered Cat's Grace)  <br/>\n<br/>\nNote: add +1 AB for Point Blank Shot within 15 feet (i.e. max AB +55) per Hip 110911<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bewildering Archer's Spell Book<br/>\nLevel 1:\tTrue Strike x4, Shield x1, Mage Armor x1<br/>\nLevel 2:\tUltravision x1, Web x2, Fox's Cunning x1, Bull's Strength x1,<br/>\nGhostly Visage x1<br/>\nLevel 3:\tExtended Endurance x1, Protection from Elements x1, Stinking Cloud x1, Haste x3<br/>\nLevel 4:\tImproved Invisibility x1, Empowered Cat's Grace x1, Fear x1,<br/>\nExtended Haste x1<br/>\nLevel 5:\tCloudkill x1, Greater Shadow Conjuration x1, Bigby's Interposing Hand x1<br/>\nLevel 6:\tExtended Lesser Mind Blank x1, True Seeing x1<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
