Couldn't play on Higher Grounds because i'm still waiting to get my own key (should be soon).<br/>\n<br/>\nAny other worlds people like to play on?<br/>\n<br/>\nCan someone tell me the difference between World of Greyhawk and Heart of Winter? I know one is allot more pvp orientated but i am also curious on size, pve content and other differences.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

This PW subforum is the perfect place to list this information.  Few of us who don't play a custom server have the time to acquaint ourselves with specialized rules but still would like to contribute something useful to a custom build request if the info is at our fingertips (page load on the forumer is extremely fast!).   The back 'n forth banter (via posting or PM) to gradually reveal the details is counter-productive, unnecessarily tedious and slow, IMHO.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Quite a number of people playing, down to exping and questing with RP close to none existing :P One issue i have tho, there is some wicked crafting system that requires you to build a crafter build or use aid of other player who build one them self. Most high level players characters will have their weapons enhanced to +20... Which means you will stay greatly behind with your randomly dropped +6 weapons... That being said, can't fault the place for anything else.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

They call it unlimited level mainly because you progress lvl 40 and keep going. New player created areas are added (the latest area is designed for toons level 1500 and above). To reach a level that high from what I can tell it would take about 1000 X level to reach the next level. To go from level 50 to level 51 would take about 51,000 exp, so level 100 to 101 would be 101,000 exp. The baddies are tough but the exp is great, party safe for spells, etc. Website =\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://aventia3.freeforums.net/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://aventia3.freeforums.net/</a>, worth a look as it never gets to be the same server running a new toon.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
