Really hard to fine tune this the way it sits. \u00a0Make sure to list any ability adjustments for the subrace as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n What domains did you select?<br/>\n<br/>\n Your skill set seems really conflicting to me but won't make any suggestions without seeing some sort of organized level-by-level list posted. \u00a0That's just me. \u00a0Perhaps other members may like to take some shots in the dark. \u00a0You need not furnish the enhancements that items provide except the general magic level cap for armor &amp; weapons (like +5, or whatever). \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Make sure to provide both beginning and ending ability spreads so we can identify the state of the toon at creation.<br/>\n<br/>\n Help us help you.

ALWAYS. \u00a0Trying to stay hasted during prolonged PvP sessions relying solely on potion buffs can be a real bite. \u00a0Lots of lost rounds and AoOs.<br/>\n<br/>\n The best fit would have been (in retrospect, of course), to focus more on DEX since your melee attack will be ancillary anyway. \u00a0KD/IKD is fine, but with a high-level acid sheath you could end up pounding yourself to death with a weapon anyway, especially if they polymorph into a balor or other uber HP form and send the mummy lord or dracolich to defend them (assuming they took those epic spells) while they wait for one of their Bigby's to stick.. \u00a0There's nothing stopping them from using extended greater sanctuary and casting a BBoD either. \u00a0And they all keep True Seeing intact so stealth (and invisibility for that matter) is worthless.<br/>\n<br/>\n Caster-focused attack schemes should really concentrate on building as many caster levels as possible, hoping that their spells can pass SR checks regularly and just use their divine powers alone to dominate melee situations (divine damage is usually impossible to resist or reduce, hence the effectiveness of Divine Might if you have it).<br/>\n<br/>\n I'll await feedback before I comment further, Hafen.<br/>\n<br/>\n @Valerfor: Thanks for the clarification. \u00a0Actually, I figured it was a typo but now that you've made the error more visible, EVERY viewer/contributor will understand.\u00a0<img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

With the Cl 12/ F 5/ Ro 3 split at level 20 you get BAB 16 and get the cleric spellpower late. Take cl 20 pre epic, then 4 Fighter levels and grab EWF and a general feat (eg G. str/G. wis)at level 21, AS at level 22, then WS and EWS at level 24. Then take 3 levels of Rogue and max tumble at level 27. Top it off with two Fighter levels, max discipline and take EP as bonus Fighter feat. The last level is Cleric and let you max spellcraft. Final spreadL Cl 21/ F6/ Ro3. That way you only spend one general epic feat on combat feats and the xp penalties will also come later.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Feats: power attack (!!!!) weapon focus improved KD blind fight extended spell<br/>\n 2 = no. My goal is battle cleric who uses his magic in offense in form of no-save spells: harm, word of faith, silence (when usec on myself no save is done, and all who enter area of effect is  with no save).<br/>\n 3= i would rather call it strategy cause it is overall idea. <br/>\n Most common foes are in ud wizzards and sorceress (their ego leads them against priestesshood). My strategy is delaying and surviving long enough to kill them. Into combat going warded which means dispelling takes their offensive action just to figure out i am having saves high enough to resist holding, disabling and death spells along eith higher ammount of hps preventing cheesy combos ruin and hellball to kill me in one turn.<br/>\n On the other hand, wof and harm would give me tools how to deal with them. Using scroll of disjunction or breach is counted.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n I wont have enough spells to allow myself luxury of divine power as main spells. But what i will use to the fully is divine favor +5 ab and divine dmg.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also every wiz or sorc will always dispell cleric if has lvls more 25+. ,Contrary disjunction scroll has caster lvl 17 not enough to dry dispell me, (17+d20 versus 32) so meleers relying on them wont manage to dispell all combat buffs and spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n This is how i think. Also for my use 9 th circle offers little same as eight but silent spell can move somr good spells there and free the pressed up circles (harm heal word of faith greater restoration).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It is gimped right off the bat. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n If you planned your slot allotment this poorly perhaps you should have made the Strength domain a priority from jump street. \u00a0But since you didn't, are you telling us you don't have room to slot a single extended DP at level 5? \u00a0Or a few at Level 4? \u00a0That's really all it takes. \u00a0Strength domain would have allowed Levels 3 and 4 to manage them as well. \u00a0This is a common domain choice for battle clerics for exactly the reasons described. \u00a0I'm having trouble imagining what \"main spells\" are being used at Level 4 and 5 for a build that is claiming not to be focusing on offensive spellcasting. \u00a0It's possible if there are limitations for domain choices for drow that it may not be the best choice, if that is a customization granted on the server.<br/>\n<br/>\n You would have been better assigning all but STR 13 to WIS if you were anticipating some difficulty managing slots. \u00a0I love PA/IPA for a battle cleric with almost infinite AB buffing capacity but STR focus (anything over the prereq is \"focus\") is counter-productive to say the least.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'll see what I can piece together for a drow priestess from\u00a0clvl 13 to 30 but it won't be pretty. This is not going to rounding off, though. \u00a0More like trying to get a car wreck back on the road again long enough to make it to a service station.\u00a0 I'll probably be ticketed for working on it in a No Parking zone.\u00a0</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I had lots of extended DP but when it was out, the combat prowess went rapidly down. But you are right that 16 str and 18str is no big difference right now (only +1ab/damage) i could perhaps move it to con (or else?). I am going to use it in combat, however i do not wish to rely on it fully.<br/>\n<br/>\n For the dispell concern: spellcaster level 20 means i am hard to dispell by common dispell spells, unless epic abjurer (adds +6). Spellcaster with mordekanys will always dry dispell me - it counts his caster level (arcane casters go mostly 25+ caster levels) plus d20 against mine +12. So difference between 23 and 20 is just roll of 7 or 9 to dispell a magic effect on me. However number of classes for split is still opened.<br/>\n<br/>\n Why i originaly decided to go rogue pre epic was to get additional +3 reflex save and early use of spell mantle scrolls+disjunction scrolls.<br/>\n<br/>\n The most common spellcaster tactics used to kill clerics around (many of them are simple clerics with around 200-300 hps) is either maximalised IGMS, great ruin+hellball, dispell + death spell, or bigies holding versions.<br/>\n<br/>\n I have to take it all into account, to prevent them from being easy target (most people avoid fighting those hard to kill).<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh and also, it seems that going bard instead rogue be better: rogue gives +2ref +1ref(1st and 3rd lvl) while bard offers +2 ref +2will (1st) and +1+1 (at 3rd).<br/>\n<br/>\n Edit: right now was applied change when caster lvl cap was removed from greater dispel<img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
