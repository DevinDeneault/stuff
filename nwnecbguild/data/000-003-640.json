Given that part 4 is already out, we're looking at maybe another 3-4 years before the whole beastie is complete, which admittedly would be a long wait to finalize your build. No problem at all with flexibility, except that building to level x might sometimes gimp its future development.

The extra AC from the large shield HP and fort save will help immensely if you plan to melee at level 2, and you will not have great AB for dual wielding anyway (not yet at least).<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, I have not yet played Swordflight which has a reputation of being difficult.\u00a0<br/>\nIf you do not think you will be able to melee at level 2, then you could go Rogue 2-3 at levels 2-3 instead before taking Fighter 1-2.\u00a0<br/>\nTrouble is, sometimes the module will not let you have a choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nStag (the boss here) has promised to have a look and I am interested in what his thoughts would be (I am learning too!) so I am going to refrain from commenting further :)<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

As I'm sure you appreciate, everything comes at a price, and here the cost is not taking SD until epic levels, a loss of skill points, and a diminution of sneak attack potency. What you get, however, is your full wish-list of feats, a marginally higher AB, and Epic Dodge. I restricted myself to your original stat distribution and the three classes you chose. I've tried to max its potency to level 27 while hopefully making it playable at all levels.

I find gas traps of little use personally, and prefer the others (Fire/Electrical/Tangle/Holy/Sonic/Frost/Negative). I generally only set traps outside of combat. It makes sense to take Skill Mastery if you want to set them during combat, it will also help with opening locks and retrieving/disabling traps too.<br/>\n<br/>\nEither way you get a pile of skill points if you do that for a dex build, you might only need 5-8 ranks in set trap to get to modified set trap 15.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to set Epic Traps, you will require Set Trap 45 modified which seems hard to obtain in a level 27-28 build.\u00a0<br/>\nI do not know the environment well enough if that is worth the investment but it seems unlikely to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nLikewise Open Lock can potentially be reduced to if the Knock spell is easily obtainable and many locks can be opened with this spell with Take 20 you add +20 to your open lock score to unlock things, so Open Lock 20 modified = can open DC 40 locks etc etc. Need to know the environment if this is a potential option.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway these suggestions *might* could give you the desired skill points for Listen or Spot without compromising on persuade. I think at least one detection skill is worthwhile for a sneaker, if you can detect them before they detect you it allows you to plan your next move proactively, rather than reacting to the enemy's attacks.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You need the stealth skills. Tumble's AC bonus speaks for itself. Fairly crappy saves mean Spellcraft is essential to protect you as far as possible from casters. And UMD gives you access to scrolls, wands, and gear you wouldn't otherwise be able to use. If you don't know where your enemy is, then you're screwed, so you need at least one detection skill. That leaves points to distribute between \"nice\" things. You want to discover and disable traps (recovering them if possible), so you don't get bits of you blown off. Good. So that's some Search and Disable Traps. You haven't the strength to bash locks, but you probably want to get inside chests, so Open Locks also gets a tick (and don't forget about using Lock Picks to help you). So at the bottom of this pile are Set Trap (unless you want a very different type of build) and Persuade - regardless of what Rogueknight (the author) says. Apart from anything else, he's not going to invest all his time and effort into a set of modules that rely on a winning smile.<br/>\n<br/>\nThink about your priorities. What my draft tries to do is cover your arse for the first 2 levels - that's all defence. Then it's getting the basics of combat abilities up to speed. Then you blossom into dual-wielding - when you're capable of landing regular hits, not just attempts. The rest is pretty colours, except for ED, which is a Dexer's nirvana.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, go and have a mull.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Ninja'd by Orion (for which my thanks), but I'll let it stand.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
