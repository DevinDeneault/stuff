And he should drop the two-bladed sword and use a 1-handed weapon or else with a 39 AB will hit only the air.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">It depends. The situation calls for a ITWF DD that Dual-Wields Kukris   <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, it's a trap probably. Stay with a Dwarven Waraxe and a Tower Shield, your job isn't hacking left &amp; right with Kukris but to be a defender. Some of the bonuses will stack nicely with your class feautures, ignore those that will not. Dirty fighting is about the most useless feat there is, do nothing about it and don't use it, while the Barbarian damage mitigation will come in handy as well the taunt/ intimidate skill bonus, provided your DD has the intelligence to take those skills. For this reason i suggest you change the initial attributes of the build to STR 16  DEX 13  CON 18  INT 13  WIS 08  CHA 06. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow there is a thing you didn't tell me, are those bonuses coming from a sub-race or an item?<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause if they come from a sub-race, minuses to INT for example can be devastating to a build - i am answering here also to your other thread, where you ask a similar thing. Because if those penalties come from items then the integrity of the builds won't change much and in most cases, i remember an item from HoTU for example (The cloak of Kings) that gave you many bonuses but had a -4 penalty to CHA. If you were try to wear this cloak while you had an amulet of health for example then you would get all the bonuses and take none of the minuses as the amuler prevented the loss of attributes. But if those thing come from a sub-race then you can do little about it. In any case the feats you take whie leveling up, lets say you have initialy an INT of &gt;13 and take the Expertise feat, won't be lost if you have an item that decreases your INT after that, but an initial modification to your INT score will make you unable to take the feat at all unless you start with a much higher INT than that in order to counter-blalance the loss. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hope i made myself clear, have fun<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The minuses aren't so bad, you will just start with a DEX of 15 to get to 13. Wisdom is less important and CHA let it sink to the bottom of the sea, you will get +50 to these checks anyway. Only balance your DEX to be after the modofications of the sub-race to 13 and you are done.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
