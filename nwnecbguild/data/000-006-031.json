      "content": "<div>This is a Druid-Knight i made that compines spell-power with solid melee presence at the battlefield. He can make all sort of combo's such as lay down a stonehold field and then destroy everything with his blade, Harm/ Heal or do anything really. He is undispellable with solid spell penetration check that beats SR 32 every single time and between his stoneskin/ premonition/ death ward and other buffs he can do he was never in real danger when i played him up to 37th lvl at least. Keep an elemental swarm with him, just to be on the safe side, that along with your buffed animal companion and your full plate should be more than enough to keep you unharmed. There are some changes you can do as well since we are not feat-starved here, like replace IKD with Expertise even for more tanking potencial and you can freely distribute your more than enough skill points to things like Search and the like if you want to. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway i will let the build speak for itself, have a nice playthrough with him if you select him.

He is a fairly solid spellsword that has the AB and damage to stand up to a real fighter while having all of the Druids perks. While he is not wisdom-based he manages to get ESF in Conjuration school and thus his most potent spells will have a relative good DC. CoT gives him a good boost in his saves while offers him the valuable spot skill. The order of levels are such as to maximize efficiency and keep him at maximum discipline ranks. Lastly he has a solid D20 +32 penentration against spell soakers.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Of course,<br/>\n<br/>\nAt low levels you play him exactly as you would play a fighter with a sword &amp; shield, using your spells to buff mainly and your animal companion to distract/ finish off your foes. Later and still at pre-epic levels you have the option to use your evocation AoE spells to soften up your enemies before you engage them in melee combat, spells like \"call lightning\", \"flamestrike\", \"ice storm\",  \"entangle\" and \"vine mine\", are all useful for that. But the real deal comes once you have your sixth and above level of your spells, What it cannot be \"Harmed\" or \"Healed\" to the death, it will succumb to the powerful \"Stonehold\" &amp; \"Storm of Vengeance\". Often i found myself attacking paralyzed/ stunned foes that offered no resistance at all, what was immune to these it could most likely dealt with Harm/ Heal and your blade. And by then your animal companion (i suggest a black panther) buffed with flameberry (flame weapon for animal companions), empowered awaken, greater magic fang, stoneskin, empowered bull's strength, protection from elements, barkskin  and extended aura of vitality would carve them into tiny little pieces. I always kept an elemental swarm as well for absorbing the Mord's from enemy meges and provide additional protection. If i was low on hp's, i could still outlast my enemies between the several layers of protection that i had, my summons &amp; animal companion and simply Heal myself. True seeing and ultravision at lower levels helped immensely as well to detect any hidden foes that could otherwise be the doom of me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpells used for buffing (In order of levels): Resistance, Endure elements, ultravision, barkskin, resist elements, bull's strength/ empowered bull's strength, protection from elements, freedom of movement, stoneskin, death ward, spell resistance, extended monstrous regeneration, energy buffer, greater stoneskin, extended regenerate, extended aura of vitality, true seeing, premonition.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpells used for battlefield control: Entangle, grease, spike growth, vine mine, stonehold/ empowered stonehold, creeping doom, sunburst/ sunbeam, storm of vengeance.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpells used for offense: Call lightning/ empowered call lightning, flame strike/ empowered flame strike, empowered ice storm, empowered crumble, drown, sunburst/ sunbeam, empowered firestorm.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpells used for generic support: Elemental swarm, summon creature VIII (that is an elder elemental due to Druid advanced summons).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's it, some of the spells might be better or worst, depending on each individual PW but generally Druids are rarely nerfed in their spells and mostly if that happens it will occur in their Dragon-shape abilities. Frankly the best part is that all these spells and abilities felt it was more of an \"Extra\" and not something you had to do to survive. Even without any of these spells this melee Druid was capable of holding his own in fights and was never weak.</div>"

I can only find one build with Druid/ Bard/ AA, and that build only has 1-one level of Druid in it. There are a few Druid/ Wizard/ AA Zen-builds though with Druid between 13 and 28 levels. So perhaps this is something to look into.</div>",

It makes sense to me for a druid to be a tank while animal companions attack sneakily from the side because druids have good defence buffs so they can stand their ground. Going Zen patch is useless because you will never be as good as a DEX archer for ranged attacks, so it's better to focus on melee + some nice spells without armour failure. Love it!</div>"

So in my opinion, it is better to stick with melee as a Druid. If you want to be ranged, either go for a DEX build or use a Cleric instead of a Druid for ranged.</div>"
