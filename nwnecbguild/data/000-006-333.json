However, as it's only good for spells to Level 4 with low caster levels (with some significant exceptions), most buff wands are low-duration low-DC and unless the server is easy to accrue XP, can make leveling much slower (meaning I wouldn't start crafting wands until I reached the level cap i.e craft a wand, kill a pile of monsters, rinse &amp; repeat).  Add to those issues that the charge count is a random dice roll, I seldom take that feat unless the PC is a very high level one (in this context, over 30) to get max charges to make it economically-feasible.  Wizards are feat-glutted so have them to spare on convenience feats but not so much with sorcs, bards or divine spellcasters. And bards can't craft War Cry wands which I would seriously love to see. So...<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes WoG modify this feat at all?  This is interesting to me and I apologize for pseudo-hijacking this topic.</div>"

Seriously...</div></blockquote>You don't get +1 AB from Divine Might, you get +1 divine damage; +1 AB from EP will let you hit more often and that effectively more than make up for the lost +1 divine damage, not to say it's \"active\" even when divine might is not or has run out of uses. AS is +2 natural AC always present vs +1 dodge AC (lost when flatfooted) present only with DS active. Since your saves are already good and your AB is low and that extra AC never hurts especially to compensate for a lowish AB (you'll take more time to kill enemies so you need to reduce how often you get hit). You would lose one lvl 2 and one lvl 6 bonus spells.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>Craft wand is a good option, but... I'll be true, I never use it playin' NwN...</div></blockquote>If gold and XPs are not hard to come by and even more if a magic electrifier is available Craft wand means the capacity to have a big reservoire of uninterruptable and fast firing healing, summons, backup buffs (couple lvl 1 summons with some buffs and you'll drain enemy spellcasters of their dispels), extra buffs for shortlived stuff, get out of dodge spells (invisibility, improved invis, even haste and expeditious retreat), attack and debilitating spells and extra spells given your restricted known spells as a bard (learn them on a lvl so that you can craft them into a wand then change them on the next lvl for your stable choice). It's a real big bonus. And for mages and clerics it's even better.</div>"

I invite you to go and examine lvl 1-4 spell lists. If you stop to think about those spells you'll see the big potential many of them have, no matter the lowish caster lvl (btw, I invite everyone to download TK's improvement on craft magic feats from the vault... gotta post a link somewhere). Disposable summons to distract/lure enemies, set off traps, drain spells from spellchuckers; healing; direct attack spells like HotG, ILMS just to mention two of the best but also Combust, MM, Melf's Acid Arrow; backup buffs, cause Murphy''s law is a reality and Murphy was actually an optimist; Invisibility/Improved invisibility, many a character's life savers; stoneskin; etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding charges, it depends from a module switch. In some places you automatically get the full 50 charges (I think that's actually the default behavior) in other you get the random ones, which are still a good investment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, one thing to consider is that spells cast from wands are not interruptable, do not provoke an AoO (which makes them great for healing among the rest) and fire off faster than ordinary, non hasted spells and anyhow faster than scrolls or potions. The speed of casting invis from wand vs getting it from a potion has often saved my characters' life.<br/>\n<br/>\nWoG simply has TK's improvements implemented, but I'd get the feat nonetheless even without them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is true that the environment has to make it feasible, so gold and XPs must not be a pit ato get.</div>"

I need to study the list in more depth.  Some that seemed benign could be used to better advantage than I had assumed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do use the Summon Creature ones exactly as you described but the ones that interests me most are the healing ones.  And I did know about the HotG oddity with the out-of-whack casting level (meaning it doesn't seem to follow the same algorithm as most crafted wands), very nice for mad clerics. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo the heal wands work like turbocharged heal kits then?  Hmmm... I would have thought they triggered AoOs like potions.  More notes to jot down.  Keep 'em coming, Kail. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot having played many different servers I assumed that the recharger gizmos were mostly used on high-magic worlds, at least I've never seen any outside of the OCs.  That would indeed make the XP investment much more economic.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy all means, hunt down TK's system.  Sounds interesting. Is it okay to use in vanilla or must the CEP be installed?</div>"
