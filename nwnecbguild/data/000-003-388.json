      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hi there.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, thanks for all the work you do here. You really inspire a lot of player and help them to survive even in the direst nwn servers!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was looking for a nice lolth priest build. <br/>\n<br/>\nLooking around this forum I found some idea that could be nice, for instance the Sehanine's Finest build (Cleric 15/Bard 2/Arcane Archer 23) seems to suits well with an elf (drow) character. But I'm not sure if it fit the idea of a drow priest keeping aways while shooting... maybe, maybe.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther nice build (IMHO) is the Last Rites (Cleric(16), Assassin(22), Shadowdancer(2)), but assassination seems to male-drow work business, and the build is created for a human character (for me, the best race, but role playing is roleplaying).<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's why I'd like to ask you about a cleric drow build able to survive the underdark, from level 1 to 40 (the server is Ethernan, extremely hard enviroment specially for evil people like drows, duergars and minos). My previous experience teachs me that a very well desing character is needed to avoid constant death.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe race information is, of course:<br/>\n<br/>\nAbility adjustments: +2 Dex, +2 Int, +2 Cha, -2 Con<br/>\nDarkvision: Drow can see in the dark.<br/>\nSleeplessness: Immune to spells and effects of the sleep subtype.<br/>\nHardiness vs. enchantments: +2 racial bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting spells.<br/>\nIron will: +2 racial bonus on will saving throws.<br/>\nSkill affinity (listen): +2 racial bonus to listen checks.<br/>\nSkill affinity (search): +2 racial bonus to search checks.<br/>\nSkill affinity (spot): +2 racial bonus to spot checks.<br/>\nKeen senses: Drow make active search checks automatically and with no movement penalties.<br/>\nSpell resistance: Innate spell resistance of 11 plus 1 per level.<br/>\nLight blindness: Abrupt exposure to light blinds a drow for 1 round. In addition, drow suffer a -1 circumstance penalty to attack rolls, saves and checks while operating in bright light.<br/>\nSpell ability - darkness: Can cast darkness once per day at third level.<br/>\nSpell ability - faerie fire: Can cast faerie fire once per day at third level.<br/>\nElven: Drow are considered elven for the purpose of spells. <br/>\nPredilect class: wizard for male, priest for female.<br/>\nShort sword proficiency<br/>\nLight crossbow proficiency<br/>\nLevel adjustment +2<br/>\n<br/>\nBest regards!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hey, man!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the author of Sehanine's Finest, I have to say that the build itself is more of an archer than a proper priest. It doesn't cast much, uses DEX  instead of WIS as the sniping stat and has 23 AA levels. Yes, AB and Damage should be very high with Imbue Arrows + Divine Favor, but it's just not that much of a priestess.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have two builds that can fulfill the role of a full-power priestess with really good sniping prowess:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/speedy-sniper-cleric-26-monk-3-wizard-11-t2335699.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Speedy Sniper</a><br/>\n<br/>\nor <br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/demolition-man-cleric-38-monk-1-rogue-1-t515420.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Demolition Man</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe first is a sniper that utilizes the synergy of Zen Archer and Cleric casting stat being Wisdom to be a very good caster while remaining a competent sniper. It's built to make use of Expeditious Retreat stacking with Monk Speed removing the speed cap. You can truly run like crazy for a few seconds after you get Monk 3 and 1st level Wizard spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second one is a powerhouse Zen Archer / Caster with 38 Cleric levels and 38 final unbuffed Wisdom. The first version is more of a sniper, and further down the topic you will find a more caster-oriented version of the build. You can actually do anything inbetween those two to make it suit your environment, in other words, tweak to taste.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks for your help, man!<br/>\n<br/>\nAt first I skipped this two builds because of the monk levels. You know, lolth (primary goodness of the drow elves) is chaotic evil, so a lawful priestess seems... weird. But these builds are very tough, that is what I need to avoid death, so maybe I could reach a compromise between both ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese clerics are known for their use of the whip, but not necessary in battlefield. As they have focus with small swords and light crossbow, I guess I could choose the latest as ranged weapon, but taking rapid reload... so in the end a longbow would be better (1-8 damage instead 1-6) with the same cost (rapid reload or focus: longbow). Light crossbows are more drow-like weapons... roleplaying sucks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019m unsure about the plant domain. As I know, the more useful skills that are domain chosen are improved invisibility (treachery, that is lolth primary domain, so ok) and stone skin (power and magic). Power comes with divine might (not sure of it usefulness, never use it before) and magic with ice storm (not save allowed, if I remember well). Another domain comes to my head, animal, that creates better companions and leaves all level 9 slots for implosions (and there are A HUGE AMOUNT of animals in the Ethernan server, not so dangerous, but many). You said you choose plant for the bar skin spell (natural armor) but I'm not sure, there are plenty of items with natural armor bonuses...<br/>\n<br/>\nBetween speedy and demolition, I'm more interested in the demolition, as it seems to me that implosions are more drow-like that running around while shooting (for a lolth priest). It\u2019s just a personal choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoing a small adjustment on the demolition layout: <br/>\n<br/>\nCleric(38), Monk(1), Rogue(1), Drow Elf<br/>\n<br/>\nAlignment: Lawful (?)

If not... well, have I said that I prefer humankind?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think about this build?<br/>\n<br/>\nPD: BAD NEWS! Server rules forbid multiclass between cleric and monk! Other rules that I did not know are:<br/>\n- characters shoud have 0 or at least 10 shadow dancer level, to take one after the other and before level 25.<br/>\n- if 2 common classes are chosen, they need to have no more that 3 level of difference between then.<br/>\n- some combos are forbidden: Monk-Druid and Monk-Cleric (ouch!)<br/>\n- dragon disciple class is forbidden with special exceptions<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I was thinking more of a Cleric 38 Monk 1 Assassin 1 for RP. You could even sacrifice one Great Wisdom feat for Cleric 35 Monk 3 Assassin 2 to have Uncanny Dodge and keep your DEX bonuses to AC That would cost you one AB but would also open a feat for you to take Extend Spell. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou should avoid close combat with Called Shot, True Seeing and a summoned creature to tank for you. However, sometimes it's unavoidable. In that case you're better served with a GMW'd Darkfired Kama with 7 attacks per round. The problem is that the natural armor items are all amulets, which is also the slot you use to equip periapts of Wisdom. If your server has other Wisdom-enhancing items that occupy other slots, then that is droppable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would personally forget about Animal domain. I'd choose between Travel (if there is no perma-haste), Trickery (for Improved Invisibility, which gives you concealment against archers), Strength (for 2 levels of Divine Power and Stoneskin) or War (for Cat's Grace to increase your AC when you take the first Monk level and Aura of Vitality, to increase DEX and CON by 4 each for your toughest battles). I advise you against going pure Cleric, You can go Cleric 38 / Monk 1 / Assassin 1 or Cleric 35 / Monk 3 / Assassin 2 to be more Drow-RP friendly. Lawful Evil could mean you're loyal to Llolth, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: just read your new findings. That sucks, huh? OK, Sehanine's Finest is the way to go then. Good news is that it's pretty competent in melee too.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Divine Power will raise your STR to 18 if it's any lower, but on the other hand you may need to wear a full plate with a pure cleric, as you have no other means of having a competitive AC. You can go for 12 CON, DEX and 14 STR to be able to bear more weight and wear a Full Platemail armor. Or you can get 16 DEX and 8 STR (DP will raise it to 18 anyway) and go for a Chain Shirt armor. I didn't have time to look at the feats, but combat casting is VERY BAD. Just take Extend Spell instead. You'll need some copies of Divine Power, and that will allow you to cast it in 2 spell levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Divine Power will raise your STR to 18 if it's any lower, but on the other hand you may need to wear a full plate with a pure cleric, as you have no other means of having a competitive AC. You can go for 12 CON, 10 DEX and 14 STR to be able to bear more weight and wear a Full Platemail armor. Or you can get 16 DEX and 8 STR (DP will raise it to 18 anyway) and go for a Chain Shirt armor. I didn't have time to look at the feats, but off the top of my head, combat casting is VERY BAD. Just take Extend Spell instead. You'll need some copies of Divine Power and Divine Favor to last you through the day, and that will allow you to cast them in 2 spell levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I suppose I could improve a little bit the crossbow damage choosing improved critical, or even I could choose an extra metamagic skill. Not sure! :S<br/>\n<br/>\nI take epic weapon focus at 23 (+2) but I could exchange it for another more interesting feat...<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout SP, I decided to take the trickery advantage, training the basic rogue skills.
