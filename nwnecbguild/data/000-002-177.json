Amazing resource!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what happened to World of Greyhawk?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only one I see on EE is a 1-20 server, and frankly, I'd still play there on pre-epic builds if they had their hacks set up to download automatically to mobile devices.<br/>\n<br/>\nGhost Tower of Inverness and White Plume Mountain are my #1 &amp; 2 favorite modules.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The pacifist juggernaut - just a shame PM means it can't be good aligned (but no point reopening a long-running sore). A stunning take, the like of which I have not seen before.
