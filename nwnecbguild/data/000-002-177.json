      "content": "<div>How do you play it? Without armor (or very limited armor by choosing a light armor feat and risking arcane spell failure) you might be thinking you'll play it the way everyone is playing the Magus anyways: focus on rapier, taking weapon finesse feat and pushing up dexterity.....<br/>\n.. WRONG!!! ..\u00a0<br/>\nWe are playing a magical weapon master who has dedicated attack, power and defense to a single weapon (gaining Chosen Weapon lvl1), using her/his intelligence through study and exercise (gaining Canny Defense feat lvl1) to put this into practice. So what we want to do, at the start and early game (1-4) is \"meditate\" on our practice (push for high intelligence). At lvl 4, training in our art will bear fruit (gaining perfect strike feat) so choosing a weapon with powerful potential is ideal.</div>"

So you're exchanging monk apr for 1.5x damage p/hit. It's also handy that monk gives you so many free feats (IKD and Cleave for example) when WM requires so many largely useless ones.

It does help that level twenty Monks are immune to a ton of things as well... <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the weapon used, it is a personal choice, kamas are effective for sure but what is life without some style? ;)</div>"

      "content": "<div>I love them. But they're more off-tank material through the mid-levels. Your HP is going to be low for a front-liner for much of the build. The more monk you want, the more difficult it gets to bring on line. But, honestly, the more you simply wade through to dice people once it does. Also because you're going to deal with the same issues as STR-based Monks: You're MAD as Pandemonium for most of the build. WIS for AC and Saving throws. Dex for AC or you sacrifice the monk feats you're trying to pick up. STR because, sword. You're never weak in this build, mind you. But it's not the guy I'd put in the doorway to hold the line. He's a flanker. Perfect for hunting mages and squishies then coming in to mop up. Use the speed to avoid getting stuck going toe-to-toe with heavy-armored behemoth 1v1.<br/>\n<br/>\nI build them for Aielund. Savant drops some juicy monk robes in the late game. Just when this build starts to shine. The 1st one I did as the Blademaster (though I added a couple more monk levels at the end. Stopped WM earlier.) Bonus points because Aielund has No-Dachi swords. So you can play samurai without taking the exotic feat to pick up Katana. On a PVP-friendly PW I played a couple that were more monk-based. Annoyed people to no end because their scythe-wielders could only hit me on 20. And then monk saves, so I passed Dev-Crit anyway. :P</div>"

But the Kensai kit goes back to 2nd edition AD&amp;D. So it was objectively 1st in that system. Paizo lifted it and renamed it for the archetype much later. Not that I hate Pathfinder.
