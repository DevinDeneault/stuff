      "content": "<div>Indeed, The defensive bonuses are great in almost every build, depending on the server and what classes are attractive.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's mainly the offensive component I'm interested in, as it is works superbly due to the fact that the dmg it gives, is unresistable and outright, a great undead/bosskiller mechanic.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI play on a low magic server where basically all bosses are immune to crits or have extremely high hitpoints with the settings being a max of +3 on enhancements.\u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>Just use a standard Ftr/Rog/CoT build Valkos, you can have a healthy-to-very good 45 AB and still 16 Charisma base.<br/>\nWith over 20 levels of CoT, you will have one hell of Divine Wrath &amp; great saving throws to boot. <br/>\nBeing Strength-based &amp; with EWS you don't particularly care about critical hits either. <br/>\nBase damage should be about 1d10 (Bastard sword) +6 (EWS) +12 (34 Str) +Weapon enchantments +UMD buffs such as Darkfire +PA.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck.</div>"

Both are currently residing on page 3 of the Full Epic (level 40) section.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",
