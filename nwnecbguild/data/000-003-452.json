The only thing you will get from a high wisdom here is a couple of bonus spellslots, a better will save and a stat bonus to the spot skill, a skill you don't need the moment you have the wyrmling shapes with their TS. The shapes you get will override strength, dexterity and constitution to some extent, but you want to go sword and board and not depend upon your shapes, so you will need a good strength and a fair amount of constitution. You may even want some dexterity since you don't have the cat's grace spell.<br/>\nCha 11 gives you nothing unless you improve it with items or eagle's splendor.<br/>\nMy suggestion is:<br/>\nStr 15 (20)<br/>\nDex 12<br/>\nCon 14<br/>\nWis 14<br/>\nInt 12<br/>\nCha10<br/>\nTaking Int 12 instead of 14 gives 1 less skill, maybe you can do without concentration<br/>\n<blockquote><div>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Paladin(1): Alertness, Weapon Focus: Longsword<br/>\n03: Paladin(3): Blind Fight<br/>\n06: Paladin(6): Extend Spell<br/>\n09: Paladin(9): Improved Critical: Longsword<br/>\n12: Druid(3): Spell Focus: Conjuration<br/>\n15: Shifter(1): Spell Penetration<br/>\n18: Shifter(4): Greater Spell Focus: Conjuration</div></blockquote>\nWhy all those meta magic feats? Paladin has 10 caster levels, level 2 spells and no attack spells. Druid has 5 caster levels and level 3 spells and will not be a very effective spellslinger even with such feats. Why focus in conjuration when the only conjuration attack spell is grease, while there are several evocation and necromancy attack spells and even transmutation attack spells. There are several combat feats that will serve you better.<br/>\nExtend can be of some use for buffing and can make the druid spells last equally long as the paladin spells.</div>",

      "content": "<div>An extremely nerfed combo split which is typical of RP builds so no need to fret that issue.  You should notice that this build is similar to the last one posted. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am assuming either an available alignment manager on the server or a DM to support this function.  You never<br/>\nexplained how this was to be handled when Max asked (unless I missed it).  Druid and pally are the 2 most strict<br/>\nclasses to deal with, hence the paucity of any similar combos being documented in the ECB knowledge base.<br/>\nOtherwise, you will find these switches all but impossible to enact since chaos axis changes are seldom scripted<br/>\n(at least not on those I've played).  Nonetheless...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 10-5-5 split appears to be cast in concrete according to the previous description of the RP prereqs so the<br/>\ndisplayed build reflects that.  However, if you are unfamiliar with playing shifter, let me explain that in <br/>\norder to optimize combat potential, it is normally best to decide EXACTLY which forms will be your primary<br/>\nones and support those choices.  It is impossible to excel in all forms, though each of them have their uses,<br/>\nsituationally, that is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have decided in this build that in order to maintain as high a primary class (ala Paladin) potential as possible,<br/>\nthe minotaur form would suit best.  That form gets full merge (weapon, armor, items) so the battleaxe seems<br/>\na no-brainer.  The shifter version automatically gets +1 enhancement so Bless Weapon is not needed shifted.<br/>\nLongsword focus would work with humanoid wildshape, but that is not available until Shf 7.  <br/>\nIn addition to fighting as minotaur, I recommend getting familiar with using the wyrmling breath weapons, <br/>\nso Expertise was chosen to augment AC a bit in those cases.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing to keep in mind is that minotaur shape is less likely to be KD'd than pally and cannot be disarmed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother option is to go spear-focused for drider with the +2 onhit poison spear but that is a 2h weapon and the pally<br/>\nwill lose AC equipped that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbilities<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR will get overwritten by both minotaur and wyrmling but that doesn't mean a prebuff of Bull's Str won't be just as useful as in pally form. DEX does NOT get overwritten by minotaur so the additional DEX AC is useful as well as a slight boost (-1 to 0) to the poor reflex saves.  I would be wary of traps because most of them are reflex DCs.  CON also gets overwritten by most of the wyrmlings but was set to 12 as an alternative to Toughness in a feat-starved build like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother spread worth considering is 18(23), 8, 12, 14, 12, 8... perhaps a stronger spread, though limiting the wyrmling shape.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo NOT be intimated by ODD final ability levels for 2 reasons:  1) maximum item enhancement on the server may<br/>\nfavor an odd number (EVEN ability levels assume the +12 cap can normally be reached by all players), and 2) buffs<br/>\nare a d4 dice roll so half the time (theoretically) the odd number is beneficial over the even one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would discourage any \"waste\" of spell focus feats since both the WIS and caster levels are so low that DCs will be<br/>\nrather easy to beat with or without the feats factored in.  It's a matter of poor return on your investment, IMHO.<br/>\nUse the same reasoning with Spell Pen feats.  Just too few caster levels to make it feasible and feats should be<br/>\nbetter utilized.  I am assuming there are no RP constraints regarding feat selection, naturally.<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line on the entire discussion:  Decide how much you want to play the shifter (and/or druid) shapes, decide on a primary and secondary shape focus and then begin planning your build.  Any other approach will be similar to throwing a dart at a board blind-folded (even with Blind Fight   ).<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladin(10), Druid(5), Shifter(5), Human<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 17 (22)<br/>\nDEX: 10<br/>\nCON: 12<br/>\nWIS: 14<br/>\nINT: 13<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Pal-1 WF: Battleaxe, Blind Fight<br/>\n02: Pal-2<br/>\n03: Pal-3  Power Attack<br/>\n04: Pal-4  STR+1 (18)<br/>\n05: Pal-5<br/>\n06: Pal-6  Cleave<br/>\n07: Pal-7<br/>\n08: Pal-8  STR+1 (19)<br/>\n09: Pal-9  Alertness<br/>\n10: Dru-1  *Alignment Change*<br/>\n11: Dru-2<br/>\n12: Dru-3  STR+1 (20), Extend Spell <br/>\n13: Dru-4<br/>\n14: Dru-5<br/>\n15: Shf-1  Imp Crit: Battleaxe<br/>\n16: Shf-2  STR+1 (21)<br/>\n17: Shf-3<br/>\n18: Shf-4  Expertise (See Note for Options)<br/>\n19: Shf-5<br/>\n20: Pal-10  STR+1 (22), *Alignment Change*<br/>\n<br/>\nHP: 200<br/>\nSaves(F/WR) 16/9/9 (19/12/12 vs. spells)<br/>\nSave bonuses: Fear: +2<br/>\nBAB: 16<br/>\nAB (max, naked) 23 (melee), 17 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only) 13/24<br/>\nSpell Casting: Pal(2),Dru(3)<br/>\n<br/>\nSkills<br/>\nAnimal Empathy 22(21), Discipline 23(29), Heal 11(12), Listen 22(25), Spellcraft 14(15), Tumble 10(11)<br/>\n<br/>\nNote:  <br/>\n<br/>\nOther suitable feats at Lvl 18 might be KD (for pally) or Imp Crit: Unarmed (for greater support of miscellaneous shifter and druid forms).<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit:  Fixed ability spread.
