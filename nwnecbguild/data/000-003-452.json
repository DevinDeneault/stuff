And here it is. With your high WIS, you won't need Spell Focus, and the Spell Penetration feats make you penetrate as if you were a pure level 30 Cleric. Zen Archery was my solution for how to get a good AB.<br/>\nI just noticed that if you replace those last 2 Great WIS feats with Epic Prowess and Armor Skin, you would get the same AB and +2 AC, at the cost of -1 DC for your spells and a couple fewer spells per day, and -1 on Will saves.

How about Fighter 4 then? WS, EWS, and 2 more bonus feats? CoT for 2 feats and the saves boost? IMO, as I said, almost always there is benefit of adding a 3rd class. The OP PMed me about it that he would read the game guides section and learn the craft, so he's already pointed in the right direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

But, RP is a whole different thing. I am not and cannot argue in favor of RP-oriented build choices, as it's a very personal thing. I know someone, for example, who never takes KD or IKD with Paladins because he says knocking your enemies down is unlawful. However, the fact remains that KD and IKD will make a Paladin build stronger, regardless of RP.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that this is the ECB, we specialize in building powerful toons here, which sometimes, depending on some players' interpretation of RP, can be against character, but from a powergaming point of view, which is the one we emphasize here, the rule should definitely be \"always add a third class if you want to build EPIC characters\". Perhaps we could add a PS at the end, something along the lines of: \"uness you are going for a RP concept and wish to just make the best possible build within a certain concept\".<br/>\n<br/>\nI was gonna say some other things, but I gotta go to work. This could be a nice topic for discussion in the General Discussion forum, maybe I'll start a thread there when I have time to avoid derailing this topic here from what the OP intended it to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
