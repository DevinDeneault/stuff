      "content": "<div>You understand it correctly.  Even with IKD, gnomes and halflings can, at best, KD large hostiles.<br/>\n<br/>\nTBH, my halflings use just plain 'ol KD for sneaking on mages and clerics.  If they can find a \"spare\" feat which is rare, then IKD would be a luxury (naturally, a monk like this gets both for free so no issue on that score). The amount of damage a dexer typically is comparatively low compared to a STR build.  For a DevCritter... different story.  Very handy to get \"free\" crit attempts in so would go with a medium race in that case.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith an uber AC toon like this, most foes will miss without being prone anyway (except, as I already stated, those dang mages &amp; clerics).   <br/>\n<br/>\nWith dual kamas, halfling makes a lot of sense, especially as a stealther (best race for that).  Unarmed attack, I would rethink the options a bit more.</div>"

It's looking like a dexer monk/cleric/rogue of some sort from your former hints. \n<blockquote><div>\nOpinions on which of the 2 races to pick would be nice </div></blockquote>\nYou only mentioned 1 race so far.  What's the other, human?  Elf?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt depends on how you intend to implement KD.  In mobs, IMO, KD is a waste since you will be continually flanked and that 1 round buys you little (again, for dexer w/o DevCrit).   With single opponents, it's effective.  KD has extremely limited use vs. bosses who are often KD-immune and/or high discipline/high STR creatures.  But this depends on the magic level of the environment to some degree.  On very high magic PWs, KD is essentially a wasted feat altogether since too many monsters have been customized to be KD immune.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless you just like KDing baseline creatures and other low discipline/low STR enemies.  Then it has some merit in high magic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am also assuming you are considering only PvM with your question rather than against the polymorph forms of other PCs.</div>"

This is tied in with your original question about the value of the halfling +AC/+AB/+saves tradeoff vs. KDing huge foes.  The additional 4 monk levels addresses this issue +AC/+saves without sacrificing the KD range, essentially empowering the non-halfling with the same hin boni plus faster speed.\n<blockquote><div> i''d rather have more rogue levels then and pick up impr evasion with one of those. \n</div></blockquote>\nThat's an option, but other than Crippling Strike, the only other bonus feats that appeal to me in a build like this is ISA.  For a cleric/monk, Will saves should not be an issue.  One thing to watch is that your HP is very low for a melee toon.  With ED you won't be getting hit as often, but when you do, it will hurt with less than 400 HP.  More rogue levels= lower HP total.   Pray that your cleric buffs hold (Endurance, specifically) or it may get hairy, especially if flanked by sneakers and/or DAer's.  I would feel more comfortable with War domain but apparently that isn't an option on your server.  Also, if choosing only one metamagic feat, I would choose Empowered for the added power-up.  I would rather crit twice as often than rely on extended spells, my preference.\n<blockquote><div>Your 2 AB gain is really nice though, but the armor skin feels lackluster since it already goes to around 70+ AC and has epic dodge to boot.</div></blockquote>\nAgain... back to your original question about the halfling race boni.

For a cleric/monk, Will saves should not be an issue.  One thing to watch is that your HP is very low for a melee toon.  With ED you won't be getting hit as often, but when you do, it will hurt with less than 400 HP.  More rogue levels= lower HP total.   Pray that your cleric buffs hold (Endurance, specifically) or it may get hairy, especially if flanked by sneakers and/or DAer's.

      "content": "<div><blockquote><div><strong>foojin wrote:</strong>--snip-- <br/>\nalso i already get haste as well so speed is not an issue.\n</div></blockquote>\nI like being able to rely on permaspeed boost when the haste wears off or if i can't find any hasted items.  Besides, it stacks with haste tho return on investment quickly diminishes after 130% .  Without maxed stealth, move speed will become more important since it is your only way out of sticky situations with such low HPs.  I suppose Darkness is another decent retreat tactic.\n<blockquote><div>\nWar/Trickery is an option, but i know that i will get maxed out dex/wis gear and at least +8 in con. Also i liked my TS on level3, better summons and a few other nice spells to boot.\n</div></blockquote>\nI never build around gear.  Just ask Max!    Actually, I would sooner swap out Plant domain as, apparently, AC is a non-issue for this toon.  Cleric 17 could reduce Search &amp; DT investment by 9 each and gain some concealment to combine with ED.\n<blockquote><div>\nLost slippery mind and some rogue levels on this.</div></blockquote> <br/>\nWhat use a toon would have for SM with at least 5 cleric levels and WIS 13 is beyond me.  Of all the rogues I've ever built I have never once taken Slippery Mind and never missed it.  Either clarity potions or mind immune items usually abound even if the direct spell isn't available.  All that gets lost from more rogue levels are SA's or ISA feats, IMO.\n<blockquote><div>\ni hope by getting my longterm stats from gear and having allot of shortterm buff spells/day + haste for fast rebuffing helps to manage this<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"> [re:dispelled buffs]</span> problem a bit. And yes the AB concern was for certain bosses.\n</div></blockquote>\nThen, if you can depend on reaching the AB cap via items and the ability cap +6, 38 should be fine to hit the majority of enemies.  I wouldn't waste time trying to rebuff against uber AC bosses since all you will do is lose at least a round and hence more chances to roll 20's.  Most important (IMO) is crit range.  When you DO finally hit, it would be to your best advantage to crit.  Imp Crit is essential against tough bosses, especially those with high DR.  For a crap weapon type like a kama it should be automatic.\n<blockquote><div>I took 28 ranks because with a +10 disable trap ring i can disable epic ones.</div></blockquote>\nMakes sense.  And your current Search level is also perfect for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll 'n all, looks decent to me and you can still KD those dragons &amp; fire giants.</div>"

But there are other ways of dealing with fear like Protection from Alignment (yes, you can quickslot both evil AND good versions if you like... handy against those gold dragons with fear aura), any of the Lesser/Mind Blank scrolls (may as well start using that UMD investment, eh?) and believe it or not, if your cleric can brew potions of Remove Fear he can actually drink a potion while feared and cure himself.  But the spell itself won't target while feared.  Just a few ways of bypassing fear without pally levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree, though.  Fear is one of the most annoying spells in the game which is why I never cast it and spend the next 10 minutes chasing all the enemies around the screen trying to swat them.  They could have at least halved the dang duration.</div>"

I didn't know it was possible to drink potions while frightened. I could have sworn that I tried drinking potions of clarity in the OC while getting chased around the warrens by a mummy in the Beggar's Nest. That would be a very handy thing to know. Or, is this specific to a PW and I missed the context earlier in the thread?<br/>\n<br/>\nI totally agree that Fear can be very annoying, both as a user and a victim. I was looking for a nice mid-level spell for crowd control that would take advantage of my wizard's GSF:Necromancy. I quickly relegated Fear for use when I am in real trouble since chasing mobs all over the map gets tedious in a hurry. It's also a problem with undead encounters when traveling with a cleric henchie.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, regarding failing saves versus fear auras and so on, I have gotten lucky a couple times with stealthy characters who weren't already in combat by going into stealth mode when entering (or being impinged upon by) the fear aura. My character ran around a corner (out of line of sight) and the baddy stopped following until I regained control. Not reliable, by any means, and possibly only effective since I was hasted, but it's at least some chance of being able to wait out the storm and it costs nothing to use.</div>"
