I thought 460+ HP was enough and can be buffed further by items or spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nCraft wand is there so you can spam improved invisibility, bulls strength (erm I'm still learning how to use this feat) on teammates.<br/>\n<br/>\nSet trap 9 modified is in there to boost disable trap but also to allow one to set deadly traps with items, one with the land scrolls/spells or capping dexterity but hopefully someone else can do that for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny single handed weapon will be good for this build, the best weapons will slashing weapons so you can cast keen weapon on it, but in some environments this is not necessarily that important. I've chosen longsword to give the character a more knightly look but scimitars are probably more optimal with their crit range in a Str build with WS/EWS.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've dropped the AB a bit and increased Cons for more tankability but I wanted the AB high enough so that it would also be enjoyable as a solo character. I figured a base AB of 38 combined with Bard Song / Curse Song, Bardic buffs (ie Bull's Str) and UMD should be able to do the task. I wasn't prepared to drop the AB further in a build with undispellable improved invisibility to include armor skin however.<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven't maxed Taunt in this build although one could swap Concentration for Taunt if desired, its maxed in this build to grant taunt resistance.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Bard(27), Fighter(6), Rogue(7), Human\n\nDEX: 8\nWIS: 8\nCHA: 14 (16)\nHuman: (Quick to Master)\n02: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus: Longsword\n04: Rogue(2): CON+1, {Evasion}, (CON=16)\n06: Bard(1): Curse Song\n08: Bard(2): CON+1, (CON=17)\n10: Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}\n12: Bard(5): CON+1, Improved Critical: Longsword, (CON=18)\n14: Bard(7)\n16: Rogue(4): STR+1, (STR=17)\n18: Bard(10): Still Spell\n20: Bard(12): STR+1, (STR=18)\n22: Fighter(5)\n24: Bard(13): CHA+1, Epic Prowess, (CHA=15)\n26: Bard(15)\n28: Bard(17): STR+1, (STR=19)\n30: Rogue(6): Great Strength I, (STR=20)\n32: Bard(20): STR+1, (STR=21)\n34: Bard(22)\n36: Bard(24): STR+1, Great Strength III, (STR=24)\n38: Rogue(7)\n40: Bard(27): STR+1, (STR=26)\nHitpoints: 464\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 23/19/22\nBAB: 26\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 17/28\nAlignment Changes: 0\nConcentration 43(47), Disable Trap 40(44), Discipline 43(51), Listen 43(42), Open Lock 1(0), Perform 43(56), Search 8(10), Set Trap 8(9), Spellcraft 33(35), Tumble 40(39), UMD 27(30)\n\n02: Concentration(5), Discipline(5), Save(14),\u00a0\n04: Disable Trap(3), Listen(3), Search(2), Set Trap(2), Tumble(3), UMD(3), Save(12),\u00a0\n06: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(2), Perform(1), Spellcraft(7), Tumble(2), UMD(2), Save(4),\u00a0\n08: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Perform(3), Spellcraft(3), Tumble(2), UMD(2), Save(2),\u00a0\n10: Disable Trap(6), Search(2), Set Trap(2), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n12: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n14: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(2), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n16: Disable Trap(6), Listen(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(2),\u00a0\n18: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n20: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Spellcraft(4), UMD(1),\u00a0\n22: Concentration(2), Discipline(2), Save(1),\u00a0\n24: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Tumble(3), UMD(3), Save(2),\u00a0\n26: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(3), Save(4),\u00a0\n28: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(2), Perform(3),\u00a0\n30: Disable Trap(9), Listen(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n32: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(1), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n34: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(3),\u00a0\n36: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(2),\u00a0\n38: Disable Trap(7), Listen(3), Save(1),\u00a0\n40: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(3),\u00a0\n</details>\n<br/>\nI found 5 B/F/R builds with more than 14 levels in bard in the ECB archives:<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Matches found: 5\nThe Halfling Mousquetaire\u00a0bard 21 / rogue 13 / fighter 6\u00a0(halfling)\u00a0by lendorallen\nDashing Bladesinger\u00a0rogue 16 / fighter 4 / bard 20\u00a0(elf)\u00a0by CaZin0</details>\n\nMaximillan Kane wrote a\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/jack-of-all-trades-bard-16-rogue-16-fighter-8-t2343394.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jack of All Trades</a>\u00a0build, Bard 16 / Rogue 16 / Fighter 8 in the current ECB forum which is dexterity based.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway thanks for reading this far. This is still a design concept, haven't play tested it yet, and haven't made any primary class bard builds before but this is looking unique and might be quite a nice party member to have, whilst being effective enough as a soloist.

Thanks for posting and welcome to the ECB forum!<br/>\nI think your idea might be ok if one is playing for maximal lvl 40 power and in your environment you can get the perform skill up to 100 with items to improve bard song +6 AC -&gt; +7 AC or curse song -6 -&gt; -7 AC.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are downsides to such an approach and overall I felt it was best not to chase this.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a heavy investment for a small bonus and you might get more out of other magic properties from items. Single player modules\u00a0where exp is limited there will be exp penalties, and parties in pre-epic levels will suffer from not having your search skill and disable traps skills available. There will also be a lot of skill points lost including the large boost to skill points from taking rogue at level 1.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway hope this explains my thoughts adequately, and once again welcome!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Good to have on your team paired up with some RDD dev crit monsters (1/2-orc Fighter Bard RDD (28/2/10) for highest DC). No big need for AC, making other equipment choices much more open. For PvE you might perhaps want to get in Evasion (depending on module/server monsters).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
