However, I've tried to keep the XP penalty at a minimum.\u00a0 Figure -20% XP from 15 to 22 and again 35 to end (actually a few levels -40% as well; see the leveling guide to find out when that happens).\u00a0 No way around it really.<br/>\n<br/>\n The monk/rogue combo is a natural ED bias so I built that way.\u00a0 With the divine buffs, both AB and damage should be greater than typical non-preisty Dexers plus you'll get 7d6 sneaks against susceptible targets (and Crippling Strike... late in epic).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n This is a DW schedule.\u00a0 I'm figuring robes w/2 kamas but you could choose any finessable weapon theoretically.\u00a0 However, except for kamas, you'll lose the monk progression which pretty much defeats the reason to take that class in the first place.\u00a0 There is no room for both metamagic and DW in such a feat-starved combo.\u00a0 That should not come as a surprise.\u00a0 However, you could bypass DW altogether, just stick with a single kama (no shield, of course) and take Extend and Empower (plus a spare pre-epic feat) which will increase the effectiveness of your buffs.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n You should have no problem reaching the AB cap with those high-magic weapons and divine buffs (need I list them all??).\u00a0 That means AB 57.\u00a0 If you can max Dex enhancements, that translates to another 6 AB or 63 total which will hit an AC of 53 or lower at least half of the attacks.\u00a0 DW kamas with ImpTWF and Flurry will be in the neighborhood of 8APR non-hasted, no divine power... so you can add 2 more to that total when buffed with those effects.<br/>\n<br/>\n The overall layout is:<br/>\n<br/>\n Monk(12), Rogue(13), Cleric(15), Elf<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 10<br/>\n DEX: 18 (26)<br/>\n CON: 12<br/>\n WIS: 14 (18)<br/>\n INT: 14<br/>\n CHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n Monk12 achieves Diamond Soul.

That's why I stuck one of the DW feats there. TWF is a better choice. I agree.<br/>\n But I disagree about delaying ImpCrit.\u00a0 It is unaffected by AB (you can roll a 19 or 20 regardless of your AB).\u00a0 I always get ImpCrit asap because it doubles crit opps regardless of weapon. Keen Edge scrolls further enhance the importance of early ImpCrit in any UMD build (or keen weapons for that matter).<br/>\n<br/>\n I completely agree about how to time when it is appropriate to start DWing.\u00a0 I consider ImpTWF the least useful of the three and often bypass it altogether (if feat-starved) since it adds a -5 BAB\u00a0 attack (yes, for monk also) and in early levels essentially a guaranteed miss.\u00a0 If the toon is having trouble hitting at all with DW, ImpTWF won't help other than 1 more chance at rolling a 20.<br/>\n<br/>\n Bottom line in this build is that DW is a forced fit and, really, not a necessary one.\u00a0 Without fighter or CoT BAB early on, everything gets delayed far beyond what it should be.\u00a0 The main reason I went DW is due to monk's reliance on robes with no shield.\u00a0 That empty hand could be doing something more than waving in the breeze, hence the impetus to DW. Throwing the racial curve into the mix further strangles what could have been an otherwise more conventional implementation of this particular class split.<br/>\n<br/>\n I've revised the leveling guide to include those suggestions that seem most reasonable and leave it to the OP to decide how to custom fit it according to his environment.</div>"
