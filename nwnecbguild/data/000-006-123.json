The Furyondy armies are either too pre-occupied, or too busy.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn urgent council meeting is held, all potential options are discussed, and it appears the tribe is cornered by the forces of Iuz. The only way out, is to cut their way through the Orcish Armies led by the Battlepriests of Iuz. The supplies of Red Dragon Wyrmling blood are collected by Aelynthi from all the villagers for safe keeping and kept on her person. The commander in chief of the Calarel tribe, Aelynthi's oldest brother,\u00a0Elnaril\u00a0volunteers to undergo the transfusion ritual, for the sake of his homeland, scheduled for the next morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet, unbeknownst to all in attendance, an agent of Iuz was amongst the council meeting.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nNeglected and forgotten by their family and tribe in the blinding eminence of the siblings Elnaril and Aelynthi, the youngest brother\u00a0Ehrendil watches with disdain at his elder siblings 'heroic' actions.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nBullied by Elnaril through his upbringing, and constant arguments with Aelynthi about his unorthodox and at times unethical 'ways', he has only experienced bitterness and injury to his ego. Slinking out stealthly from the meeting, he approaches a forest glade, and weave a mystic sigil on a rotten decaying tree stump.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd out of the fog of the misty forest, the image of Grand Battle-Priestess Halga the Oppressor of the Greater Boneheart Order of Iuz appears.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nClad in vestments of rust red, trimmed in black and wielding an ebon staff bound\u00a0in silver with a sliver set skull, she smiles as she promises the traitorous Ehrendil protection, power, wealth and privilege in exchange for information on the villages defences.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Ehrendil, no sense of loyalty remaining to his family, his village or homeland through the neglect over decades and centuries of an elven lifespan, doesn't hesitate, for in his own mind there is only the villages' destruction to the forces of Iuz, and this is his only ticket for survival. His sister's plan of magical red dragon blood saving them just sounds insane.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhispering the villages plans to Halga,\u00a0the Favourite of Iuz smiles broadly. But then Ehrendil notices her smile vanish.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nHalga whispers to him, and combined with his elven keen senses he knows someone is listening. Halga silently weaves an incantation, and his dagger starts to burn with a radiant blue fire. Coldfire he recalls, the incantation cast. Halga looks at him and nods. Without even turning he throws the dagger at the person watching him.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he sees his sister Aelynthi falling from the trees, dagger in her chest, screaming with all the bardic might she can muster, the dagger barely missing her heart, but a mortal wound nonetheless.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing his least detested sibling lying on the ground he feels a twang of guilt briefly, then sighs. There is nothing left for him in this village anymore.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nHalga beckons to him, weaves a second incantation, and a yawning portal opens. Time to collect your reward, she smiles. And the arriving elven forces, look startled as there is a flash of light high in the treetops.\u00a0Ehrendil vanishes, with no plan to ever return, and believing his tribe will shortly be utterly devastated into oblivion.<br/>\n<br/>\nElnaril glances at her fallen sister, the icy chill of the cold fire starting to spread across her torso, death imminent.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nShe glances at him, opening her right hand containing the vial of red dragon wyrmling blood, and the transfusion instrument.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n'Let me go' she says. 'Save the village with this power, do it now'.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Elnaril grasps the vial and transfusion instrument from his sibling, his ally over centuries, his stauchest and loyalist advocate in the village.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nHe owes her so much, over so many years...<br/>\n<br/>\nHe sees her slowly slip into unconsciousness...\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nParadoxically smiling, for she believes he is destined to become their saviour, the villages fate safe with the greatest elven general the Verve forest has ever known<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he primes the transfusion instrument...\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n...and plunges it into her heart.<br/>\n<br/>\nA glowing fire starts to burn around her, cleansing away the demonic coldfire robbing her of her life force. Draconic scales start to meld into her skin.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe elven clerics begin to chant healing magic.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in the silent darkness of night, Aelynthi's condition stabilises.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n.....<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElnaril\u00a0has a sleepless night. Watching for signs of his sisters recovery, praying for signs of his sisters recovery.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nHe could have doomed the entire village at the expense of his sisters life. He was just so selfish, he berates himself. He couldn't let go.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nHe prays to Corellion, to Selene, to all the gods he knows that she awakens before dawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd before sunrise her eyes open. She glances sadly at her brother.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n'You have saved my life' Aelynthi says, 'but I am no warrior. The power of the Red Dragon Blood is wasted on me. We may all die anyway.'<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Elnaril\u00a0grins, the grin she knows he does when he is outmatched, outnumbered and with no chance of escape.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith her keen senses hears the warcries and footsteps of the advancing humanoids of Iuz, hellbent on destroying her home, miles away, but approaching.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Elnaril\u00a0takes her hand and places it on his legendary longbow\u00a0Mirathyra. Its nickname, 'The Slayer of Thousands'.<br/>\n<br/>\n'For the next 12 hours, this longbow belongs to you. Its time you join our forces in battle. And see if this Draconic Blood is any good to us.'<br/>\n<br/>\nGrasping Elnaril's hand, Aelynthi attempts to stand and does so with surprising strength, knocking the muscular Elnaril to the ground as she pulls herself up. She hears Elnaril gently chuckle as he dusts himself off and stands.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as they leave through the door of their abode, she sees the sun is rising in the sky, she hears the birds sing, she smells the familar scent of her home. And as the powerful warmth of the sun falls upon her, she feel her blood stir. The cold, dormant, reptilian power of the red dragon line is starting to surge within her...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd she is ready to defend her homeland...<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Features:</strong><br/>\nAB 53 with mundane longbow<br/>\n6 attacks per round with Rapid Shot and Haste<br/>\n+12 arrow enchantment<br/>\nDevastating Critical (Base DC 37)<br/>\n350hp, AC 34 without items<br/>\nBard Song, UMD to use any spell in the game<br/>\nSet Trap 15 to use and retrieve nearly all deadly traps with no chance of failure (with bard song and a Cat's Grace potion)<br/>\nCalled Shot and Blind Fight<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Weaknesses\u00a0</strong><br/>\n- lowish HP for a warrior (offset by being a ranged character, high AC, buffs and summons from UMD)<br/>\n- spellcasters (offset by being able to dev crit them from a distance, and UMD for invisibility / greater sanctuary / mantles / breaches / Mords etc)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Credits:</strong><br/>\nValerfor for helping improve the build in many ways<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Aelynthi, the Deadly\u00a0(Bard 7 / Arcane Archer 23 / RDD 10)</strong><br/>\nNon Lawful<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 16 (25)<br/>\nDEX: 18 (30)<br/>\nCON: 10 (12)<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 10 (12)<br/>\nCHA: 12 (14)<br/>\n<br/>\nElf: (Hardiness vs. Enchantments, Keen Sense, Low-light Vision, Skill Affinity: Listen, Skill Affinity: Search, Skill Affinity: Spot, Sleeplessness)<br/>\n01: Bard(1): Point Blank Shot<br/>\n02: Bard(2)<br/>\n03: Bard(3): Weapon Focus (Longbow)<br/>\n04: Bard(4): DEX+1, (DEX=19)<br/>\n05: Bard(5)<br/>\n06: Red Dragon Disciple(1): Rapid Shot<br/>\n07: Red Dragon Disciple(2): (STR=18)<br/>\n08: Red Dragon Disciple(3): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br/>\n09: Red Dragon Disciple(4): Called Shot, (STR=20)<br/>\n10: Arcane Archer(1)<br/>\n11: Arcane Archer(2)<br/>\n12: Arcane Archer(3): DEX+1, Improved Critical (Longbow), (DEX=21)<br/>\n13: Arcane Archer(4)<br/>\n14: Arcane Archer(5)<br/>\n15: Arcane Archer(6): Blind Fight<br/>\n16: Arcane Archer(7): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br/>\n17: Arcane Archer(8)<br/>\n18: Arcane Archer(9): Power Attack<br/>\n19: Bard(6)<br/>\n20: Arcane Archer(10): DEX+1, (DEX=23)<br/>\n21: Red Dragon Disciple(5): Cleave<br/>\n22: Red Dragon Disciple(6)<br/>\n23: Red Dragon Disciple(7): (CON=12)<br/>\n24: Red Dragon Disciple(8): DEX+1, Great Cleave, (DEX=24)<br/>\n25: Red Dragon Disciple(9): (INT=12)<br/>\n26: Red Dragon Disciple(10): {Darkvision}, (STR=24), (CHA=14)<br/>\n27: Arcane Archer(11): Great Strength I, (STR=25)<br/>\n28: Arcane Archer(12): DEX+1, (DEX=25)<br/>\n29: Arcane Archer(13)<br/>\n30: Arcane Archer(14): Devastating Critical (Longbow), Overwhelming Critical (Longbow)<br/>\n31: Arcane Archer(15)<br/>\n32: Arcane Archer(16): DEX+1, (DEX=26)<br/>\n33: Arcane Archer(17): Epic Weapon Focus (Longbow)<br/>\n34: Arcane Archer(18): Epic Prowess<br/>\n35: Arcane Archer(19)<br/>\n36: Arcane Archer(20): DEX+1, Armor Skin, (DEX=27)<br/>\n37: Bard(7)<br/>\n38: Arcane Archer(21)<br/>\n39: Arcane Archer(22): Great Dexterity I, Great Dexterity II, (DEX=29)<br/>\n40: Arcane Archer(23): DEX+1, (DEX=30)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 350<br/>\nSkillpoints: 167<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 24/21/33<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +4, Mind Effects: +2<br/>\nBAB: 27<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 35 (melee), 53 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 34/37<br/>\nSpell Casting: Bard(3)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nDisable Trap 1(2), Listen 43(44), Lore 8(16), Open Lock 1(11), Perform 11(13), Search 7(10), Set Trap 3(13), Spellcraft 20(21), Tumble 40(50), UMD 28(30)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Lore(4), Open Lock(1), Perform(2), Tumble(4), UMD(4),\u00a0<br/>\n02: Lore(1), Perform(3),\u00a0<br/>\n03: Lore(1), Perform(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0<br/>\n04: Lore(1), Perform(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0<br/>\n05: Lore(1), Perform(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0<br/>\n06: Search(2),\u00a0<br/>\n07: Search(2),\u00a0<br/>\n08: Search(2),\u00a0<br/>\n09: Search(1), Save(1),\u00a0<br/>\n10: Disable Trap(1), Set Trap(1), Save(1),\u00a0<br/>\n11: Set Trap(2), Save(1),\u00a0<br/>\n12: Listen(2), Save(3),\u00a0<br/>\n13: Save(7),\u00a0<br/>\n14: Save(11),\u00a0<br/>\n15: Save(15),\u00a0<br/>\n16: Save(19),\u00a0<br/>\n17: Save(23),\u00a0<br/>\n18: Save(27),\u00a0<br/>\n19: Perform(3), Tumble(14), UMD(14),\u00a0<br/>\n20: Listen(4),\u00a0<br/>\n21: Listen(2),\u00a0<br/>\n22: Listen(2),\u00a0<br/>\n23: Listen(2),\u00a0<br/>\n24: Listen(2),\u00a0<br/>\n25: Listen(2),\u00a0<br/>\n26: Listen(3),\u00a0<br/>\n27: Listen(5),\u00a0<br/>\n28: Listen(4), Save(1),\u00a0<br/>\n29: Save(6),\u00a0<br/>\n30: Save(11),\u00a0<br/>\n31: Save(16),\u00a0<br/>\n32: Save(21),\u00a0<br/>\n33: Save(26),\u00a0<br/>\n34: Save(31),\u00a0<br/>\n35: Save(36),\u00a0<br/>\n36: Save(41),\u00a0<br/>\n37: Spellcraft(20), Tumble(19), UMD(7),\u00a0<br/>\n38: Listen(5),\u00a0<br/>\n39: Listen(5),\u00a0<br/>\n40: Listen(5),\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

There's also the case the builder tries for the perma-song/un-dispellable, especially useful for group play in low/medium PWs.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
