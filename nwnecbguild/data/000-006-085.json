Dragonborn Ranger is a dual-wielding dragon blade, the rest of the series being comprised of Fighter/RDD and Barbarian/RDDs, which series explores synergies as such of the melee classes with RDD. </div></blockquote>\n<strong>Concept:</strong>  Dragon Blades were an elite fighting force, comprised of combat warriors who actually rode and fought upon dragons; the pair, rider and dragon, were dedicated to the preservation and defense of a far-away land, which few if any mortals from middle-earth have ever been known to visit. It is said the bond between dragon and his/her rider is a strong and magical one. It is also said that, in time, the bond between a rider and his/her dragon grows, such that they begin to \u201csee\u201d and \u201cthink\u201d as one, with the one eventually taking on characteristics of the other. It is widely believed all Dragon Blades (and their dragons) died out during the time of the dragon wars. <br/>\n<br/>\nThey are wrong: a few survived.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Pros and Cons:</strong><br/>\nDual Wield, fully Bane-Charged (which comes on nice and early, too), high RDD STR with a high/PG Naked AB 50, +1 Song: 51 (55 self-buffed, -2 dual), and a double weapon focus for the delivery of different damage types. Decent AC, especially for STR-based, dual wielder (better AC in light leather dual wielding than enjoys \u201cgood warrior\u201d in full plate with tower, there being room in light leather for even more AC from DEX (unlike plate), with Striker able to put on the big board for even more, too, thus a really decent AC for a dual wield melee especially, thanks of course to bard and RDD). As if not more importantly, enjoys over 500 HPs (534 in fact, such that Striker ain\u2019t exactly afraid of a little heat); this, even although with this AB/damage, heh, dead don't strike back, eh? (Still nice to have on a dual-wielder, in combination with over 500HPs as here, such that defense has not been overlooked).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso has a really decent skillset, especially nice for a melee, including (your choice) deadly traps or UMD, enjoying the good (non-dispellable) Ranger book along with a useful pet (bear or panther), too. While there\u2019s no such thing as too much saves, saves are really quite decent across the board, bolstered by Ranger spells and RDD immunities [i.e. has a really nice fort, but not so much will, and which you\u2019ll shore up via clarity potions as is rather typical of melee builds). <br/>\n<br/>\nCombo makes for a very strong melee, a level 40 build that is playable/versatile, too. And proof positive once and for all that bane-charged, strength-based Ranger\u2019s nothing short of a deadly lethal melee combatant (especially when bolstered by RDD as here!); slices through foes like there's no tomorow while whistling a tune, with great looking dragon wings, too (which wings just happen to be red, so just in time for X-Mas!).

In terms of PvM/E, sneak/crit immunes (undeads, constructs) are always a good choice, and if looking to play the OC (without giving away any spoilers) add humans, dwarves and elves. Otherwise, suit to taste. <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Weapon Note:</strong> Weapons are a matter of personal choice. I recommend kukri along with either the dire mace or heavy flail for the dishing of different physical damage types PvM/E, and for PvP either dev.crit dual wield kukri \u2013OR- Two-Bladed Sword if dev.crit\u2019s banned. To help you decide what\u2019s best for you, various weaponry damage outputs/configurations are set out in the \u201cCombat Vitals\u201d section, below. <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>* Prefer Dev.Criti instead?</strong><br/>\nNo problem. Grab kukri (tiny, dual wield weapons with wonderful crit range). Take Weapon Prof Exotic, PA, Cleave, KD, WF kukri, BF, IC: kukri, Grt.Cleave pre-epics; then, in epics: EWF/OC/DC: Kukri along with your 7 FEs and BoE as ranger bonus feats (everything in nice and early, too!), followed by Epic Fort (or AS), 2 GRT. STR and Epic Prowess (same high/PG Naked AB, etc. as posted only -40 HPs (or 488 / 496 Aid adjusted), trading in second weapon focus for a Dev Crit (DC): 44 / Bio-Cap: 50, +1 Prayer (scroll): 51!! Enjoy!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf looking to PvP your Dragonborn Ranger in an arena where dev.crit is baned, consider disarm feats instead (take two-bladed sword, large double-bladed/dual wield slashing weapon with a nice crit factor) so as to pick up disarm, improved disarm instead of WF/IC kukri pre-epics. [NB: kukri are tiny, whereas two-bladed sword is large, thus winning that game, but also gaining a nice boni--weaponry size difference contributes to your AB as well, while enjoying all your dual apr str-based, fully bane charged damage as well! Also, on dropping EWF kukri, take either ESF: Discipline, +10 Disc (recommended) or another save boost such as Epic Refl (+4 refl if prefer, even though you already enjoy Ranger's Freedom, fire immunity, etc.), or other feats of your own choosing instead. <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Strength Note:</strong> I stopped at 38 STR on purpose; while easy to grab 2 more STR (drop EP and AS for it et voila: Naked STR 40) and an option if looking to Dev.Crit your Dragonborn Ranger [exact same high/PG AB as posted, with +1 Dev.Crit DC (a Naked DC 45 / Bio-Cap: 51, +1 Prayer: 52), +1 damage and -2 AC], but not really recommended PvM/E otherwise: a mere damage point is not exactly something that Dragonborn Ranger needs (hardly!), and where real HPs in combination with AS will do you better--i.e., the +2 AC from AS alone covers off difference b/w Plate and Light Armor when DEX caps on armor are factored in, thus dual wielding/chewing through minions en route to the \u201cBig Boss\u201d (with your choice: deadly traps and/or UMD, along with ranger spells and a useful pet), making quick work of him/her as soon as you get there. Yep, no question about it: Rangers are nothing short of deadly-lethal melee combatants, but at the same time enjoy options thus versatile, indeed!!</div></blockquote>\n\nWe now return to our regularly scheduled program\u2026<br/>\n------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>III Basics:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\na) Hitpoints: 528 (534 Aid)<br/>\n<br/>\nb) Saving Throws (v Spells):<br/>\nFort: 29, +1 Song: 30 (37)<br/>\nWill: 18, +1 Song: 19 (26)<br/>\nReflex: 15, +2 Cat\u2019s: 17 (24) <br/>\n<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +7 (included in above calculations)<br/>\nOther: Ranger Spells (i.e., Freedom, Ultravision, Purge Invis.); RDD immunities (Fire, Paralysis), Etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>IV Combat Vitals:</strong><br/>\na.

There is an ability effect increase cap at +12, but no separate ability cap that a PC could ever hit. As far as I know, a PC could start with 18 strength (20 for 1/2 orcs) + 10 from regular ability increases + 8 from RDD + 7 from Great Strength feats to wind up with final base strength of 43 (45 for 1/2 orcs). With maxed bonuses from spells and items of +12, that PC could have strength of 55 (57 for 1/2 orcs).

Dual is DEFINITELY the way to go! General rule being high STR melee tend to deliver more damage per hit when cracking down with a heavy 2-hander than they do dual. Like all rules, however, there are always exceptions, especially high STR, bane-charged Rangers as is well demonstrated by Dragonborn Ranger here: namely, not only all that PG/RDD STR but ALSO epic Ranger Bane-charged FE damage, which BoE/FE when dual wielding applies full STR to both weaponry sides/hands as you say (pun fully intended!), with each and every single point of all that damage (Bane, STR, etc.) multiplying beautifully on each and every single crit, as well, and with all that apr ... heh, wave bye bye to your foe!  (thanks, Mick and Lines). <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother beauty of Bane (along with all that STR of course) is that it not only cuts through DR like there's no tomorrow (PvP and PvM/E) but also gets around the problem of sneak/crit immunes (there's zero protection against Ranger's bane, etc., and why sneak/crit immunes are always good choices PvM/E generally speaking). With 7 FEs, that be good and plenty (and then some, especially with all that high/PG RDD STR, dual wield apr, etc. and all!). In terms of PvP you'll pick humans, dwarves, half-orcs, elves, halflings, gnomes and half-elves! (All playable races covered!     ). That said, in terms of high magic worlds where lots of things have DR and/or elemental resistances, not only will you enjoy your bane-charged, high STR, dual apr damage of course, but also the ability to dish different physical damage types, too, most true. Dual enabling not only the delivery of different physical damage types but also different elemental enhancements and at the same time as well. Like having say fire and acid on one set, cold and electricity on another, thus covering everything off and regardless and which is yet another great thing about dual when it comes to high magic settings especially (arcane access and traps which come in different flavors, damage types etc. are nice, too). Of course, heh, dev.crit is definitely a (very) effective option as well, for sure, and either way wave bye bye to your foe.... (wonderful to hear, Lines, my pleasure, and enjoy!!).<br/>\n<br/>\nYep, what's not to love about epic, bane charged Ranger? Best, consistent damage in the entire game, especially when bolstered by RDD as here (just don't get any better really). Then, been telling you guys for years that Rangers are nothing short of awesome, this build being proof-positive of same! (thanks, guys).<br/>\n<strong><br/>\nTheoretical Stats and Ability Caps, etc.</strong><br/>\n@Zork: appreciate the question, and understand completely what you are saying/asking. Having returned to NWN1 (my first love!) after spending much time NWN2 side (asked to help out, which I did), I am thoroughly re-testing everything NWN1 on account of 1.69. In terms of NWN2, it's important to note many changes in terms of that game (in line with PnP) found its way into NWN1 via 1.69 (and where --NWN2--ability stats are capped, hard-coded); I assumed on account of a bunch of other stuff I read (and which I subsequently found through testing to be correct) that what others said about it was likewise correct but turns out that, while they were right about other stuff on this they are not. (Yep. Serves me right, I suppose, and which I just tested and in the OC proper!). Very sorry about that (and I'll edit the build note, accordingly). <br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of how it works, as I understood it PRE-PATCH, ability stats are \"capped\" at some theoretical number, theoretical because they're not actually obtainable (as in never); this, on account of not only the max +12 ability stat cap via magic, items, but also the character creation limitation itself--namely, the max level 40 character cap (PrC and Custom Content excepted). And yes, in terms of abilities then what you say hypothetically would be correct since ability stats a character actually \"Owns\" (as in natural ability stats from character creation stats and ability score increases, feats, racial boni, RDD boni) are just that, and which natural stats you can enhance to a max +12 via spells, items. <br/>\n<br/>\nApologize for any and all confusion, and thanks so much again everyone for your kind words, comments and praises.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlash/Crit ON! ~ Tyr<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">No, that hasn't changed, Mick. Used the term \"full strength\" loosely--as a pun of sorts--when it comes to the Epic Ranger's FE/BoE as cf. STR rules; i.e., unlike STR mod, the epic ranger's FE/BoE applies in full on main hand and off hand both, thus a double bang for your BoE/FE buck so to speak most true (well, more really, dual wield apr and all!). And yes, this is unlike the STR mod, as you say and as is documented in the build itself. (And good to be clear about all this, I agree, for the benefit of new members/players and on account of 1.69 and uh some \"confusion\" out there about it).<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>STR mod and damage--how it works:</strong><br/>\nIn brief, STR mod is applied differently depending on actual class of weapon wielded. Namely:  x1 STR MOD (or, \"full STR\" if you will) on single wielded weapon (i.e., sword+board), x1.5 large 2-hander (like heavy flail, great sword, etc.) and, in the case of dual wield, its x1 on main hand, x 1/2 on the off, yes, and regardless whether wielding 2 weapons (like two kukri, bastard sword and kukri, maces, etc.) -OR- large double-bladed/2-handed exotic like dire mace, two-bladed sword or double-axe, as set out in the build. Oh, and don't forget about the bard's contribution--song applies \"full strength\" on both blades, too! (Would say it's more of a whistle really, except that +2 damage is equivalent to the fighter's WS on its own.Thus a nice bonus, in combination with everything else of course--then, always did love 'dem bards!  ). <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Strength-Based, (fully) Bane/FE Charged Rangers Dual Wielding is Best:</strong><br/>\nWith that said, as a general \"rule\" when it comes to high STR based characters, --esp high/PG RDD STR characters like Dragonborn Ranger here!-is to pick up a large 2-hander so as to enjoy that x1.5 STR boni on same, and which Mick alludes to (it's a philosophy in general that I agree with, and something we all just tend to think about when we see high STR like this, don\u2019t we?!). But not so when it comes to the strength based, epic BoE/FE rangers though, which are indeed an exception to this \"rule\" and what this build proves and conclusively so (I do say ever so humbly).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile there's nothing wrong of course with picking up a large 2-hander like heavy flail to enjoy that 1.5x STR boni which is indeed nice (and so much nicer of course with the epic Ranger's BoE/FE!), all weapons have their place, with weaponry in general being a matter of personal choice, most true (and why it's an option as well). That said, a large 2-hander\u2019s not as nice as dual-wielding here, as the above shows; indeed, when it comes to STR based, fully Bane/FE charged epic Ranger, dual-wield is the way to go (most true!). Of course, Dragonborn Ranger does get two weapon choices, unless go dev.crit of it (which is an option, too, of course!), and in which case among other things dual apr = more crits, etc. there, too!   .<br/>\n<br/>\nYep. No matter how one slices it, STR-based rangers like Dragonborn Ranger dual wielding with the epic BoE/FE on both blades is a beautiful thing, especially when combined with the high/PG RDD STR, etc. as here!!! All this, and without neglecting i.e. defense or skills, etc. for any of it either! (Thanks again, Mick; as you know, always did love \u2018dem Rangers and RDDs also, and even better when combined as here. Combo makes for a very strong melee, level 40 (PvP) power and yet playable (1-40) PvM/E, too!! <br/>\n<br/>\nSlash/Crit ON! ~ Tyr<br/>\n<br/>\nPS Thanks again, everyone: really appreciate all the kind words, war stories, discussion, etc. And Lines, double-axe is nice, I agree. Large, dual wield slashing weapon (can be keened, better crit range than dire mace which is bludgeon); not quite as nice as two-bladed sword's crit range (likewise slashing, with same range as i.e. Bastard Sword and Greatsword), but double-axe enjoys a x3 crit multiplier!! Good choice, too, and thanks for sharing (always good to hear, and why we do what it is that we do!   ).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

He's playing wizard, and i decided to go with the Dragonborn striker build with a few changes.<br/>\nMade an half-elf, decided to go and dual wield bastard swords.

Level 10 at the moment.<br/>\nSo here come the questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs blind fight really that important in this build or i can just skip it?<br/>\nAlso i have the same question about the Toughness feat..I do understand it helps survival, but it seems a minor improve in hp, and not very much worth a feat given that i see the dragonborn striker as a pretty agressive playstyle character.<br/>\n<br/>\nWas thinking going into DevCrit with the bastard swords-i am aware Kukris are better , just picked bastards because i usually play a rogue with kukris so ...i'm bored of it.

Just kidding, of course, but it's sadly true. I have been a SP campaign player myself and have now migrated to online play. It's almost like it's two different games. Dual-wielding Bastard Swords, you incur a -4 penalty on each attack because they are large weapons, but the effect of the penalty never materializes, as the monsters there all have such a pitiful AC that even a Wizard can hit constantly.<br/>\n<br/>\nCasters there don't dispel you, monsters don't hit you, maybe they occasionally cast a spell that will do very little damage to you, but that's about it. If those campaigns are what you're playing, then you don't need to worry to much, just about anything you do will work fine <br/>\n<br/>\nBlind Fight is an excellent feat in places where enemies actually cast Improved Invisibility for concealment, or where you get hit with Blindness from a Word of Faith or Great Thunderclap, but since in those campaigns nothing of that sort really happens, I'd say it's droppable.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The main hand weapon just has to be small enough that you can use it with one hand to allow the off-hand slot a weapon (double weapons are an exception to this rule). The penalty for dual-wield is -6 to main hand attacks, -10 to off hand attacks, but feats and the off-hand weapon choice can make up for this providing the following bonuses:<br/>\n<br/>\nAmbidexterity: +4 to off-hand attacks<br/>\nTwo weapon fighting: +2 to main hand attacks, +2 to off-hand attacks<br/>\nDual wield: Same as ambidexterity and two weapon fighting (so long as you have light armor or less), does not stack with either ambidexterity or two-weapon fighting.<br/>\nLight off-hand: +2 to main hand attacks, +2 to off-hand attacks, if the off-hand weapon is at least one size less than your creature size or you are using a two sided weapon<br/>\nImproved two weapon fighting: one extra  attack in the off-hand progression<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Against another DevCrit build, you'd want your Fort saves as high as possible to avoid their Dev crits at least enough to beat a typical 43 DC.  Just make sure not to count saves vs. spells.  So if the +4 from EF doesn't get you real near the 43 level, I'd go the +2 AC route.  Against non-DevCrit builds, EF won't be worth doodly squat. \n<blockquote><div><strong>campgod wrote:</strong><br/>\nI know Blind fight is nice too in the long run but KD is also nice.  </div></blockquote>\nIMO Blight Fight is worth more than plain Knockdown because the benefit vs. concealment and invisibles is guaranteed by the feat while a successful KD is subject to not only a dice roll auto-miss but significant reduction in AB while attempting it, further reducing your number of successful hits compared to a standard attack. IKD would help reduce the attack disparity some but it would require juggling of abilities to meet the prereq.  You should be relying on crits against all enemies (unless you plan on dueling a shifter/druid construct, elemental or undead shape), rather than diddling with KD (This IS for PvP, right?).\n<blockquote><div><strong>campgod wrote:</strong><br/>\nI would like to PvP with this once at lvl 40.

I adjusted starting dex to 10 and constitution to 12. Imho, +1AC is better than +1HP/level. This build already has a decent number of overall hitpoints so losing 1 per level is acceptable imo. Now why dex 10? The numbers line up much better in every case:<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>In early levels, chainmail/breastplate AC can be maxed with (self-cast) Cat's Grace (total AC bonus = +7, assuming a Cat's Grace roll of 4 or 5). Of course, we would like to dual-wield from level 1, but with this starting dex score, any challenging environment will demand chainmail + tower shield.</li>\n<li>In mid levels (assuming +4 dex gear or better), you can get the same AC with studded leather and self-cast Cat's Grace (total AC bonus = +7, assuming a Cat's Grace roll of 4 or 5). Once you transition to light armor, you can freely switch between dual-wielding and weapon-and-shield.</li>\n<li>Now, in higher levels, when UMD gear, ioun stones and other goodies come into play, it's feasible to have dex capped at 22, giving +6 dex AC. That will allow for +8 total AC with leather armor. Ranger-specific armor is almost always leather, studded leather or hide. If you want to wear a nice suit of leather armor, you'll want to be able to maximize your dex AC.</li>\n<li>If you start with 8 dex, you'll always fall a bit short. In early levels, you'll be able to get up to 13 dex via Cat's Grace for only +6 total AC when wearing chainmail/breastplate. In higher levels, if you manage to fully buff your dex to 20, it will be awkward because both studded leather and regular leather will only give +7 total AC. Remember that you might want to wear a nice suit of enchanted leather armor (perhaps one that bestows Haste for example) but you'll never be able to maximize your AC because of the NWN +12 cap. I guess it won't matter if you're going to wear studded leather anyway, but I would like to have the option to \"upgrade\" if I'm able to cap my dex.</li>\n<li>Finally, dex doesn't only affect armor - every time you use a missile weapon, you get +1 AB thanks to the higher starting dex score.</li>\n</ul>\n2. I adjusted epic feats to get +2 strength at the cost of two favored enemy types. +2 strength means +1 Dev Crit DC vs. non-crit-immunes and +1 AB +1 damage vs. all enemies. The cost is fewer enemy types that can be threatened by Bane of Enemies and the bonus damage to favored enemies (+7 damage at ranger level 25). However, remember that this is a Dev Crit build so any enemy that's vulnerable to critical hits can potentially die every time you attack it (assuming your AB is high enough, which is another reason AB should be buffed). Moreover, the two final favored enemies in the build are taken at levels 38 &amp; 40 so it's really an environment-based decision at that point. If you really need an extra favored enemy type for the module or persistent world you're in, then you can cut epic prowess to add one or if you really need all seven, then you can use Tyr Templar's feat plan. I realize that if you're building for PvP, you'll probably want to have all the player races as favored enemies so you might need all seven in that case (human, elf, dwarf, gnome, halfling, half-orc, half-elf). However, my build is for PvM.<br/>\n3. Tiny note about Animal Empathy: it's my personal preference to have that skill available to use. In many modules, rangers and druids get special dialogue options, etc, just by having even one point invested. It's one of those skills that you can only use if you are trained in it so that one point can really go a long way. Many modules have animals running around that can be used as companions before you have any summon creature spells or your animal companion. Moreover, as experienced players will be well aware, the skill can be easily \"buffed\" via equipment or potions to beat skill checks if needed. A lot of ranger-specific gear includes bonuses to this skill but you still can't use it if you don't invest at least one point. Of course, for anyone who is not interested in using the skill, they may adjust skills so they end up with one more point in Listen at level 40.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I do realize that the dex bonus can never be \"locked down.\" In an environment with lots of sneakers, it's going to mean nothing and this build will need to wear chainmail and use a shield if it can't detect the enemies well enough. To that end, Listen is maxed at every level and of course favored enemies are easier to detect. Meanwhile, Invisibility Purge should help as well vs. anything invisible, if I understand how the spell is supposed to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, I'm currently playing in an environment with a trivial difficulty level (SoU), mostly because I couldn't figure out which module/PW to try out next, so I doubt any of these factors will matter so much for me. I wouldn't mind trying the challenge of playing this in a harder environment but I would need one to be recommended since I couldn't manage to pick an appropriate one myself. I want to play from 1-40 or at least somewhere past level 35, and I don't want to play Swordflight or Aielund. I already have a couple Swordflight playthroughs in progress and I don't like the Aielund module.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, I'm currently wearing chainmail and using a shield when needed, but I'm also at a very low level (level 4) and don't have access to Cat's Grace yet or any +dex gear (there is a bracers of dex +1 in one of the stores but it won't do me any good). Anyway, I can't \"lose\" my +0 to AC from 10 dex, but I would always have the penalty of -1AC if I had 8 dex.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, this build is supposed to excel against crit-immunes - I added all the crit-immune enemies to my list of favored enemies so they should get blown away by the time I get Bane of Enemies, and they shouldn't be too tough even before then.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe AC starts out poor but will improve in epic levels once Tumble AC and Red Dragon Disciple bonus AC (+4) come into play. In a previous version that didn't include Devastating Critical, I actually left Dex at 8 and added the Heavy Armor Proficiency. However, that's not really an ideal solution to the problem since rangers obviously can't wear heavy armor when dual-wielding.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess, most importantly, I would like to know how you would improve the build or how you would build a strength-based ranger dual-wielder. I guess you could add some levels of barb, rogue or shadowdancer to get uncanny dodge, or maybe the best route is dwarven defender for both defensive awareness and damage reduction.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

OK, I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeally, there should be a list of the \"best\" ranger builds out there, including the best strength-based dual-wielding ranger build. Then that build should have a rating. If dual-wielding strength-based ranger builds are all garbage (by whatever standards builds are evaluated), then maybe the best of them will only have a 2 out of 10 rating. I don't know. But it sure would be nice to have some kind of reference to know which builds are good and which aren't.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I wore full plate and carried a tower shield when needed. Aielund Saga has Dev Crit disabled so it was a build without it; naturally, that gave space for the heavy armor proficiency feat whereas the Dev Crit version has less freedom to add feats.

They demonstrate what is <em>POSSIBLE. </em>Good builders are demonstrating what is possible.\u00a0 Not all are like this, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers are good, solid builds that are playable from level 1 to 40.\u00a0 And still others mature at late levels (sometimes at level 40).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a good, solid build one should really first get acquainted with the ins-and-outs of NWN.\u00a0 What exactly is a good AB to have?\u00a0 How about AC?\u00a0 What sort of damage should be dealt out? And so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, you may be asking (or thinking) \"how come this info is not already posted, or certain builds exclaimed as \"the best\"?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the answer to that is actually pretty simple : because it depends on the environment where one plays in.\u00a0 Magic level, opponents AB, AC, DR, Regen, Abilities, etc.\u00a0 Items that are available, Feats that are nerfed, or changed and a whole lot of other factors that need to be weighted and considered.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why you see a lot of \"naked\" references to both AC and AB in most builds posted here. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother factor to consider when discussing environment is the AI (or real people in the case of PvP).\u00a0 Bioware AI is generally \"dumb\" - it doesn't make good use of most abilities, etc.\u00a0 There are custom AIs that have been created by the Community to compensate for this (and of course Bioware AI can be modified and made better by using may of the inactive parts).\u00a0 Another factor is how the encounters are designed, numbers, what is normal for a \"m0b\", a sub-boss, and a boss encounter, and of course spells and abilities that are allowed and used.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if you are planning on only using builds for the OCs, and most Mods in SP, things will most likely be easy going.\u00a0 Aieland Saga and Swordflight are supposed to be harder, I have heard (I personally have not played them - I spend most of my time these days on PWs).\u00a0 I rather suspect that your chosen build in this thread will do very well in SoU.\u00a0 SoU is very easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will give you an example of some things on WoG that one encounters - let us take a Drow Warrior for example.\u00a0 It uses a Katana (magical), has Plate Mail +5, a Tower Shield + 5, and good, solid AC, +49 AB (Weapon Master levels), likes to use Ki Strikes for max damage, and likes to crit ALOT (I've seen crits do up to 100+ damage per hit).\u00a0 These things are put together with some Rogue Crossbow users who sneak attack and some Sorcerer Mages that like to throw around epic spells, etc.\u00a0 One can run into these gents at relatively low epic levels.\u00a0 They of course also have the famous Drow Magic Resistence (as well as having DR vs slashing and piercing).<br/>\n<br/>\nOr we can consider our friend, Goristo.\u00a0 He's a demon, and he is really, really nasty.\u00a0 Likes to sneak about, and can really put the hurt on anyone!\u00a0 A high AB of +45, does a brickload of damage per hit, has high DR, and high AC, and is generally just a nasty customer.\u00a0 One can run into these under epic level (aroundabout).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, the thing about these critters is that they all have massive amounts of hit points, and very high Fort saves.\u00a0 This means that most Dev Crits are going to be \"fishing\" for 1s (meaning trying to get them to roll a 1 for a save, which auto-fails).\u00a0 To that is the high AC, meaning that it could be that it is impossible to Dev Crit them because one cannot confirm the Crit roll vs that AC (meaning one needs a natural 20 to hit).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this is where AB and AC come into the picture (we'll leave DR and Regen out here).\u00a0 To start getting relatively good numbers for the Dev Crit DC, one needs a high Str here (The difficulty class of the save is 10 + \u00bd character level + strength modifier).\u00a0 So we are looking at 10+20 (max level modifier)+Str modifier as the DC.\u00a0 And the above fiends have Forts that approach or exceed 50.\u00a0 So one can start to see that things are not just \"cut and dried\" because one has AB X or AC Y or Ability Z.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for our example (Dev Crit), we need to threaten it.\u00a0 That means we need to hit, first.\u00a0 If the AC is high enough (and our AB is not), then there will never be a Dev Crit threatened, because we need a natural 20 just to hit!\u00a0 That means that the Crit itself (that threatens a Dev Crit save) will never be confirmed, because the natural 20 rule does not apply to crit confirming.\u00a0 So even though in your example one has a Kukri (which has a really good crit range) and let us say is Keen (which increases the Crit Range) and of course the build has Improved Critical (to improve the range even further), it will not matter if the roll needed to hit is far above the crit range!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis also applies to your opponent(s) - because they have the same \"rules\" and must obey them, for the most part.\u00a0 And this is why I mentioned that your build has low AC.\u00a0 This does not mean that in the environment where you are planning on using it (if I understand correctly it is going to be SoU) that this is true.\u00a0 But in the environment where I play, it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it is exactly for these reasons that we do not have a \"best builds\" catagory - because the environment has huge deciding factors that determine this.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat can be said is \"this AB is good\" when compared naked, or \"this AC is good\" when compared naked, and vice versa.\u00a0 So it is important to learn where exactly the limits are, naked, for these values.\u00a0 And by that, I mean not the maximum (because most \"max\" builds suffer from weaknesses caused by maxing one of these values).\u00a0 So any build that can sport an AB of 50+ (naked), and a high AC (naked), is going to be something to contend with, most of the time (there are even exceptions to this, as there could be excessive DR, etc that one needs to consider).<br/>\n<br/>\nAC is even more complicated, because there are ways to \"lose\" massive amounts of it and it is situational. Trying to \"shore\" AC up is one of the major concerns and puzzle pieces one has when creating a build.\u00a0 And there are many ways to do this (just as there are many ways to screw it up!)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo let us talk about a certain build for a moment.\u00a0 This is one that will often come up I believe, because it is a pretty good build imo - and it is Bard/BG/RDD.\u00a0 It is, simply put, a monster.\u00a0 With the Bard Song, Curse Song, Taunt, and Divine Shield (as well as Divine Might) abilities, it totally wrecks stuff.\u00a0 Built properly in an environment, it will inevitably do well. It really only \"suffers\" (if that can even be said) from lack of safety from spells (though the saves are exceptionable).\u00a0 With UMD and access to Spell Mantles, etc, it is pretty much covered, even there.\u00a0 It is one of those \"this build covers all the angles\" sort of build.\u00a0 It is not invincible, mind you, but comes pretty close.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I hope I have answered your questions satisfactorily.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\"><em class=\"mention\">@webshaman1</em>\u00a0Thanks so much for your detailed responses. I do appreciate them. I'm trying to learn and understand more. To that end, I'm playing this build that I posted (basically Tyr Templar's build with minor tweaks) in World of Greyhawk. I'm on the Ruski (sp?) island and up to level 11. To be honest with you, up until this point hasn't been terribly hard. Yes, I have had to respawn several times. Yes, I have lost the items I gave to my animal companion twice. And yes, I met\u00a0\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>a great white shark\n</details>\n\nthat wrecked me. I have a treasure map but no treasure (I can't find it lol - perhaps my Search skill is too low?) I don't really expect this build to be uber powerful. It's more of a fun build, I guess. At first, I wore Chainmail and used the equivalent of a large shield. Later, I transitioned to magical Scale Mail. I saved up until I could afford a really good tower shield. Little by little, I beat stronger enemies and collected their gear, improving mine in the process. Finally, I have Hide Armor +2, Amulet of Protection +3, Ring of Protection +2 and gear that gives me dex+3. With a lucky roll on Cat's Grace, I got my dex up to 18, which of course is the max that matters when wearing Hide Armor. At this point, I usually dual-wield against the more trivial enemies (to kill them quickly and give them less time to threaten me. As you know, with 5 attacks a round, you get the first two immediately at the start of a round - that ends most of the weaker enemies.) When I notice that an enemy can hit hard or when my hit points suddenly drop, I quickly equip my shield.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, all that aside, I'm interested to hear how you do with GD's Brood of the Mountains build. More importantly, how is that build better than this one, if it is? Does his build achieve a higher AC? I thought we didn't care about dex AC since it can't be locked down? I'm a bit confused honestly. I can see the attraction of using a two-handed weapon since you can only ever get two attacks with the second weapon so if you're hasted, you're getting five attacks with a two-handed weapon, with 1.5xStr damage on each of those five hits, whereas a dual-wielder is getting 1xStr damage on five attacks and 0.5xStr damage on two attacks. GD's build's ability score setup is quite reasonable. I saw Tyr's version and convinced myself that I needed to get 18 strength from the beginning. Tyr's build gets a higher final AB and the AC difference is only from dex, isn't it? I thought the dex AC was inconcequential since we can't lock it down. So how does Tyr's build have too low of an AC but GD's doesn't?<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease don't take any of this the wrong way. I wish to learn and understand more and I feel confused because, if anything, I like Tyr's build more honestly, though both builds are about the same imo. If you would be so kind as to explain, I would like to know why you decided to follow GD's build and not Tyr's, for example. In my case, I did look at all the builds with Ranger26+/Bard1+/RDD10 and liked Tyr's the most so I based my build off of hers.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease forgive me if I'm somehow being rude because that's not my intention at all.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You also recommended Nether Scrolls, if I'm not mistaken, as a bridge between SoU and HotU.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to play this build in SoU (and indeed, I have gotten up to level 4 or so) but then Webshaman told me the AC was too low based on WoG standards so I had to try it in WoG instead to see if it's really as bad as he says. I may or may not go back to the SoU playthrough but it feels as though people on this site don't really take the official campaigns seriously so anything I accomplish there has little meaning to them. So I'm trying it in WoG instead. If I can do well in WoG with it, then I will have proven myself and my words will mean something if I say I think the build is good, for example.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

My experience so far playing on WoG (I realize it's extremely limited and at low levels), my theoretical knowledge, and all the information you presented so far doesn't counter any of the points I made in previous posts in this thread. I'm not saying that my points were all right. I'm saying that you haven't yet provided evidence as to why they were wrong. You just said that I would realize I was wrong if I played on WoG. I'm playing on WoG to figure out what you mean but as far as I know, you still haven't specifically said what I did wrong, unless you mean the weapon focus in kukri instead of a two-handed weapon. However, the two-handed weapon option has lower AC so that seems to counter your main concern, which was that the build's AC was too low.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><div><cite>webshaman1 wrote: <a data-post-id=\"24827\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/viewtopic.php?p=24827&amp;sid=7fc88c16c97d27bce99d7afc4d55a1df#p24827\">\u2191</a><div class=\"responsive-hide\">Jul 04, 2021</div></cite>Well, since GD's build is a Str based build, I am going two-handed weapon.\u00a0 I will probably go Falcion (as I have not tried that yet on WoG).\u00a0 Although using a mercurial Greatsword is mighty fine (I already have one character that does and it rocks!).

That is very impressive indeed. At level 11, I believe I get up to 29 AC with a roll of 5 on Cat's Grace. But then again, I only have a Hide Armor +2. I could get up to 31AC with an upgrade to Ring of Protection +3 and Studded Leather +3 which are available in stores. Of course, you have the meta knowledge to find better gear obviously. I have no idea how to get /15 DR physical but I assume we're talking crafting gems and sockets. I already \"wasted\" an Unstoppable gem since there is no documentation for much of anything and I can only learn via trial and error *sigh*.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, I now have some good things to look for: items to increase physical DR, Regen &amp; constitution. So I'm grateful that you shared your strategy regarding those things.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>The reason I choose GD's build over the one you are using is because it plays to it's strengths (no pun intended).\u00a0 It is a Str based build and makes no mistakes about that.\u00a0 Remember, until Dev Crit, one is \"stuck\" dealing out the damage of the weapon in question.\u00a0 Kukris do not do a lot of damage, and even on crit only do 1d4x2.\u00a0 That is very little, even with the str bonus added in (which will only be 1x due to one handed use).\u00a0 But the main reason for avoiding Kukri is because it is extremely difficult to get a good Kukri on WoG (let alone two!). </div></blockquote>\n\nHere is another environmental factor I was not aware of, though it seems to be a recurring theme. I had the same problem in Aielund. Good kukris were really hard to find and one of them was alignment-restricted so I couldn't use it if I enchanted it too much. Usually, with weapons like kukris, you want to find nice enchantments (magical or elemental damage) that can be applied to critical hits. I currently have a kukri+2 that I'm using as my main weapon and the frequent crits are pretty nice, though admitedly the damage isn't all that impressive. I have 22Str with gear so I get +6 damage to each hit but of course that could be +9 if I were using a two-handed weapon. The problem with two-handed weapons is that you can't use them with a shield. The nice thing about kukris is that they can be used with a shield or dual wielded. Anyway, you already know all of that.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>Let me give you an example of what I mean.\u00a0 Say you are up against an opponent that has +6(or unlimited)/X DR.\u00a0 You only have a +5 Kukri (or two).\u00a0 So you cannot penetrate the DR here.\u00a0 That means even with a crit, you have to overcome the DR to do any damage.\u00a0 Depending on the DR of the opponent in question (and this could be a spell, btw), it may mean not doing any damage at all!\u00a0 So one will be having to add in some elemental damage here (and hope that the enemy in question does not have protection against it).\u00a0 And until BoE (which can help mitigate this problem somewhat), such a foe can really put a damper on things. </div></blockquote>\n\nSo this is again a huge environmental concern. It reminds me of when I went up against an \n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary> ancient white dragon in Aielund that had all sorts of damage resistance. The build I was using was dex-based so its damage output was pitiful and the enemy had resistances for almost all my damage so I was dealing really small amounts of damage with each hit - something like 2-10, I don't remember exactly. Thankfully, it didn't have regen I could hack away at it and run if I needed, then come back and finish it off. My AC was really high so I rarely got hit, making it a bearable fight.\n</details>\nI think the simple answer to the problem you're presenting here is that I could easily equip a two-handed weapon for enemies with high DR. There is no weapon specialization involved here so the only difference is -3AB due to the weapon focus feats and the loss of critical range. In my build, the weapon focus feats all come late. Of course, -3AB is a huge difference but in a persistent world, if something is too strong, I can always resort to traps or coming back later or I don't know - there should be other solutions. It's not like a single-player module where you have to kill something to advance the plot and there are no other areas to go to farm items or xp, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still like specializing in a one-handed weapon since it's more versatile. The biggest concern in my mind is the flexibility to switch between shield and no shield and having a weapon that can be utilized when dual-wielding or with a shield. Even in the example you gave, if the enemy with high DR also has high AB, we'll want to wear a shield, right? Then you won't be able to use your two-hander.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><div>You will also eventually run into a Disarmer, most likely.\u00a0 And since the Kukri is a tiny weapon, it is very easy to Disarm (except for some Cursed ones, that is!).\u00a0 As I already have a character that uses Kukris, I am very aware of the downs and ups of using them as I have had to deal with both of these hurdles.\u00a0 Please note that my Kukri user is a Dex based melee character (and another one of GD's creations).</div></blockquote>\nYep, this is another instance where I would switch to a large weapon. Actually, if anything I would want to switch to a double weapon. I realize it's worse against high DR enemies but I really love the double weapons. If the enemy's DR isn't too high, I would probably use a double weapon against disarmers. With high strength, it won't be hard to carry around all sorts of weapons for different situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nWebShaman, thanks again for sharing your thoughts. Even with everything you've presented, I think there are merits for both paths. It sounds like WoG in particular may be a poor environment to use kukris as the primary weapon but I imagine I will discover that soon enough :) In the meanwhile, I'll see what I can accomplish with my build.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm still curious about how on earth I can get 40 AC (you're probably higher level than me and that would explain it or maybe you already took a bard level and/or RDD levels) or 15 physical DR but this is all OK. I'm just starting WoG for the first time and it's my first time ever in a persistent world so I obviously still have much to learn and experience. So off I go to do so!\u00a0<img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That's obvious. I'm talking about level 11 here. You haven't told me what level your toon is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand the point about \"nerfing\" kukris.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I already anticipated that there would be a \"wall\" of the nature you're describing. I assume it's to make it harder for builds like mine to succeed (melee builds that do their first Tumble dump in epic levels).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my challenge will be to see if I can survive those levels - from around level 18 to level 22. Once I hit level 22, I will gain +5AC and 25UMD so that should take care of AC problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and no one is going to sacrifice me ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's also the option of partying up with someone who can buff me, etc.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I did not. I made it to the Tumble, Spellcraft and UMD skill dump at level 22 without any major incident.
