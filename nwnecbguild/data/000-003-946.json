      "content": "<div>Where do I start...<br/>\nPaladins are a MAD class and the restricted environment that you play isn't helping but we will try to do the best we can, as always.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of trying to repair your build it is much easier to give you a proposal and then you can tell us if it is to your liking. But first, let me answer some of your questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Yes, it is worth it but you don't have the feats to take them.<br/>\n2. Same as above, plus we don't know if it is common for the enemies to have KD immunity or if there are items such as rogue's hood available.<br/>\n3. No, unless you have feats to spare.<br/>\n4. AS is mandatory, EWF &amp; EP even more so for any fighting character.<br/>\n5. Not much that you don't know already, MA, UV &amp; Cat's are the best, buffs mostly since you can't cast in combat any arcane spell that isn't verbal only.<br/>\n6. Rogue would also give you evasion but I don't know if it is crucial to your character. A couple dice of sneak attack is alright to have but not necessary.<br/>\n7. Exotic isn't worth it in this build, you have many more crucial feats to take and you don't have the feats for all of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a rough prototype for you,<br/>\n<br/>\nPAL 20/ BRD 4/ FTR 6 (Epic)<br/>\nPAL 12/ BRD 3/ FTR 5 (Pre-Epic)<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR:\u00a0 16 +2 (Gift)/ <strong>18</strong><br/>\nDEX:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 8<br/>\nCON: 12<br/>\nINT: \u00a0 10<br/>\nWIS:\u00a0 12 +2 (Pal)/ <strong>14</strong><br/>\nCHA: 16 +2 (Gift) +8 (Levels + Feat)/ <strong>26</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nPre-Epic Feats: Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Blind Fighting, Power Attack, Divine Shield, Divine Might, Extend Spell, Extra Turning, Craft Wands.<br/>\nEpic Feats: Epic Weapon Focus, Epic Weapon Specialization, Epic Prowess, Armour Skin, Great Charisma I.<br/>\n<br/>\nHP's: 324<br/>\nAB: 32/ 27/ 22/ 17<br/>\nDMG: 1d8 +10/ 17-20 x2<br/>\nSkills: Discipline: 33 (37), Tumble: 30, Taunt: 33 (41), Perform: 1 (9), Heal: 16 (18)</div>"

I make my characters with race and class in mind before anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo I want to be a paladin? Yes.<br/>\nDo I want to be human? Yes.<br/>\nTo me I don't feel like a Paladin when a character (made up example) is say 29 Bard/1 Paladin I feel like a Bard who is a wannabe paladin. Hence the desire for the paladin spell-slots.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen from there create a character around that. I dislike when it is suggested I choose a different race for min/maxing. (Not that anyone suggested that but you get the point.) I want to be a human paladin but be the best I can with the hand I've been dealt.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bastard sword however was less important to me and just wishful fantasy. I can live with the long-sword.<br/>\n<br/>\nI took note of the feats you mentioned and am currently building the character you suggested for trial.

And yes my AB is now a +10 instead of 6!<br/>\nThis also appears to be something my Champion of Torm build misses out on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere does however appear to still be a pre-epic extra feat.<br/>\n<br/>\nOptions I find notable include Knockdown, Cleave, Exotic weaponry, Toughness, Empower spell, Various Saves and energy resistance. Or if I stat into 13/14 int I could take Expertise, leave out wand crafting and take Improved I/E for maximum AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do however like the idea of this build. It presents a more martial feel to the paladin while not being associated with only one deity. And allowing more spell slots for me to use.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy last question would be in regards to skill points, I am not fully aware of how useful these are in game or Arelith terms. I was under the Impression UMD was very worthwhile if it could be taken. And concentration I suppose is not worth it?</div>"

      "content": "<div>You edited your post but it's alright, I will answer to what I haven't yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou assume that expertise is going to make you a true defender of the realms and it is somewhat true, this is a good feat for \"normal\" warriors. In your case though, you already have a holy warrior with plate &amp; shield and full tumble and UMD, that alone puts you on par with a good defensive warrior. Let them make use of expertise and lose 5AB in order to gain 5AC, that is NOT your way. Your Paladin with his awesome charisma can raise his AC upwards to 14! points without losing ANYTHING from his AB just by making use of the Divine shield. Now THAT is the Paladin's way! You are not going to use it all the time but you are sure to use it when it matters. You have 17 (23) turn undead uses to fuel those Divine Feats, make good use of them and nothing will be able to hurt you. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to recap, expertise is a nice feat to have but nowhere near that important for you. More skills are always nice to have but you already have the most important ones, including \"taunt\", so I see little value to lower your AB in order to have more of them. And increased saves in a build with Paladin and a buffed 38 charisma...Let's just say that you simply don't need them. You can sacrifice \"craft wands\" in order to get your bastard sword and then you will have all that you wanted initially and more. Do not drop \"extend spell\" you need this for Divine Favour which is an awesome buff and one that you will use all the time, it's that good.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun,</div>"
