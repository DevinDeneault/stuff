      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hail, Mighty ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea behind this character was to make an Assassin that specialized in assassinating Assassins. He studied their techniques for years and is now able to execute them with perfection, but instead of selling his services as a killer-for-hire like all of them, he decided it would be more profitable to sell his services to those who had a prize on their heads and build a reputation that instilled fear on all Assassins. Once the first Assassin sent to do the job fell, it would discourage future Assassination attempts from taking place, after word got out that the mark was under the protection of the Assassin Hunter. It worked like a charm, and soon he was charging obscene amounts of gold to protect prominent people who were marked for death from the first attempt, and a moderate upkeep fee to announce they're under his protection. To this day, no Assassins have succeeded on attempts against people protected by this mysterious man.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I thought to myself, what would be a counter-assassin? The first thing I remembered was my Underdark Expeditioner, where I used Dwarven Defender just to become immune to Sneak Attacks in a build that had lots of d6 of Sneak Attacks itself. Combining this with Assassin, you now have a brutal murderer who will not end his enemy's life swiftly. He will wait for the ambush to occur, and spring his brutal trap. He will most likely paralyze them on the first strike, but even if that doesn't work, he won't use traps or any other shenanigans, he will simply use his affinity with Darkness to sneak the crap out of Assassins, while they watch in horror as they hit him with their best weapons and moves, and he comes out of it nearly unscathed.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has 26 levels of Assassin, making his Death Attack DC really high at 38, especially factoring in INT-enhancing items and buffs, where it can go up to 44 with Capped INT. He has 13d6 Death Attack damage, and he doesn't really want to be subtle, so he comes at his enemies with a Dwarven Waraxe and a high(ish) STR score to mutilate his enemies and send a message against future attempts.<br/>\n<br/>\nLadies and Gentlemen, The Assassin Hunter!<br/>\n<br/>\nFighter(8), Dwarven Defender(6), Assassin(26), Dwarf<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 17 (30)<br/>\nDEX: 13 (14)<br/>\nCON:

Silently(1), Open Lock(4),\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: As Kfor85 suggested, in places where immunity to KD is common, Discipline becomes droppable, and can be replaced with Spot or Listen to detect hidden creatures. This also means you can take Fighter 8 much earlier in the build (at level 25, just after EWF, for earlier EWS), since you won't need the late skill dump. Then, that last Epic Skill Focus should be taken in whatever detection skill you choose.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT 2: Another way to do it without changing anything else would be to drop CON to 12, and increase INT to 16. Now you have 43 extra Skill points, which can be invested into a detection skill. This also has the good side effect of raising your DA DC by 1. (but you lose 80 HP!)<br/>\n<br/>\nTweaked version with detection skill:<br/>\n<br/>\nFighter(8), Dwarven Defender(6), Assassin(26), Dwarf<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 17 (30)<br/>\nDEX: 13 (14)<br/>\nCON:

Brain fart LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, not being a DEX build, it makes sense to invest in Discipline to avoid being knocked prone with every attack, something that Assassins normally try to do (his AC as a STR character isn't exactly top notch), but in worlds with immunity to KD, then Discipline is certainly droppable for a detection skill. Thanks for pointing that out. It actually makes sense to do that. I'll edit the OP with that alternative.

In Vanilla NWN, where True Seeing lets you see everything, whether hidden or invisible, it doesn't matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for places with modified True Seeing adding to Spot instead, I already changed the second version of the build to get ESF: Spot instead of Discipline, which alongside True Seeing adding to it, should allow you to detect pretty much anything. Thanks for the input. I actually think this second version is better, thematically at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

But if such items weren't available, dropping Discipline wouldn't be an option IMO. In that case, you could either go with the second version of the build or drop Stealth skills, and use Invisibility wands instead as your source of sneaking. There are certainly many options for ways you can tweak this build, all of which are environment-dependant. That floor of said Wizard's Tower is a problem without detection, but less so if one is immune to Sneak Attacks, as most of their damage output comes from them.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
