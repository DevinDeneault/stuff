You think it's strange that people haven't posted builds using HS? It's the red-headed stepchild of prestige classes!!<br/>\n<br/>\n</em>- Kaliban99, to Kail Pendragon, in <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build219263.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Field Scout</em></a>\u00a0Sunday, 06 November 2005</div></blockquote>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Introduction:</strong><br/>\nGreetings all!<br/>\nThis is my attempt at the most useful Harper Scout I could conceive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe features are:<br/>\n- Rogue for 12d6 sneak attack, evasion/improved evasion, uncanny dodge, crippling strike, epic dodge, great skills<br/>\n- Fighter to help with combat feats pre-epic and epic, weapon specialization/epic weapon specialization for non-sneak damage<br/>\n- Harper Scout to help with discipline skill dumps and two bonus feats into great dexterity<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably the only redeeming feature of Harper Scout in this build is the Great Dexterity feats, which one pays for with needing to take Iron Will / Alertness. Funnily enough, Iron Will and Alertness are useful in this build.\u00a0<br/>\nWith the extra dexterity, I try to accentuate this particular 'strength' by putting the dex score as high as possible. Dexterity rogues will not quite get a dex score that high without bonus great dexterity feats from Assassin (ie Assassin 18 can provide two bonus great dexterity feats), but then you have to be evil.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Basic stats at a glance:</strong><br/>\nBase AB 45, 43 with ITWF shortswords, Blind Fight/Improved Knockdown, Weapon Specialization/Epic Weapon Specialization, 12d6 sneak attack<br/>\nBase 368hp (508 capped), F21W17R34 +2 saves against spells<br/>\n338 skill points, max discipline, stealth, near max spot, DT 38 modified, Tumble 40, UMD 33 modified, open lock 24 modified etc<br/>\nHarper coolness, namely the Dex score of a well built assassin sneaker without having to be evil<br/>\nBase Dex 38 cap-able at 50 (hooray!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI chose elf, 20% exp penalties from lvl 18-40.\u00a0<br/>\nHalfling gets no exp penalties and has +1 AB and +1AC and +40 hp at the cost of some strength and keen senses and a worse ability to knockdown opponents.\u00a0<br/>\nBoth races seem good here but overall elf seemed the most fun.\u00a0<br/>\nDwarf and Human would have been good too, but then you don't get the 38 Dex and it didn't seem as fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway hope you enjoy. Delighted to hear comments, may take this one for a run some day soon<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Fighter(12), Rogue(23), Harper Scout(5), Elf\nSTR: 10\nCON: 12\nINT: 14\n\n01: Rogue(1): Two-Weapon Fighting\n03: Fighter(2): Ambidexterity, Weapon Focus: Shortsword\n05: Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}\n07: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Shortsword\n09: Rogue(5): Improved Knockdown\n11: Fighter(6): Improved Two-Weapon Fighting\n13: Rogue(7)\n15: Fighter(8): Iron Will, Blind Fight\n17: Rogue(9)\n19: Rogue(11)\n21: Fighter(9): Epic Weapon Focus: Shortsword\n23: Rogue(13): Improved Evasion\n25: Rogue(14)\n27: Rogue(16): Great Dexterity III, Epic Dodge, (DEX=29)\n29: Rogue(17)\n31: Rogue(19): Crippling Strike\n33: Harper Scout(2): Great Dexterity V, (DEX=33)\n35: Harper Scout(3)\n37: Rogue(22)\n39: Rogue(23): Great Dexterity VII, (DEX=36)\n\nSkillpoints: 338\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +2, Mind Effects: +4, Traps: +7\nAB (max, naked): 45 (melee), 42 (ranged)\nSpell Casting:\u00a0\n\n\n01: Disable Trap(1), Hide(4), Lore(4), Move Silently(4), Open Lock(1), Persuade(4), Search(4), Set Trap(1), Spot(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(5),\u00a0\n03: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n05: Disable Trap(3), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Persuade(1), Spot(2), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n07: Discipline(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n09: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(5), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n11: Discipline(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n13: Disable Trap(5), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n15: Discipline(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n17: Disable Trap(3), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(2), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n19: Disable Trap(2), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(2), Spot(2), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n21: Discipline(6),\u00a0\n23: Hide(3), Move Silently(3), Spot(1), Tumble(3), UMD(3),\u00a0\n25: Disable Trap(3), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(3), Tumble(1), UMD(2),\u00a0\n27: Disable Trap(2), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(2), Spot(2), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n29: Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Search(2), Spot(2), UMD(2),\u00a0\n31: Disable Trap(2), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), UMD(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n33: Discipline(1), Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n35: Discipline(2), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(2),\u00a0\n37: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(5), Save(3),\u00a0\n39: Disable Trap(2), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(2), Save(8),\u00a0</details>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Other builds Rogue 23+ Harper Scout 5+:</strong><br/>\n<blockquote><div>ECB Archives (2004-2010)<br/>\n<strong>Search Results</strong><br/>\nBuilds with 23 to 40 levels of rogue, 0 to 40 levels of any class, and 5 to 40 levels of Harper scout.

      "content": "<div>Thanks Empyre65 and Stag<br/>\nThese are good tweaks, very sharp eyes on both of you<br/>\nTo be honest the only reason I didn't put weapon focus at level one was some environments have re-leveling wands<br/>\nIf you didn't like the weapon you chose then you can relevel your character provided all the choices you made at level 1 you are happy with (also other features like feats etc)<br/>\nIn environments without these, then weapon focus at level 1 would be what I would recommend<br/>\nFighter at level 1 is a nice variant too in certain environments, reduces reliance on the ranged weapon at level 1, tumble 5 at level 2 for +1 AC etc... just the 6x4 skill points one loses is the downside, there is space for more skill points crossclassed into spellcraft for sure<br/>\nOne could min-max a bit less and take Epic Fort and Epic Will epic levels for better saves if you feel UMD (ie Death Ward/Shadow Shield, Prot v Evil/Clarity/Lesser Mind Blank/Mind Blank, Prot v Spells) won't do the job or its nerfed</div>"
