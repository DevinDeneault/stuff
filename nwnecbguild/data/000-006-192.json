I'll try to explain: If I had gone the Zen Archery way, I would've been a jackass not to take more Cleric levels, since a higher Wisdom would make those lvl 9 spells very very attractive. However, using high wisdom would make me a better caster, but a worse sniper (as AA bonus feats can't be used for Great Wisdom, I'd be left with nothing to choose from with that last one), and anyway, a PERFECT SNIPER is what I see the AA as. Inversely, while Wisdom can be used for sniping, Dex can be used for melee also with finesse. So I chose to use Cleric in this build only as a self-buffer and have an OUTSTANDING fully buffed capped DEX AB of 78 (on WoG you can GMW bows in case you're wondering why I'm claiming this) and a not so gimped fully buffed AB of 60 in melee. Fully Buffed mode is easily dispellable, true, but even if you get dispelled, your ranged AB will still hit just about anything, and when you find yourself a good bow: WOW! Damage can be a pain (not on WoG, though, as there you can Darkfire arrows and GMW bows as I said before, which will also add the Mighty property to them), but you will always have the 5 Divine Favor unresistable damage to rely on and be pretty confident to hit on all of your 5 attacks each round against all except the highest AC monsters.<br/>\n<br/>\n So basically, I built this toon thinking of WoG, and there it will be phenomenal thanks to these custom modifications, but there is nothing to say that this build can't be played on any other server. It will suffer from the lack of damage that all dex-based archers do, but less so than most, if not all of those builds thanks to the Cleric damage buffs.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, what do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><span style=\"color:#000000\">edit: per Hip 20160916 (corrections/additions of missing info, in</span></em><span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong> red</strong></span><em><span style=\"color:#000000\">)\u00a0</span></em><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">If it is indeed  \"THE PERFECT SNIPER\" (and I think that claim is fairly well-founded), it will never get hit.  Believe me.  Even if you are lazy enough to allow the enemy to get within melee range, Tumble is so high it will never miss the check (assuming nice monk/magical robes for this one, naturally). <br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore, why Trickery? <br/>\n<br/>\nShould you decide to invest a bit more significantly in Disable traps, Set traps &amp; Search to add a decent trap repertoire into the mix, I could see some value in Trickery.  Otherwise, especially since there is no arcane casting potential except via items, I would prefer some domain that would either give more DPs for that mighty bow (Strength), Creeping Doom as an excellent adjunct for archers (Plant) or even War domain for the AoV +CON/+DEX +fort/+reflex boni against artillery casters.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO, ignoring the power of spotting/recovering  high-level traps (with only 15 cleric and no significant DT-boosting items, epic traps are probably out of the equation) with Divine Trickery is intentionally gimping its most significant benefit for a non-melee toon.  With uber DEX, Set trap allocation can be quite low without compromising the viable power of traps.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I would finance the modest trap skill investment by eliminating Concentration altogether.  A sniper can't get taunted and a self-buffer should know better than trying to buff in a mob.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe few times I've taken Weapon Finesse for this archer build I have NEVER EVER used it!  Why?  Because without pre-buffing it is a relatively wimpy attack.  Perhaps, if dispelled, the archer attack is still viable but not so with melee.  Not even any WF/EWF or Imp Crit will mean it won't scale with enemy CR in later levels.  Besides that fact, if you switch in an emergency (\"panic\" would be a more accurate word here), there is no way to pre-buff the melee weapon beforehand to make it at all effective.   A loser scenario no matter how you figure it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nRemedy:  Just kite, rely on PBS, Called Shot and back out of a messy situation.  Works so much better than switching to melee. And without Blind Fight, melee will be at best problematic.   Leave that lame switch move for the monster AI.   <br/>\n<br/>\nOther than those few issues, I think I have one of these clones on one of my uber-magic server toons that couldn't survive in that world without being an exalted archer.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Sehanine Moonbow Clerics can only choose Trickery and Travel. I didn't consider much simply because they do give me some nice goodies and that's where I play, so there is no point in wondering a lot. However, those are all viable tweaks, thanks for opening the alternatives.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the meleeing, I will gladly waste 2 spells (GMW and Darkfire) on a Rapier (or any other good weapon, hell even a mace) anytime to have options. In WoG, there are places where you can't rely on sniping because there is limited room to maneuver. So I'd rather have a shield / board as a viable alternative.

It is a bummer trying to simulate that 13x3 damage from an AA bow with that melee weapon and with 1 less APR.  Besides that, the AA's range AB bonus doesn't count towards the AB cap (usually +20) like the buffs do.  So it better be one of the baddest ass rapiers around to get even close to the PBS attack potential.  TBH, I prefer not to get within PBS range with my archer, but with good tumble, keeping moving and throwing in meat shields it's still the better of the 2 scenarios.  Like I said, unless you plan on entering combat with S/S config you are going to be wasting damage rounds buffing, which is always an inefficient choice.  And I would be very disgruntled if my cherished buffs went *poof* and I was swinging in the air doing 1 damage per hit against a DR skin.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it still comes down to what is comfortable and expeditious.  You make your bed and will be forced to lie (or perhaps \"die\" is more applicable) in it.\n<blockquote><div>\nDropping Concentration is something I can see A LOT of merit in.

As you know, I always recommend build guidelines \"blind\" to item availability &amp; server customizations so you'll need to tweak it according to those contingencies yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n(That Find traps nerf is quite common and done to retain the value of investing in trap skills by all classes.  I like that mod and think it should be an automatic change for all servers.)<br/>\n<br/>\nStrong/deadly gas set DC = <strong>45</strong> - take20 - 12dex - 2synergy = <strong>11</strong> ranks needed, Set trap<br/>\n<br/>\nDisable trap is already at minimum 16 (32 xcl points) so have no clue where you are going to find those 22 xcl skill points, which is why I just shoved the spare ones into Search to help make detection FASTER, not easier.  The thing with gas traps, in general, is that IMO they are highly overrated since the fort save vs. poison is usually high on the higher CR monsters and the gas release can be skipped by any hasted creature.  So don't be swayed by the apparently impressive damage potential of them... in practice, they aren't all that great.  I recommend concentrating on recovery and placing holy traps.  No save allowed and won't hurt your toon.    Tangles are another personal fav of yurz troolie.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, you didn't respond to my question about potions &amp; scrolls on WoG vs. Trickery domain:  Do they provide Invis potions/scrolls &amp; Imp Invis scrolls?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

IMO BF is far more significant to a PBS/melee build than a single AB.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

This suggestions is very good, but I have to say that the reasoning here is similar to my Demolition Man build, only there it applied to the spell DC's also. I went for MAX AB, when I thought of this toon, this was my number 1 priority, so I gave up BF to acheive that, but for those who do not have this Wolverine-like OCD (I'm the best at what I do), I'd say go for it!<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, sorry for taking so long to reply.

It can get lonely here when the regulars are tied up with RL.  My own contract season has just kicked-off its Spring/Summer activity and that usually means lots of time away from home base for me until Fall with nothing but a piece of junk they call a laptop to manage connectivity.   <br/>\n<br/>\nMake the ECB one of those web occasions, eh?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

With the gear available on the server [which was about +6 or so] it got something silly like high 60's AC and high 70's AB with buffs going. Even though there were Freedom/Ability Decrease items available on the server, the limited amount of slots available to a Dragon Shifter + Mord Scrolls meant I was able to Called Shot the dragon into the ground.
