I recently found it and searched through everything. As the title says, I now play on Arelith, although I've played on several other PvP-centric servers. I wanted to share with you all my builds folder for the level 30 builds, since I know you get a lot of them in the requests and the like. I've posted a few on their forums, but not too many people are helpful considering the amount of disagreement I get for power-building. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, I thought this might be a good build to post, because it takes only two \"gifts\" (+1 ECL for +2 stats), and doesn't need a Role-Playing Bonus on Weapon Master in order to get a token for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was planning to have some +3 armor/shield/weapons, maybe a +2 Keen scimitar as the weapon. Eventually +STR/+DEX(Maybe CON gear, haven't decided.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDisarm is to be a pain in the ass when sneaking someone, or else I might have taken KD. Someone without weapons is easier to fight than one just knocked down for a round.<br/>\n<br/>\nFighter(7), Weapon Master(7), Rogue(16), Halfling<br/>\n<br/>\nAny alignment.
