The Original Campaign (or the \"Plague Campaign\") was only playable as intended for a short period, one year, before the first expansion, Shadows of Undrentide, was released the following June and changed the core game. <br/>\n<br/>\nJoin me as we travel back 15 years to play the OC as players did when Neverwinter Nights was first unveiled to eager gamers around the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE SIMULATION: Play the OC as it was intended to be played.<br/>\n<br/>\nListed here are the ruleset elements to play very nearly as those who opened the box to install the 3 CDs.\u00a0 The instructional booklet would have contained exactly what you see listed below (except for the comments). <br/>\n<br/>\nThough some of the scripting was also modified in later releases, a player can mimic a similar challenge level by avoiding the boosts added in subsequent modifications to the core game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese features are:<br/>\n<br/>\nCLASSES<br/>\n<br/>\nLimited to:<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbarian, bard, cleric, druid, fighter, monk, paladin, ranger, rogue, sorcerer, wizard; no prestige available until SoU released; pure or multiclass are equally valid in all releases.<br/>\n<br/>\nRACES -

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I can see where the folks playing NWN wizards in 2002 may have been challenged.\u00a0 Only the fact that I've played the OC many, many times resulted in a fairly easy play-through.\u00a0 Only 1 death was registered and that was death-by-dice on a 1 roll vs. a bodak gaze in Helm's Hold when Luke Whorm got just a little too close (seemed the guy was out of range of that cone but apparently not).<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to possess my familiar a lot more than ever before.\u00a0 Normally, I'd use the fairie dragon until Lvl 5 wiz, but no such luck in 2002. Still, the pixie did great and I \"stole\" its free ImpInvis right through the final battle to free up a slot for an extra Ice Storm or Empowered Melf arrow.\u00a0 That one level 4 slot really does help early on, believe it or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nLow AC was a factor without either Shield spell or Tumble dumps.\u00a0 Eventually, it mattered less once Shadow Shield became available.\u00a0 Empowered Cat Grace was a staple.\u00a0 Barkskin buffs persisted until level 15, right about the time Luskan was finished.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo GMW meant the pixie dagger could never pierce Stoneskin and its ilk. And no Flame Weapon nerfed its damage even further.\u00a0 Boohoo. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other nerf was not having Blind Fight for the Tenser attack which meant most of the shadow battles were via Melf arrows and MM, constantly kiting them into a field of Holy traps, usually just average ones.\u00a0 Actually, the high skels were also tough with their SR foiling most MM and Melf arrow attempts.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the biggest difference was trying to steer clear of those Corrupt Dragons without GS.\u00a0 After trying to tie them up with a summon and the pixie so I could lay down some deadlies, I gave up (Grimgnaw was worthless, feared the moment he entered their aura cuz I forgot to drop a Clarity pot on him).\u00a0 The combat icon won't stop while any of the party is fighting and the set DC is too high to set them without explosion.\u00a0 Take20 makes a world of difference. Ended up just muscling through both wyrms with a fully-buffed Tenser which was easier than I had anticipated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI ended up using Chain Lightning and Horrid Wilting alot, mostly via scrolls.\u00a0 It's really important to start collecting scrolls early because the arcane library doesn't append like in HotU.\u00a0 Each chapter has its own list, always scrolls of higher level than the preceding chapter.<br/>\n<br/>\nBless and Aid pots were also staples for the Tenser.\u00a0 The +2 AB really does make fewer misses when it matters most, especially in the last 2 chapters where creatures' AC is up there and hit a whole lot harder.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Ch4 siege golems could be killed with a combo of deadly electric/deadly holy and Delayed FB placed right about where the trap stack was.\u00a0 Their regen is very high so you can't dawdle with the damage.\u00a0 Without magic or traps, they are invulnerable but worth lots of XP.<br/>\n<br/>\nMorag was a walk in the park.\u00a0 Just keep dropping Horrid Wilting scrolls on the protectors and delay your slotted buffing because she'll just dispel it.\u00a0 Her two hands drop to traps set in the hallway extremely fast but I can never seem to be able to coax her into the trap field.\u00a0 No worries. After all the protectors are destroyed, Tenser can have its way with her.\u00a0 Even Grimgnaw couldn't reach her in time for a single punch, she died so fast. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the hardest fight was against those blasted Chosen Lizards because I always have a hard time killing that cleric while being pounded by the minions.\u00a0 If they follow into the hallway, a trap field is waiting, but the cleric always res's them the moment they die so it just wastes traps.\u00a0 They always clog the doorway making it hard to get back into the room with the cleric who NEVER EVER walks into the trap field.\u00a0 But with lots of scrolls of CL and Wilting, eventually the healer gets too close to his res targets and runs out of self-heals. <br/>\n<br/>\n<em>edit:</em>\u00a0 Almost forgot... that halberd-wielding Skrogg boss enroute to Klauth disarmed Tenser's sword just before dying.\u00a0 I was wondering why all-of-a-sudden the elf's damage dropped down to very little and it turned out he was punching the Hell Hound to death and doing a fairly good job of it.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the sword didn't go flying like my Risen Lord's scythe did when the Weapon Spirit in the Maker's realm stole it (back in HotU Land), so could not redeem it for mucho gold afterwards.\u00a0 The very first time any of my Tensers have EVER been disarmed!\u00a0\u00a0 Lack of Discipline is not to be taken lightly.<br/>\n<br/>\nGenerally, the 2002 nerfs were noticeable but far from unmanageable for me. It just seemed to take longer with all the kiting and all the preemptive attacks with a possessed pixie.\u00a0 I still soloed all the way, using Grimgnaw in Helm's Hold only and his presence against the Source Stone dragons, as meaningless as it turned out.\u00a0 I did have him kill the last chosen lizardman because he was sulking, but that's about all he contributed.\u00a0 I ended up about 4K XP short of level 19 and have no doubt that the small bit of XP sharing at the very end would have made no difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying under the 2002 limitations is a good idea for aspiring magicians because it teaches resourcefulness better than being able to reach down and essentially use cheat spells to resolve problem encounters.\u00a0 But, TBH, I would have needed to buy triple the scrolls without traps at hand.\u00a0 It really makes a difference and eliminates a lot of the tedium.\u00a0 Besides, planning a trap field is FUN!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the build with some of the final stats: <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Luke Whorm</strong><br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\n<br/>\n2002 OC: Wizard 16/ Rogue 2, Any alignment Gnome\u00a0 (I chose LG for the Ch3 trial)<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 10<br/>\nDEX: 14<br/>\nCON: 18<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 16 (20)<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n01 - Wiz(1): Toughness<br/>\n02 - Wiz(2)<br/>\n03 - Wiz(3): Extend Spell<br/>\n04 - Wiz(4): INT+1 (17)<br/>\n05 - Wiz(5): Empower Spell<br/>\n06 - Wiz(6): Dodge<br/>\n07 - Wiz(7)<br/>\n08 - Rog(1): INT+1 (18)<br/>\n09 - Wiz(8): Mobility (&lt;--- replaces Tumble)<br/>\n10 - Wiz(9)<br/>\n11 - Wiz(10): Spell Pen<br/>\n12 - Wiz(11): INT+1 (19), Grt Fort<br/>\n13 - Rog(2): {Class: Evasion}<br/>\n14 - Wiz(12)<br/>\n15 - Wiz(13): Lightning Reflex<br/>\n16 - Wiz(14): INT+1 (20)<br/>\n17 - Wiz(15): SF Evocation<br/>\n18 - Wiz(16): AD Evocation<br/>\n<br/>\nHP max: 166<br/>\nSaves F/W/R (vs spells): 11/10/12 (16/15/17)<br/>\nAdd'l saves: Mind Effects +2<br/>\nBAB: 9<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 10 (melee), 12 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 13/16<br/>\n<br/>\nSkills: 131 - Concentration 21(27), Disable Trap 14(21), Lore 20(25) [note: I use scrolls of restoration instead of heal kits most of the time], Open Lock 13(15), Search 16(21), Set Trap 11(15), Spellcraft 20(25), UMD 16(15)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Conc(3), Spcr(3), S - 14<br/>\n02: Conc(1), Spcr(1), S - 17<br/>\n03: Conc(1), Spcr(1), S - 20<br/>\n04: Conc(1), Spcr(1), S - 23<br/>\n05: Conc(1), Spcr(1), S - 26<br/>\n06: Spcr(1), S - 30<br/>\n07: Spcr(1), S - 34<br/>\n08: DTrap(11), Locks(4), Srch(9), STrap(11), UMD(11)<br/>\n09: Conc(5), Spcr(1)<br/>\n10: Conc(1), Spcr(1), S - 4<br/>\n11: Conc(1), Spcr(1), S - 8<br/>\n12: Conc(1), Spcr(1), S - 12<br/>\n13: DTrap(3), Locks(9), Srch(7), UMD(5)<br/>\n14: Conc(3), Spcr(3)<br/>\n15: Conc(1), Lore(4), Spcr(1)<br/>\n16: Conc(1), Lore(5), Spcr(1)<br/>\n17: Conc(1), Lore(5), Spcr(1)<br/>\n18: Conc(1), Lore(6)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Final Spell list</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n0 - Res x4<br/>\n1 - Ext Res, Mage Armor, Prot from Evil, MM x4<br/>\n2 - Darkness x2, Ext Grease x2, Melf arrow x3<br/>\n3 - Prot from Elements, Emp MM x5, NEB x2<br/>\n4 - Emp Endur, Emp Cat, Emp Bull, Emp Fox, Ext Haste, Emp Melf arrow x2<br/>\n5 - Ext Element shld, Emp FA x3, Emp NEB x3<br/>\n6 - Grtr SS, Ext nrg buffer, Tru seeing, Emp Icestorm x2<br/>\n7 - Shadow shld, Ext Ether Vis, Ext Globe, Ext Tenser, Delayed FB<br/>\n8 - Premonition, Ext Mantle, Ext Prot from Spells<br/>\n<br/>\nPixie - ImpInvis x3<br/>\n<strong><br/>\nStats w/gear @Lvl 18</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nNo buff: Str 10/Dex 20/Con 18/Int 32/Wis 8/Cha 8, AC 28, AB +10/+5/+10, HP 165<br/>\nFull buff: Str 17/Dex 26/Con 25/Int 32/Wis 8/Cha 8, AC 37, AB +15/+10/+15, HP 219<br/>\nTenser: Str 27/Dex 29/Con 25/Int 27/Wis 8/Cha 8, AC 35, AB +30/+25/+30/+25, HP 273<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Final Gear</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nWhite Robe - +5 armor AC, +1 saves<br/>\nStaff of Command - Immunity to mind effects<br/>\nThayvian Circlet - +2 Int, +1 saves, +1 conc<br/>\nCloak of Fort - +3 defl AC, +3 saves<br/>\nBracers of Dex +4<br/>\nBelt of Agility - +2 Dex, Freedom<br/>\nRing of Clear Thought +5 Int (x2)<br/>\nAmmy of Power - add 1 ea lvl 3, 4, 5 slot<br/>\nBoots of Speed - Haste effect<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>edit: loads of typos, as usual</em><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi there. Thanks for the analysis, breakdown and vitals of Luke Whorm, Hip (btw, appreciate the name, dude!).<br/>\n<br/>\n I'll confess I've been somewhat tardy in taking this forward, but am on my way now. As I mentioned elsewhere, I'm trying to finalize 2 or 3 builds I have loitering in the Build Requests forum. One of these is a hin Monk 21 / Rogue 13 / CoT 6 (Arvoreen's Silent Sting), who's currently going through SoU/HotU/SoF - alas, I've yet to successfully reload Aielund. Anyway, an adaptation of her seemed like it might work here, so that's what I'm doing. Delaine Misthand is a Dexer, kama-wielding Monk (11) Rogue (7). I know this is sacrilege here, but I'm tweaking her as I go on (to the extent that I'm not yet sure whether she'll be a dual-wielder or not), and am presently at level 7 (M3/R4).<br/>\n<br/>\n Interestingly, I'm very surprised she's currently <em>at</em> level 7. All I've done so far is the prison, the zoo, no-man's-land, two of Ophala's art thefts, and the top floor of Meldanen's estate (I tend to go Peninsula, Blacklake, Beggar's Nest, Docks - which might not be everyone's preferred order, but I want to get the two I don't like much out of the way first). I'm travelling solo. I did contemplate bringing Daelan along for muscle, but have avoided doing so thus far. The thing is, I would normally expect to be at around level 5 - 6 at a pinch - at this point, so I'm wondering what's going on? I'm still getting 23xp for fire beetles (or at least I was: I've only just gone up to L7), which are normally 7s by now. My only thought is that the xp earned is based on BAB, rather than level, but have no idea whether that's the case or not. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining, just puzzled.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'm about to enter Helm's Hold through the back door, and have just levelled-up to 10 (M6/R4). If things continue at this rate, it might become necessary to start building for overall level 19 or 20 when ploughing the OC!<br/>\n<br/>\n A knock-on effect from this stage of levelling is the gear I'm finding. Before leaving Neverwinter I garnered both Hideo's Kama and Peasant Dynasty - neither of which I foresaw coming up. Actually, given that this was a Dex-based D-W Kama build, it was almost annoying to also find Gloves of the Yellow Rose +5 (twice!). So they're what I'm wearing - because even with WF in Kama and a +2 and +1 weapon at my disposal, they give me a better AB atm. Things will change after I take Ambidexterity at level 12 and start D-Wielding (and even there, I also opened a chest that gifted me the Braces of Locking Grip - granting Ambi and Disc+8, but am currently resisting the allure).<br/>\n<br/>\n One thing that has come in very handy in the absence of Tumble is the acquisition of the Robes of the Old Order. Until I learned better, I used to wear these a lot, combined with speedy boots at later levels, but hadn't done so for some time. For a Monk/Rogue with stealth skills, you're very vulnerable in AC terms in Chapter 1, but that little beauty soaks 5/+1 damage - and hardly anyone is attacking you with enhanced weapons at that point, so yea!<br/>\n<br/>\n All in all, it's going far too well. It's either a really good build or fate is dropping the lead into the boxing gloves about now. I know where I'd put my money...<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Pretty lame, the greatest tresures are always behind a deadly fire or electrical trap wich have a DC one or two points above that... surely I could give him a fox pot to raise his int, but I usually just order my summon to handle that trap for me... which always ends in a swift death for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n A short story about my drunken ranger: I found the perfect item for roleplaying the always drunken state, the spirit poison in ch2. It is an alcohol, and if you drink it, it doesn't disappear as any other potion would. I suppose it's because it is flagged as plot, but a much better explanation is that it just refills itself magically. Sadly the poison disappears when you enter Luskan... that would be one of the stories of my ranger if she would be a henchman, and that spirit poison would be a quest item for her :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Edit: oops, I totally forgot Rolkid's head-hunting quest, and I already let Vaath run... I should quit drinking :S<br/>\n Edit2: okay, auto save saved me this time... the last one was upon entering coldwood, so not a big deal, only three mid-sized areas had to be replayed (coldwood, coldwood-east and the wizard dungeon). However I let Vaath run again, but this time he gave me an other dead orc's head :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">A little update about the andventures of my ranger in OC :)<br/>\n Poor Aarin, he is in love with my 6 charisma half-orc :D I only started a female character to see what is the reward of the Aarin romance. He gives you an amulet in ch2 after you listened his story, even if you are a male character. This amulet doesn't do much, it can cast a light one time a day and that's all. However if your character is a female, you can continue the story from ch2 in ch3, and after you find the second word of power he gives you an upgraded version of that amulet, wich is probably the best item in the game (no, not really). It cast cast a lvl 5 light unlimited times! Oh yes, thank you Aarin, this really saves my ass when I fight with dragons and balors and alike.<br/>\n<br/>\n Else: there are three riddles in the creator ruins, and the smoke riddle is strange. The easel near gives you a hint that the Old Ones believed in the power of certain gems and that malachite was the least of them, amethyst highly prized and emeralds the most revered, and you shoul mix the powders to give the descending order of these gems. As far as I know either emerald and malachite are green, so I started the mix with green, but nothing happened - orange was the first. It was not clear to me that they thought about orange colored emeralds... they are pictured green everywhere. Luckily, there aren't any ill effects if you mix the powders incorrectly.<br/>\n<br/>\n Aaand... the fight with the white dragon in the globe was a little easier than I expected. I was just lvl13, so I set 3 deadly fire traps for him - I miscalculated the average damage, I believed that they will kill him easily, but they just took him to badly injured. However it wasn't a big deal to shoot him dead with a bow.<br/>\n Same goes for the balor lord in the ruins, while my three companions tanked him I pinned him with mundane arrows, and he was dead a few seconds later.<br/>\n<br/>\n Okay, I'm cheating... I use the expansion spells, the GMF helps the most, but the build could stand without it, you just need to be a bit more careful with your pet in the bossfights. You should cast a stoneskin on her somehow (multiclass for umd or get a gargoyle boots or something), so she can pierce dr and that's it.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm still a bit afraid that I will not reach lvl15 until ch4... I cleared two from the three areas, only moonwood left, and I need 10-12000 xp. I hope the dragons will give me a healthy amount of xp, I'm planning to kill all three of them after I completed their quests.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I shouldn't even had to kill Gorgotha in this chapter, the loot wasn't that great, and it shifted my alignment towards evil by\u00a0five points (unlike Akulatraxas).<br/>\n<br/>\n I will post the build when I finish off Morag, but I tell you in advance, it is very far from a power build...\u00a0I took some of the feats and skill because of RP and concept reasons :) If I wanted to build a power ranger (pun intended) I'd mix it with 2-3 rogue levels, go with human instead of half-orc, and I would be much careful with skill and feat selection... but someone told somewhere that even the epic scholar could complete the OC, so we don't need any power builds here.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Seriously, all four of us were still uninjured when she surrendered.<br/>\n I also had to fight Morag twice, on first try all of my companions were killed by the blade barrier, and suddenly one of Morag's Hands (the one with the Greataxe) appeared out of nowhere, critted me, and I was dead... On second try I watched my companions, so only Tomi killed himself when the statue was destroyed but the barrier remained there for a few more seconds... I thought it will disappear instantly.<br/>\n The dragons... I instantly ran towards the left corner, and luckily only one of the dragons followed me there. After that it wasn't a big deal, the spider draw the dragons attention fo a short time, which was just enough to set some traps. This way I could preapare for the second dragon in peace.<br/>\n<br/>\n To summarize things: the meatshield tactics works pretty well in OC, you send your companions into the heat of the battle, so you can knock your arrows in peace. It happens pretty often in harder battles that everyone but you dies, but usually you have to deal with only one or two badly injured foes there. However I'm pretty sure that in harder modules I should be more careful, but this is OC, and I never played anything else, so...<br/>\n<br/>\n So here's the build, Gragor Kiburd, the hero of Neverwinter (bingo, the name was generated automatically by the game ;) )<br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\n<br/>\n Ranger(16), Half-Orc<br/>\n Alignment: any (started as true neutral, ended as neutral good - benefactor)<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 16<br/>\n DEX: 14 (18)<br/>\n CON: 10<br/>\n WIS: 14<br/>\n INT: 14<br/>\n CHA: 6<br/>\n<br/>\n Half-Orc: (Darkvision)<br/>\n 01: Ranger(1): Weapon Proficiency Exotic, Favored Enemy: Undeads, {Dual Wield}<br/>\n 02: Ranger(2)<br/>\n 03: Ranger(3): Point Blank Shot<br/>\n 04: Ranger(4): DEX+1, (DEX=15)<br/>\n 05: Ranger(5): Favored Enemy: Constructs<br/>\n 06: Ranger(6): Rapid Shot<br/>\n 07: Ranger(7)<br/>\n 08: Ranger(8): DEX+1, (DEX=16)<br/>\n 09: Ranger(9): Called Shot, {Improved Two-Weapon Fighting}<br/>\n 10: Ranger(10): Favored Enemy: Reptilian Humanoids<br/>\n 11: Ranger(11)<br/>\n 12: Ranger(12): DEX+1, Skill Focus: Taunt, (DEX=17)<br/>\n 13: Ranger(13)<br/>\n 14: Ranger(14)<br/>\n 15: Ranger(15): Improved Critical: Longbow, Favored Enemy: Dragons<br/>\n 16: Ranger(16): DEX+1, (DEX=18)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 127 (max 160)<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 10/7/9<br/>\n<br/>\n BAB: 16<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 19 (melee), 20 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 14/21<br/>\n Spell Casting: Ranger(4)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Skills:<br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\n<br/>\n Skillpoints: 114<br/>\n Animal Empathy 19(17), Disable Trap 1cc(5), Heal 10(12), Hide 9(16), Listen 9(11), Move Silently 19(26), Set Trap 19(26), Spot 9(11), Taunt 9cc(10)<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Animal Empathy(4), Disable Trap(1), Heal(4), Listen(1), Move Silently(4), Set Trap(4), Spot(1), Taunt(2),\u00a0<br/>\n 02: Animal Empathy(1), Heal(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(1), Spot(1),\u00a0<br/>\n 03: Animal Empathy(1), Heal(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(1), Taunt(1),\u00a0<br/>\n 04: Animal Empathy(1), Heal(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(1), Spot(1),\u00a0<br/>\n 05: Animal Empathy(1), Heal(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(1), Taunt(1),\u00a0<br/>\n 06: Animal Empathy(1), Heal(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(1), Spot(1),\u00a0<br/>\n 07: Animal Empathy(1), Heal(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(1), Taunt(1),\u00a0<br/>\n 08: Animal Empathy(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(1), Spot(1),\u00a0<br/>\n 09: Animal Empathy(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(1), Taunt(1),\u00a0<br/>\n 10: Animal Empathy(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(1), Spot(1),\u00a0<br/>\n 11: Animal Empathy(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(1), Taunt(1),\u00a0<br/>\n 12: Animal Empathy(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(1), Spot(1),\u00a0<br/>\n 13: Animal Empathy(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(1), Taunt(1),\u00a0<br/>\n 14: Animal Empathy(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(1), Spot(1),\u00a0<br/>\n 15: Animal Empathy(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(1), Taunt(1),\u00a0<br/>\n 16: Animal Empathy(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(1), Spot(1)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Equipment:<br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\n<br/>\n Weapons:<br/>\n - for ranged combat I used the Elven Court Bow (Longbow, Attack Bonus +3, Mighty +3) obtained in ch1 finale from the Helm spirit for a long time. Then I bought a Composite Longbow +3 (Attack bonus +3, Mighty +5) from Husher Clay in ch3, and that was my weapon of choice in the final combat with Morag.<br/>\n - for melee combat first I used a mundane Double Axe, and I wanted to use a double axe till the end... then I realized that Blade Thirst only lasts 1 round per level, and it is an expansion spell, so I switched to Drone +1 / Ice Reaver +1, then in ch3 upgraded to Drone +4 (Morningstar, 1d6 sonic\u00a0bonus damage, On Hit: Slow DC=14 50% / 2 Rounds) / Ice Reaver +3 (Hand Axe, 1 cold bonus damage, Cold Resist 15 / -)<br/>\n<br/>\n Armor for combat:<br/>\n - Helmet: Golden Circlet (+1 Will save, spell resist 10, +1 concentration, immune to mind-affecting spells)<br/>\n - Body: Shadow Legion Armor (Base: Leather Armor, +4 Armor AC, +5 to Hide)<br/>\n - Cloak: Cloak of Fortification +3 (+3 Deflection AC, +3 all saves)<br/>\n - Belt: Belt of Hill Giant Strength (+3 STR)<br/>\n - Gloves/Bracers: Bracers of Dexterity +5 (+5 DEX)<br/>\n - Boots: Boots of Speed (Haste)<br/>\n - Amulet: in the final battle I wore Asheera's Amulet (+3 Natural AC vs. Reptilians, +25% immunity to electricity and fire, spell resist 14), but mainly I wore the Pendant of the Elf (+4 DEX, immune to mind-affecting spells)<br/>\n - Ring1: Ring of the Rogue +4 (+4 DEX, +2 to Hide, Move Silently, Open Lock, Disable Trap, Pick Pocket)<br/>\n - Ring2: Ring of Power (15 / - Cold, Electrical, Fire resist, Freedom, Regen +1)<br/>\n<br/>\n Armor for Aarin ;)<br/>\n I bought CHA and persuation enhancing items to persuade :) Prophyro's Ring +4, Belt of the Performer +5, Nymph Cloak +3, Greater Mask of Persuation. With the aid of these items I was able to convince Aribeth to give up herself on fist try. I don't know if I was just lucky, or it isn't that hard to persuade her... but I was a little surprised about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n I also carried a periapt of wisdom +3, and in the last chapter a +5 version to gain some extra spell slots for buffing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Spells:<br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\n<br/>\n Level1: Camouflage, Ultravision, Cure Light Wounds<br/>\n Level2: One with the Land, Protection from Elements, Cat's Grace<br/>\n Level3: Greater Magic Fang, Invisibility Purge<br/>\n Level4: Summon Creature IV, Cure Serious Wounds<br/>\n<br/>\n As you see I cheated the challenge's rules here as I used forbidden spells.

If you fancy challenging yourself a little more, you might want to try Aielund (there's a thread - admittedly a very long one - also in the Modules sub-forum here to help you along, though it's not a walkthrough). I heartily recommend it. It has the benefit of taking your toon up to level 36 or 37 within its four chapters (downloadable from the Vault: there's a link in the aforementioned thread), geat characters and plotline, and will test you significantly more than the OC. Have a look and see what you think.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

There are some mini-boss animals in OC with improved health, and it is also fun to steal the casters' summons, so they fight against them :) The DC for empathy is 15+HD, wich is 27 for dire bears, so that 17 in the end is only 55% success against them. On early levels, like in ch1 prison, it was hard to dominate even a single guard dog, but they served me well until their death (I had a lesser gloves of animal handling to negate the -2 CHA penaly). The mini-bosses (ancient dire bear with 300 hp and pack leader with 250) were so tough, that usually I had to redominate them at least once. I had three methods for this: 1. the domination ended unexpectedly, I ordered my companions to stand ground, and played tag with the animal until I was successful, 2. the forced redominate - save, pause, release, dominate, then unpause if successful, reload if not :D 3. order the animal to stand ground, and go somewhere in the same area where eyesight is lost with the animal, then release and rest. After that go back to the animal in stealth, then cancel stealth, and dominate the animal with a 20 roll (it may be an exploit or bug, as somehow I always rolled 20 this way).<br/>\n I had many failed attempts in ch1 and ch2, but from ch3 usually I were succesful on first or second try.\n<blockquote><div><strong>HipRedux wrote:</strong><hr/>\n Can you give a feel on how successful (how much AC penalty) the effect was as you progressed from module to module?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n I can't tell you much about taunt, as it was only part of the concept, so I used it maybe two or three times in ch1 (maybe against Drawl and a gang leader and the guard at Meldanen's estate... I can't remember exactly), but never after that. The reason is that I was mainly a ranged fighter, while taunt is a melee skill, or at least you have to move in melee range to use it, and you are flat-footed while you taunt... since a ranger does not have uncanny dodge, my not so high AC would drop by 10 points (6 from DEX and 4 dodge ac from haste). I can tell you that on early levels with cc taunt and a heavy cha penalty the chance is only around 50% for a minor success, and even worse if you want a better result than a -1-2 AC. I can also replay the very last part of ch4 with taunt to see how it works (I will have a bonus there against those reptilians from fav enemy), but I don't have saves from ch2 and ch3. Anyway I'm planning to play a taunt barb with some bard multiclass, I will use more taunt with that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Well, I have a ranger question for everyone about fav enemies... what races would you choose in OC? The undead was obviously a good choice (there are many undead-heavy areas, and you can't crit them, so the extra damage is handy), but the construct and dragon does not seem to be that good (there aren't that many constructs in OC, and I killed the dragons with traps, not with weapons). The reptilian humanoids could be a fairly good choice on lvl 15 for the grand finale, but not on 10. So what would you choose on 5 and 10? I thought about elementals, outsiders, maybe giants or some PC races, but none of them seems to be that good as the undead. So what then?<br/>\n<br/>\n About the alignment change and Gorgotha: I regret to kill her :( as I said it wasn't necessary, since I was already at lvl 15, and the loot wasn't even that good to worth it.<br/>\n There are some parts in ch2 where you can gain an alighment shift towards evil, with some not-that-evil acts. Two of these links to the bounty hunt quest and one to the werewolf quest. The fist is Wyvern's case if you let him run. His and Zor's case is undersantdable I think. Okay, Wyvern killed those soldiers, but he was driven by revenge, as they brutally murdered his family. I think this is more like a lawful-chaotic act, not a good-evil. The second is Yesgar's case if you kill him. He kidnapped and raped that poor girl Shaldrissa, you don't even know why they put him into prison, and you are evil if you kill him... ridiculous. The third is Sir Kharatis if you threaten him to take the silver charm. If you do the same with the other three boys you don't gain evil points IIRC, only with Sir Karathis... strange.<br/>\n<br/>\n P.S. Stag, Gragor is 'she', not 'he' ;)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I rip them apart with crits, and 2. Tomi dealt great damage to them with sneaks.<br/>\n(Maybe I forgot to mention that Tomi accompanied me through the whole campaign. First he started as a melee sneaker, but he died too much, so I ordered him to use his bow somewhere in the middle of ch2. After that he survived the fights much easier.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother interesting thing, that you may or may not know. In ch2 finale and ch3 you cannot open the thief stores unless you have some points in roguish skill. To be exact you have to spend at least one point on one of the following skills: set trap, disable trap, open lock or pick pocket.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hey guys!<br/>\nThis years OC2002 style half-orc playtrough is... a pure paladin.<br/>\nHere's the build:<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>\n</details>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>\nWeapon: blessing of the daystar - the true paladin sword, however I couldn't use its +5 ench against undead, because I got it so late there were no undead enemies left nowhere... its +3 regular ench is still good, and the +1d6 fire damage against evil is a good evil detector, so I don't waste my smites. Until the point I found this I used astral blade +1 and +2 from Marrok and Barun.\nArmor: balduran's armor - +2 AC half-plate, but its +3 charisma is more important. +1 regen is also a nice bonus.\nRing1: ring of power - some elemental resist, freedom and +1 regen... its really a powerful ring.\nAmulet: amu of the uthgardt - +4 str yeah, spell resist 12 meh, immun: fear... lol, pallys are already immune.\nBracers: bracers of dex +4 - +4 dex, it aids the AC and the reflex saves a bit... its better than the ogre power gauntlets, because I can cast bulls, but I cant cast cats. I highly considered a bracers of armor +5 in ch4, but I stayed with the dex bracers for -1 AC but +2 reflex save (there are a lot of nasty traps in the source stone that tommy can't disarm).\nHelmet: greater mask of persuasion - obviously that +2 charisma was the main reason here, but that bonus to persuade was also handy.\n</details>\n<br/>\nMy experiences about the build:<br/>\n16 str for a pure warrior class is enough in every part of the game. If you buff your str with the best items you can find, and maybe spells, you will not have any serious problem hitting enemies. Well... maybe dragons could take a bit longer to defeat.<br/>\nSmite is a fairly good ability, and extra smite is very handy when you fight against the toughest evil foes. Charisma was a bit low on lower levels, but AB was still enough to hit.<br/>\nTurning is a bit useless in my opinion. There were a very few situations where I could use it effectively. Usually zombies are the best targets for turning, and skeletons are the worst. I couldnt turn a single skeleton warrior or chieftain ever because of their so high turn resistance.<br/>\nTaunt was good. Even the toughest foes (dragons, balors, aribeth, maugrim, morag, etc) couldnt resist my taunts. It worked well throughout the whole game.<br/>\nPersuade was also a godly skill. I could persuade almost everyone in the game for more info, higher rewards, lower prices, etc. There were only a few situations where I failed, but I think there were no option to succeed there (for example the leader of the eagle tribe in moonwood seemed to be impossible to persuade for a better reward).<br/>\nSaves: they were so high because of divine grace, that in the end I usually saved against the stongest traps. Will and fort was rarely a problem also.<br/>\nLay on hands comes pretty handy if you have a high charisma. It can save your or your henchmans life in tight situations. Usually its better than a potion, because it does not provoke an AoO.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpells:<br/>\nI used the few old buffs that the OC2002 rules does not forbid. Bulls, eagles, endure/resist elements, bless, prayer, death ward. They are not gamechanging spells, but they helped a bit in the toughest fights.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used Tommy as a hench because of his trap disarming and lockpicking skills, and his sneaks also helped me a lot. I ordered him to use his bow, this way I was really a tank, and he picked the enemies from distance. Sometimes you have to micromanage him to come closer to sneak range, but its nothing you cant handle.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell... thats it for now. If you have questions feel free to ask them.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The only areas where it was really effective are those where the weaker types of zombies appear in large numbers. My favourite was the first level of the Ruins of Illusk in ch2 finale. Zombies and weak zombies everywhere, I could destroy pretty large group of them with each turning attempt. There are a few other undead which are affected, like skeletons and skeleton mages (but not the warriors and the chieftains), mummies (though they are just scared away, not destroyed instantly), and iirc some of the cursts and vampires maybe. The rest are unaffected however because of their turn resistance.<br/>\nIt would be interesting to see if a cleric focused on turning (pure cleric, sun domain, heavy charisma investment) could break the resistance of the stronger undead.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout Tommy :D I'm really sorry, it's some sort of habit to take Tommy with me if I don't have any oppurtunities to open locks and disarm traps. Well, any other than bashing the locked doors and chests and walk right into the traps. However I promise my next half-orc will have some tools to do these him/herself. Probably I will take Boddyknock with me, because I heard he is completely useless with the vanilla AI ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nEmpyre was right, that ring is the reward for completing the quests for Boddyknock, and just like Empyre, I'm also doing those quests for every henchmen. Even if the items are useless for the build, I still get the XP, and some of them have really interesting stories if you have the patience to read the whole conversation :)<br/>\nI agree that the golden circlet's mind immunity is powerful, but I didn't have any serious problem with mind spells at the time when that helmet was easily accessible. The pally has an innate immunity to fear, and the most common attack against mind is the fear effect (you know, fear auras everywhere), and also the clarity potion is always there if I'm unsure what is ahead.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
