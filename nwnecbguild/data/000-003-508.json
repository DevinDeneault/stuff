      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hi again. As always, I try not to ask build something for me, but show another one, that I start to build and need to improve a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly, I need to let you know, what problem I have. On PW I play, there are few locations with tough, dangerous and rich monsters, all better items including +5 ones can be found here. Those monsters are made for 21-30 lvl characters, so, my build must start really shine on those levels. Opponents, that I have to beat, are a little groups with 2-4 chars in each group, we have here one duergar cleric with all cleric goodness including harm(it's remade and need high fort save or immunity to negative energy), word of faith, hammer of gods, and 1-3 duergar tough dev-critting fighters with good AB(around 33-35) and AC (around 45). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo. Mission is in making character with 21-30 levels (but it's still 40 lvl character in long-term strategy) to beat them all and grab all their treasures )<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I was think about: we have few caster classes, which have shapechanging spells (druid, wizard, sorcerer) and they all have forms, which are immune to critical hits, BUT, since all of them can be dispelled, it's a bad choice, I think. Next, shifters. Undead form ith really bad here, cause all of them can be turned by clerics, so this leave us only construct shape, strong choice, but... )<br/>\n<br/>\nThat leave me with only PM build, and here is starting version of it:<br/>\n<br/>\nBard(16), Blackguard(6), Pale Master(18), Human, NE or CE<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 16 (30)<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 14<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 12<br/>\nCHA: 16<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Bard(1): Power Attack, Cleave<br/>\n02: Bard(2)<br/>\n03: Bard(3): Toughness<br/>\n04: Bard(4): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n05: Bard(5)<br/>\n06: Bard(6): Great Cleave<br/>\n07: Bard(7)<br/>\n08: Bard(8): STR+1, (STR=18)<br/>\n09: Blackguard(1): Weapon Focus: Rapier<br/>\n10: Blackguard(2): {Smite Good}<br/>\n11: Blackguard(3)<br/>\n12: Bard(9): STR+1, Blind Fight, (STR=19)<br/>\n13: Bard(10)<br/>\n14: Blackguard(4)<br/>\n15: Blackguard(5): Extend Spell<br/>\n16: Blackguard(6): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n17: Bard(11)<br/>\n18: Bard(12): Improved Critical: Rapier<br/>\n19: Pale Master(1)<br/>\n20: Pale Master(2): STR+1, (STR=21)<br/>\n21: Pale Master(3): Great Strength I, {Darkvision}, (STR=22)<br/>\n22: Bard(13)<br/>\n23: Pale Master(4)<br/>\n24: Pale Master(5): STR+1, Overwhelming Critical: Rapier, (STR=23)<br/>\n25: Pale Master(6)<br/>\n26: Pale Master(7)<br/>\n27: Bard(14): Great Strength II, (STR=24)<br/>\n28: Pale Master(8): STR+1, (STR=25)<br/>\n29: Pale Master(9)<br/>\n30: Pale Master(10): Devastating Critical: Rapier<br/>\n31: Pale Master(11)<br/>\n32: Bard(15): STR+1, (STR=26)<br/>\n33: Pale Master(12): Great Strength III, (STR=27)<br/>\n34: Pale Master(13) (PM bonus feat - don't really know, what to choose)<br/>\n35: Pale Master(14)<br/>\n36: Pale Master(15): STR+1, Great Strength IV, (STR=29)<br/>\n37: Bard(16)<br/>\n38: Pale Master(16): Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor<br/>\n39: Pale Master(17): Epic Spell: Epic Warding<br/>\n40: Pale Master(18): STR+1, (STR=30)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 407<br/>\nSkillpoints: 210<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 27/25/22<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8<br/>\nBAB: 26<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 37 (melee), 25 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 27/38<br/>\nSpell Casting: Bard(6)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscipline 40(50), Hide 5(4), Listen 22(21), Perform 27(30), Spellcraft 39(40), Tumble 40(39), UMD 37(40)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Discipline(4), Hide(4), Spellcraft(4), UMD(2), Save(10)<br/>\n02: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Perform(3), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(5), Save(5)<br/>\n03: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(3), Spellcraft(1), Save(5)<br/>\n04: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(8)<br/>\n05: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(11)<br/>\n06: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(3), Spellcraft(1), UMD(5), Save(6)<br/>\n07: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(5), Save(4)<br/>\n08: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(2), Spellcraft(1), Save(5)<br/>\n09: Discipline(1), Save(8)<br/>\n10: Discipline(1), Save(11)<br/>\n11: Discipline(1), Save(14)<br/>\n12: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(4), Tumble(5), UMD(5), Save(3)<br/>\n13: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(7)<br/>\n14: Discipline(1), Save(10)<br/>\n15: Discipline(1), Save(13)<br/>\n16: Discipline(1), Save(16)<br/>\n17: Discipline(1), Perform(3), Spellcraft(4), Tumble(5), UMD(5), Save(4)<br/>\n18: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(8)<br/>\n19: Spellcraft(1), Save(11)<br/>\n20: Spellcraft(1), Save(14)<br/>\n21: Spellcraft(1), Save(17) <br/>\n22: Discipline(4), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(5), UMD(5), Save(8)<br/>\n23: Spellcraft(1), Save(11)<br/>\n24: Spellcraft(1), Save(14)<br/>\n25: Spellcraft(1), Save(17)<br/>\n26: Spellcraft(1), Save(20)<br/>\n27: Discipline(5), Perform(10), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(5), UMD(5)<br/>\n28: Listen(2), Spellcraft(1), Save(1)<br/>\n29: Spellcraft(1), Save(4)<br/>\n30: Spellcraft(1), Save(7)<br/>\n31: Spellcraft(1), Save(10)<br/>\n32: Discipline(5), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(5), UMD(5)<br/>\n33: Spellcraft(1), Save(3)<br/>\n34: Spellcraft(1), Save(6)<br/>\n35: Spellcraft(1), Save(9)<br/>\n36: Spellcraft(1), Save(12)<br/>\n37: Discipline(5), Listen(1), Perform(2), Tumble(5), UMD(5)<br/>\n38: Listen(4)<br/>\n39: Listen(4)<br/>\n40: Listen(4)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow need your help to improve it.

Well, I think theese build will be good agains them, especially with ED and HiPs, but there are 2 reasons, why I even don't write about them - first, I can still catch those dev.crits and die immediately, and this scares me a little, second - dex builds can't carry all those rare items and stuff, which they give in their loot bags. Firstly I think about some STR-based asassin/SD, but STR-based means less AC, and this means that characters life will be short and painfull...<br/>\n<br/>\nUPD: Oh, I forgot something ) HiPS moved to 3rd SD level<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That means (not factoring any buffs), that your \"base schedule\" would be: +37/+32/+27/+22. That last attack will invariably have 5% chance to hit (only if you roll a 20), even more so because you say the AC of your foes is high, so it's not such an indispensible thing to have IMO. The BAB you lose by going RDD is recovered by the Strength gain that the class gives you. Your BAB in my suggested alternative would be 14 at lvl 20, but your Strength would end up at 38, effectively giving you +2 AB in comparison to yours, even with one attack less. That also means that if you have access to Divine Power scrolls in abundance, you will have +1 attack at FULL BAB instead of -15 for the duration of the spell. This was recently explained by Kail in the topic Battle Priestess, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a general rule, though, you can't be a critical immune, heavy-hitting, high AB, damage dealing, self buffing juggernaut. You need to choose between mutually exclusive things: The more PM levels you take, the earlier you become immune to criticals and the higher your AC is with bone skin (not to mention epic spells), but in order to achieve that, your buffs, spells and bard song will suffer because of your heavy investment in PM. We had a discussion about this kind of thing in the WoG forums, and people were saying exactly that. Novice builders have a tendency to want to achieve too much with a build, and end up being mediocre in all areas rather than good at something. Your stats are low, your self-buffing capability is somewhat limited in this build except through scrolls, so your AB will be low regardless. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother important point here is the level distribution. You end up in 18 PM levels. That is the same as 16, so those two levels can be put into BG for +1 BAB, or bard for better spell durations and such. Roughly, though, I think this build needs somewhat radical changes. You need to decide what is more important to you and stick with it. Honestly, for what you are saying there, I would suggest going either with the Bard PM RDD combo (14 16 10 or 11 19 10) or Cleric Bard PM. Why? Because Clerics can afford to have low BAB, as they're specialists in self-buffing. You can either go Cleric 15 Bard 6 PM 19 and be dispellable but have access to Epic Warding and Epic Mage Armor or Cleric 26 Bard 4 PM 10 and have lower AC but be undispellable. You would end up with low BAB, but the Cleric's capacity to self-buff is AMAZING. You could go Cleric 12 Bard 3 PM 5 or Cleric 15 Bard 3 PM 2 pre-epic and get critical immune earlier by going straight PM on epics.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will see what I can come up with later this week, cuz now I have no time. Think about what I said, plz.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I am noticing the exact same thing in many requests that seem to believe there is a mystical exploit that will create an all-purpose, godly build out of just about any concept.

Never is one wrong to quote a Mithdradates build!<br/>\n<br/>\nD'alessandro,<br/>\n<br/>\nI would tweak a bit on that build you posted for the original intent, in order to get PM as high as possible as fast as possible. +2 fully buffed AB and +3 AC points difference from Cleric 12 to Cleric 15 won't make much of a difference, but the earlier epic spells would, so I would personally go PM straight and leave the cleric levels from 37-40 alongside the bard level. I would also take Epic Warding before Epic Mage Armor, as having 50/+20 DR and immunity to criticals is a hell of a combo. They will only do extra damage to you via darkfire, which goes to address the PM bonus feat. Put Epic Energy Resistance Fire to deal with Darfire / Flame Weapon or Acid to deal with Mestil's Acid Sheath. With your very high AC i`d go for Acid.<br/>\n<br/>\n11 points on Heal there seem wasted. you could put 5 more in UMD as it's never too much to have. The rest, if you have nowhere better to place, Heal is fine. I would consider dropping Taunt for Discipline, unless you got KD-immune items in the server.

Epic Warding and critical immunity is a hell of a combo and with Epic Mage Armor and bone skin bonus AC there are VERY FEW opponents that will manage to hit you. I agree with you that Cleric is awesome, but it seems to me as you consider only one type of usage for it. I don't. I have builds that utilize their full casting potential and builds that just take advantage of their self-buffing potential, and builds that do both, like my Demolition Man build, etc... You may be remembering the time when you played and the places where you played, but in WoG, your suggested tactics of herding would work very poorly, as the generally herdable mobs give worthless XP, but they can kick butt. The real XP is in boss battles, and those are generally tough and have improved AI scripts. My point here is, I would consider 9 lvls of PM of equal value as the 9 levels of Cleric. Here is why:<br/>\n<br/>\nCleric will give much better offensive capabilities, like SoV, more Firestorms and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nPM will give much better defensive capabilities: +4 AC from Bone Skin (or even +6 AC if you went PM 20 as I later saw you could); +5 Dodge AC from Epic Mage Armor, plus the capability to rework your ENTIRE INVENTORY as you won't need any +5 or lesser AC items, and to rework your spellbook in order to fit more offensive spells, as you won't need any of your AC enhancements; Epic Warding gives 50/+20 DR for 1 round per lvl which is effectively like nearly 1000 HP. Together with critical hit immunity and a very high AC from EMA + Boneskin (all of which are attained by increasing PM levels) makes you an even better meleer, but a worse offensive caster. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I'm a fan of clerics, but not nearly as frantic about them as you are, so I can see the beauty in the rest of the classes as well <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Warding is ok, but NOT to the detriment of loosing SOV, imo.  You still have imm to crit, but now you are much more diverse.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou are also correct: I play the cleric to WIN!  I dont fancy foot around.   Herding is ONE tactic, and if it doesnt work, so what?  I have countless others at my disposal.  My point in referencing it is that people think that clerics are \"party buffers\", not killers.  They can do both roles, but only noobs get sucked into the role of buffer.  The cleric is much to valuable to NOT be out in front.<br/>\n<br/>\nEMA, with a cleric is +5 dodge, IF THAT!  A total waste of a feat spell and 3 pm lvls (clerics can boost dodge ac to the limit, no troubles).  As to the other, the cleric already has +5 to shield, armor, deflection (possibly natural if take Plant).  Your argument, this frees up inventory as well.  Taking warding, well, again, you forfeit 5 or 6 lvls of cleric, which is not smart.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can play the cleric so many ways.  I ALWAYS chose to play it offensively.  You are telling him to play it defensively, which i will NEVER agree with!  It is for the new player, and even that is wrong!  Just because \"everyone\" does it doesnt make it right, REGARDLESS of environment.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI found I could only play WoG for 3 days.  It was way to boring for my taste.  I always felt that if you do the work, you should be compensated appropriately.  IT took my 3 days to go from lv 2 to 3 (or what ever the starting lvl was).  For a player new to that server, I found it very tedious and unwelcoming.  This was in 2008 or so, so maybe things have changed.  When you tell me that \"the boss fights give the big xp\", well, i say MOVE ON!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI could care less who plays there!  I have known and respected Kail, Cinn, griz, et al for years, but we dont play the same way.  What they like (WoG) I dont.  What I like, they dont.  That's why we have choice.  Regardless, if I had like WoG I would have invested the time to find the holes in it (like I did on the other servers I played for lengths of time) if there are any.  The cleric class has that many options!  In general, a cleric/pm is the BEST melee class for a dev crit environment.  To make it fun, take dev crit too.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Undeath's Eternal Foe doesn't give Dodge AC anymore, now it gives +4 to deflection and no longer stacks with itself, so EMA is GREAT. The only other way to achieve dodge cap would be through Divine Shield and high charisma, which is not the case here. So like I said, since you haven't played in a while a lot has changed. Maybe now you can understand the merit behind my argument here. Besides, I NEVER play cleric defensively, the high AC would be used in this build to kill all the monsters you herd by kicking their asses . Just standing there and firing punishment, with the occasional DevCrit.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust so you know, you may not remember but the Divine Power / Haste exploit has been slightly reworked in a way it's still better to have 3 attacks per round rather than 4 with a cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nbefore: say your AB is 40 with DP and Haste. Your schedule would be<br/>\n<br/>\n+40/+35/+30/+40 (DP)/+40(Haste).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow: same deal, 40 AB, your schedule will be:<br/>\n<br/>\n+40/+35/+30/+40 (Haste)/+35 (DP)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow each extra attack is added at -5 from the previous in case of multiple extra attacks. If you turned on Rapid Shot, for example, the above would become:<br/>\n<br/>\n+38/+33/+28/+38/+33/+28<br/>\n<br/>\npretty different from what you were used to back in the day. This feels a little like Magic:The Gathering, where they make a point to create a special ability that fucks over all previously existing special abilities (A.K.A \"X\" cannot be killed), and then in the next patch they release a card with a special ability to screw with that new overpowered ability, like \"Removes target card from the game\". So now it's not killed, but it can be removed from the game, so your precious mighty ultra unkillable card is now worthless. They do that stuff to keep you buying <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I think I've proven my point, but I also understand yours, using the settings the way they were back when you used to play. If things were still that way, then I would agree with you completely <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Cleric 12 Bard 4 PM 4 is a good BAB start. You can drop 1 BAB and go Cleric 12 Bard 3 PM 5 so you can squeeze a skill dump at lvl 22 and me in really good shape to take on the enemies he mentioned.<br/>\n<br/>\nBard 6 is truly unnecessary, I agree. When I thought of the spread, I thought Cleric buffs cap at 15 so at least 15 lvls of cleric are needed, and EMA and EW require 2 bonus feats after PM 15 so 16 and 19, then I threw the leftovers into bard . In fact, you could consider going Cleric 16 Bard 5 PM 19 or Cleric 15 Bard 5 PM 20. The first alternative would grant you a few spell slots and a little more durations, while the latter would grant you +2 boneskin AC. Less than 5 Bard IMO is undoable, as he will have to spend too much of his life without skill updates because he'd have to take the 3rd level of bard at 15 to start pumping PM and then the next one after 37 if he went Bard 4. By going Bard 5 he can get one extra skill dump in the middle, which is absolutely necessary to face the monsters he was talking about in mid 20s. That can be done at lvl 17 then going Bard 4 Cleric 12 PM 4 for +1 BAB or at lvl 22, which would mean -1 BAB but a later skill dump. I would personally go for Bard 4 PM 4 Cleric 12 and then the last bard between 37 and 40.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Again, what do I know?  Oh right!  LOL  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo give up an epic slot for +5 dodge, i truly dont understand.  Warding, according to Wiki ( and I have to use that, as the warding i am used to was PRC, and VERY powerful in comparison) is 50/+20 per ROUND or 16 rounds.  That is BARELY a fight, in my estimation.  AND you are giving up 6 levels to the cause.  WOW!  <br/>\n<br/>\nI totally understand getting Dev crit as early as possible.  You could get it earlier, but it means becoming the Orc!  muhahahahahaha.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI know one thing, you will not be satisfied with the build the way you are laying it out.  15 cleric is very weak for a meleer.  PM, besides immune, has NOTHING to give to meleers.  And you are using Bard.  That is 3 strikes for melee build.  You will be struggling for the entire build.  So what if you dont die on a 1 to dev crit?  You wont be killing anything either!   This is a DEFENSIVE build designed to NOT DIE!  You should be thinking about KILLING EVERYTHING!  You cannot play a defensive build offensively.  You just wont have the tools to do it.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThat Hip and maxi are encouraging this sort of behaviour makes me sad.  when I joined the ECB it was to learn how to make KICK ASS characters.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I have at least 2 15-clerics who KICK THE CRAP OUT OF EVERYTHING they run into melee-wise. Tell me, what is it that any lvl 9 cleric spells add to a meleer's attack and damage?? NOTHING! All the BUFFS are 8 or lower and that is considering taking War Domain on a dex build and have Extended AoV at lvl 8, cuz other than that, not even level 8 spells can be used for buffs. Besides, What Cleric buffs, other than for durations, get enhanced after level 15?? The only one is Shield of Faith, which gets +1 at 18, but that`s hardly worth it. Undeath's Eternal Foe now gives DEFLECTION AC, so it has become worthless for this build.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree that this is a defensive build, and that's what I read between the lines in the OP's intentions, but saying that this doesn't kick the living crap out of everything with Cleric 15 is insane, even for someone as fanatic as you. Going Cleric 15 gives you all you need as a self-buffer, and the low durations are compensated by taking multiple copies of the same spells. Having Strength domain, he can have 5 Divine Powers and 6 Extended Divine Powers, 9 Divine Favors and 8 Extended Divine Favors. Laso, going 15 or 16 Cleric makes it so that you don't need to pump your Wisdom to 19, freeing more stat points for STR. +5 Dodge AC and +6 NATURAL AC (not enhancement) from the extra bone skin adds up to a total +11 AC difference between your suggested build and this one. 50/+20 DR combined with the ability to be immune to criticals, I state again, is a HELL OF A COMBO.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a quick look into AB here:<br/>\n<br/>\nBAB = 24 + 8 STR + 4 WF/EWF/EP + 20 Buffs = 56 + 6 if he can cap str (which is likely due to not having to worry about AC enhancements) = 62.<br/>\n<br/>\nFully Buffed Capped STR Schedule: +62/+57/+52/+62(Haste)/+57(Divine Power).<br/>\n<br/>\nI do agree and understand your point that your suggested build would have more offence in it, but by no means would a cleric 15 PM 20 variant be considered wimp. That is an overstatement. Like I told the OP when I suggested this class combo initially: Cleric 26 Bard 4 PM 10 is a more offensive alternative, is undispellable, has more spells and higher durations. Cleric 15 Bard 5 PM 20 gives up undispellability, durations and some spell slots for +11 AC, Epic Warding and the ability to equip only items that give you stat enhances, because if it's a +5 or lower environment, all the AC enhancements except shield would be covered. I think from now on it's a matter of preference. However, there is little point in continuing this discussion, as old dogs don't learn new tricks, especially old retired from NWN dogs .<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You just randomly picked levels to put bard in with ABSOLUTELY no logic. Read my guide, mate! Let me enlighten you:<br/>\n<br/>\nStart as Bard, you gain more skill points this way. You won't be able to take Extend Spell, so take Power Attack instead. Now you don't need to worry about AB anytime because you're a Cleric, so leave the Weapon Focus for later, prioritize Cleave, KD, Extend Spell. Take Bard on levels 1, 12 and 15 anc all Cleric inbetween. Then PM at 16, 17, Bard 18 and PM 19 and 20. That way you can maintain UMD and Tumble at full for the first 20 levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nForget about Bard at 28 and 33, because Bard 6 gives you nothing, so take Bard 5 at 38 and be done with it. You will be without UMD and Tumble updates for a while, but it will grant you +2 AC from Bone Skin, which will make you even harder to hit. As for domains, Travel and Trickery are good, but you could also consider Strength for another level of Divine Power. Problem is, which one to drop? If there are no permanent haste items in your server, then leave domains as they are, but if you can find them, drop Travel for Strength.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, I would consider it a good build. I want to start working on something like this myself, but right now I don't have time.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

However, I do agree that Mith's build is a masterpiece, but it seems to me that to the OP's original intent (High AC and immunity to criticals without too much lost on the AB side), one with both epic spells would be more suitable.

IMO for what he intends with it, it's good as is.</div></blockquote>He already has 18 Wis and the extra spell slots (+1 lvl 4/5/6 spells, +2 lvl 7/8 spells, +4 lvl 9 spells) and caster level from going cleric 20 vs cleric 15 constitute a huge advantage. A cleric has no spell failure so giving up spells that are easily gonna change the outcome of a battle cause one doesn't want to cast much means not using the class properly. One doesn't need cleric at all to build a crit immune dev critter, if one is to use cleric let's get the most out of it. Just some thoughts.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

However, that has been suggested over and over again and the OP doesn't seem to relish the idea. That's why I came up with this alternative spread that focuses more on the PM side. I wouldn't recommend going 20 4 16 and not taking 20 wisdom. If he does decide to go with that, I 'd consider a higher WIS score as a must have.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
