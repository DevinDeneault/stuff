      "content": "<div>Hello guys. I have another build request for ya. I am thinking about a Ranger/fighter/WM or anthing along those lines.This is for a low/mid magic server and lvl cap is 30. Farming goes to about lvl 23 then its all exp for Rping. So I would like to get the best I can by lvl 23. I want to be able to have BOE and get a good AB going. It would be nice to duel wield and if called for switch to a shield for more AC. I was thinking human or Elf but prob. human is best for all the feats I need? I am not sure what would be best a Dex or Str. build? Dev crit on this server can be had by only non-hybrid toons. So not sure if Dex build would be better so I can get Epic Dodge or Str. build and at least get overwhelming if its worth it. I am up for anything though, just here to pick your brains. Thanks for your time.</div>"

You''ll need to focus in a light weapon for a medium race (i.e. any small weapon), like shortsword, for instance.  For halflings &amp; gnomes, a light weapon would be a tiny one.\n<blockquote><div>Oh dam I overlooked something...On this server I have to take 5 lvls of any class I take at any giving time.

Actually, in PvP, you can make most things work, if it is for groups.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few others off the top of mye head:<br/>\nCleric21/F2/WM7 (not too fond of WM7, but with Cleric buffs, damage rocks)<br/>\nRanger21+/SD1/whatever (if true seeings been changed). Works just fine as Strength based too.<br/>\nBard16/F4/RDD10 would be a good build, even Bard20/RDD10 for lasting inspiration.<br/>\nCleric16/Monk9/SD5 could be sweet, for DEX base and EpicDodge. Doesn't sound too good perhaps, but try it. Elf. Dispelling sucks, so unnerfed True seeing is lame.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as I said, Arcane Casters will rule the battlefield. If True Seeing is like in PnP, then they can be hurt, but I still want my Holysword back.<br/>\n<br/>\nDruid combo with Dragonshape perhaps, since you say it's low magic. Tough to build a Dragon with 30 lvls though.<br/>\n<br/>\n*EDIT* you need 5 lvls of a class, which makes a couple of the above unavailible.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleric23/WM7 might be doable, but I think I'd rather Tumble it with Rogue.<br/>\nThe bard would be Bard15/Fighter5/RDD10. Not too bad a trade, you'll lose a litte songpower, but you can get 16BAB pre-Epic and still get EWS.<br/>\nRanger splits would 25/5 always, with rogue as your best bet, I'd say.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry for not readint thoroughly at first.

As I said you have a caster Druid zen archer which can make good use of shapechange and which should make good use of summons and of his animal companion and dominated animals early on. CoT is needed in order to get enough wisdom by lvl 30 and it grants a further bonus feat (here spent on EP but you might opt for AS). Monk lvls are spaced on tumble dumps levels and lvl 9 druid spells are in by lvl 21. Saves are pretty nice and are gonna be impressive in dragon form.

Keep present that Disable traps just needs 1 rank to let you autorecover your own traps. Set traps can be increased to a modified score of 15 (modified by dex after gear/buffs and by gear that affects set traps directly) so that you can set all deadly traps but gas ones, but you have to take away skillpoints from somewhere (for example some from AE, some from Spellcraft and some from Concentration or Discipline). With 1 rank in Set traps you can set minor traps which are very useful early on and can keep being useful even later on... of course going up to 15 (keep present available buffs/gear) would be better.</div>"

You say you are new to this, so let me tell you something that may disappoint you a bit but that we all know and that you need to know as well:<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE CHARACTER SHEET LIES!!<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the lies is that it gives you the impression that Weapon Focus Unarmed works while shifted, but it doesn't.<br/>\nSize modifiers to AB and AC are also not shown in you sheet. Dragons, for instance, are huge creatures, so they get an AB and AC size modifier of -2 which is not shown in the sheet. Furthermore, the Dragon Claws you attack with are counted as +6 weapons for all purposes, which is also not shown in the character sheet. This means that your AB and AC in Dragon Shape are actually +4 and -2 respectively from what is shown in your sheet. The +4 is because you need to add +6 from the dragon claws -2 from size modifier.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.: Does anyone know the FULL LIST of the Character Sheet lies? What it counts and what it doesn't? Maybe someone can post a topic in the General Discussion forum to help out the newer players. I would do it myself, but RL is kinda hard right now (haven't even been able to play NWN in 2 weeks) and I'm not sure I know all of the lies it tells.</div>"

Bards are good devcritters when they can squeeze in Curse song. Dev crit will make you feat starved, There are still feats that is in the category \"good to have\" that is not in the build now.<br/>\nIf you want listen, which you can Amplify(bard spell, +20 listen) you'll have to start with 14 INT.

In many environments a longsword trumps, because there are more good weapons availible. You should go for weapons with bonuses other than enchantment. Bard has both Greater Magic Weapon and Keen edge on his list.<br/>\n<br/>\nExpertise is just something I like in my melee casters, to get a bit extra AC while casting, or perhaps when you activate song. You don't combat cast much as bard, but sometimes you need the ImpInvis or Darkness. Expertise is, although nice, definitely not make-or-break. You don't have IKD in there, and not any save bolsters f.ex. Sometimes I use Expertise in a group just to stay alive so the others benefit from my song also.</div>"
