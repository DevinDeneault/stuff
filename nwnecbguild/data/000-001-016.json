I've made and played quite a few minor class Monk builds and I was interested in expanding my knowledge on this topic, so I thought it was time to write such a guide up. I'll give it a go! I'm fully aware other builders have played much more Monk than I have so I'm welcoming of feedback from other builders if there is any critique of the content I've created, or if I've missed anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"font-size:150%;line-height:normal\">Introduction</span></strong><br/>\nMonk is a versatile warrior class which as a primary (or major) class is quite powerful defensively and offensively against physical damage, and against spells (particularly with Diamond Soul). As a minor class it provides tremendous benefits as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few guides out there which discuss Monk as a primary (or major) class. For example <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/188666-neverwinter-nights/faqs/18281\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ELaRusic's Monk Guide on GameFAQs</a>\u00a0(for players new to the class), <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.gamebanshee.com/neverwinternights/strategies/monk.php\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Trenchard's Monk Guide on GameBanshee</a> (for players new to the class)\u00a0and\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/worldofgreyhawkfr/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=4720&amp;p=60439\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Knight_ofLimbo's Monks: An analysis</a>\u00a0(for advanced players).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis guide will be limited to discussing Monk as a minor class. Such a topic is still sizable to cover and would be aimed at intermediate and advanced players. I haven't identified any guides which particularly focus on this topic so I think I'm adding to what is out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the purpose of this guide I will define minor class as not more than the highest class level in a build. For a pre-epic build (up to character level 20), I would define it as 10 levels or less. For an epic build (up to character level 40) I would define it as 20 levels or less.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"font-size:150%;line-height:normal\">The Basics of the Monk Class</span></strong> (for more details read\u00a0the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Monk\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Monk NWN Wiki Page</a>)<br/>\nAlignment restriction: Any Lawful<br/>\nHit die: d8<br/>\nBase attack bonus +3/4 levels<br/>\nSkill points: 4 +Int modifier, (4+int modifier)x 4 at 1st level<br/>\nClass skills: Concentration, Craft Armor/Trap/Weapon, Discipline, Heal, Hide, Listen, Lore, Move silently, Parry, Persuade, Tumble<br/>\nPrimary saving throws: fortitude, reflex and will<br/>\nProficiencies: armor (robes), weapons (monk)<br/>\nSpecial: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Unarmed_base_attack_bonus\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Monk unarmed base attack bonus</a>, allows up to 6 attacks per round, 8 attacks per round with Flurry of Blows and Haste, and 10 attacks per round with dual Kamas, Improved Two Weapon Fighting, Flurry of Blows and Haste.\u00a0<br/>\nMonk weapon proficiencies: club, dagger, handaxe, light crossbow, heavy crossbow, quarterstaff, shuriken, kama, sling<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"font-size:150%;line-height:normal\">What Monk Provides in a practical sense for builders </span></strong>(summary of the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Monk\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NWN Wiki table for monks</a>)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll Monk levels: access to class skills listed above, d8 hit die, stunning fist once per day per monk level, pre-epic\u00a0primary saves in Fortitude/Reflex/Will\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 1: BAB 0 (pre-epic only), pre-epic save progression (+2), Cleave, Monk AC bonus (wisdom), Stunning fist, Evasion, Flurry of blows, Improved unarmed strike, Monk unarmed base attack bonus, weapon proficiency (Monk)<br/>\nLevel 2: BAB 1 (pre-epic only), pre-epic save progression (+3), deflect arrows<br/>\nLevel 3: BAB 2 (pre-epic only), monk speed (+10% speed), still mind (+2 to saves against mind affecting spells)<br/>\nLevel 4: BAB 3 (pre-epic only), pre-epic save progression (+4), 1d8 unarmed damage (1d6 unarmed damage as a small character)<br/>\nLevel 5: BAB 3 (pre-epic only), purity of body (immunity to non-magical diseases), +1 Monk AC<br/>\nLevel 6: BAB 4 (pre-epic only), pre-epic save progression (+5), monk speed (+20% speed), knockdown and improved knockdown<br/>\nLevel 7: BAB 5 (pre epic only), wholeness of body (heal damage equal to twice his/her class level, once per day)<br/>\nLevel 8: BAB 6 (pre epic only), pre-epic save progression (+6), 1d10 unarmed damage (1d8 unarmed as a small character)<br/>\nLevel 9: BAB 6 (pre epic only), improved evasion, monk speed (+30% speed)<br/>\nLevel 10: BAB 7 (pre-epic only), pre-epic save progression (+7), ki strike +1, +2 Monk AC<br/>\nLevel 11: BAB 8 (pre-epic only), diamond body (poison immunity)<br/>\nLevel 12: BAB 9 (pre-epic only), pre-epic save progression (+8), diamond soul (spell resistance, monk class level +10), 1d12 unarmed damage (1d10 unarmed as a small character), monk speed (+40% speed)<br/>\nLevel 13: BAB 9 (pre-epic only), ki strike +2<br/>\nLevel 14: BAB 10 (pre-epic only), pre-epic save progression (+9)<br/>\nLevel 15: BAB 11 (pre-epic only), quivering palm, +3 Monk AC, monk speed (+50% speed)<br/>\nLevel 16: BAB 12 (pre-epic only), pre-epic save progression (+10), ki strike +3, 1d20 unarmed damage (2d6 unarmed as a small character)<br/>\nLevel 18: BAB 13 (pre-epic only), pre-epic save progression (+11), empty body (50% concealment, twice per day, 1 round/monk level), monk speed (+60% speed)<br/>\nLevel 20: BAB 15 (pre-epic only), pre-epic save progression (+12), perfect self (immunity to mind-affecting spells, damage reduction 20/+1), +4 Monk AC<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"font-size:150%;line-height:normal\">General comments about taking Monk as a Minor Class</span></strong><br/>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">When to take Monk as a minor class</span></strong><br/>\nTaking a level of Monk will usually strengthen any build, provided the character meets the lawful alignment requirement. Seven free feats for one level plus a tumble or discipline skill dump is no joke. Plus if that level is taken pre-epic a character can gain +2 to all saves in exchange for 1AB.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a character meets the lawful alignment requirement (which will usually exclude Bards and Barbarians), the more important question is whether the benefits of taking Monk outweigh the potential benefits of taking a different class which in the end will be a decision for the builder. It might be a different class provides more useful abilities, or provides a better role play element. From a power-gamers perspective, I will outline conditions in which taking Monk is especially favourable, and conditions in which taking Monk is less favourable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Conditions in which taking Monk is especially favourable</span></strong><br/>\nCertain characters will take great advantage of Monk abilities. These include:<br/>\n- Wisdom based characters such as Clerics and Druids combined with Monk's Wisdom AC, the Stunning Fist and Quivering Palm abilities. For example a character level 40 cleric/monk using robes and no shield with 36 Wisdom (48 when fully capped) will have an extra 13 Wisdom AC (19 AC when wisdom is capped), a Stunning Fist DC of 43-49 and Quivering Palm DC (with sufficient levels of Monk) of 30-36.\u00a0<br/>\n- Polymorph using characters, that use unarmed and unarmored forms to take advantage of Monk Wisdom AC, Monk unarmed attack bonus progression, Monk Speed. This includes Druids, Shifters (unarmed forms), Dragon Shape feat users, casters who make use of the Polymorph self / Shapechange spell. In polymorphed form, the Wisdom attribute remains the same. Therefore polymorphed Druids and Shifters additionally will have powerful Stunning Fist and Quivering Palm abilities as well as high Monk Wisdom AC, if they have high Wisdom scores.<br/>\n- Sneak attack builds (ie Rogue/Assassin/Blackguard) who take advantage of the multiple attacks provided by the Monk's unarmed base attack bonus progression. Doing up to 8 attacks with flurry and haste or 10 attacks with dual Kamas and improved two weapon fighting, combined with Sneak attack is extremely powerful. A player might be able to do 6d6 sneak attack with 3 attacks per round, for example. If that same character does 6 attacks (from Monk UBAB and flurry), that increases potential sneak attack damage from 18d6 (18 to 108 damage) to 36d6 (36 to 216 damage).<br/>\n- Bonus damage per attack builds making use of the multiple attacks provided by the Monk's unarmed base attack bonus progression. Doing up to 8 attacks with flurry and haste or 10 attacks with dual Kamas and improved two weapon fighting, combined with +damage per attack is extremely powerful. This includes Fighters with Weapon Specialisation/Epic Weapon Specialisation, Rangers (with favoured enemies and two weapon fighting/ambidexterity/improved two weapon fighting feats for free in robes), Paladins and Blackguards using the Divine Might ability, Paladin / Clerics (using Divine Favor, Darkfire, Greater Magic Weapon and Divine Might) and Red Dragon Disciples (+8 Str).<br/>\n- Critical hit builds combined with the the Monk's unarmed base attack bonus progression. With the large number of attacks a Monk does, combined with a wide and enhanced critical hit ability (including <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Devastating_critical\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Devastating Critical</a>), means critical hits will occur more often due to the higher number of hits / round.<br/>\n- Builds that wish to obtain Improved Knockdown without requiring INT 13. This includes sneak attack type builds and polymorph builds.\u00a0<br/>\n- Ranged weapon users / ranged spell casters making use of Monk Speed. This allows such classes to stay away from enemies with increased movement speed. Such classes include Arcane Archers, Wizards and Sorcerers.\u00a0<br/>\n- Characters with high reflex saves that do not usually take the Evasion feat (such as Paladins, Blackguards, Champion of Torms, Paladin/Sorcerer builds, Blackguard/Sorcerer builds)<br/>\n- Characters that want access to unbreachable spell resistance (from the Diamond Soul feat)<br/>\n<br/>\n<span class=\"inline-attachment\">\n<dl class=\"fileimage display\">\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/201907/10759084_20a26de8cb9f0cbb23e4f1278504e9e8_t.jpg\" />\n</dl>\n</span>Screenshot of my Druid 8/Monk 1 character Simond Wetter, fighting a Great Wyvern in Bear Form in the Goblin Territories of the Pomarj on the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/worldofgreyhawkfr/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">World of Greyhawk Persistent World server</a>. I'm buffed with Bull's Strength, Barkskin, Stoneskin and other spells. I have a tumble score of 10 from my Monk level for an extra 2 AC. In Bear form, my strength would be between 32-38. When polymorphed into a bear, I retain my Monk Unarmed Base Attack Bonus (essentially doubling the number of my attacks), Monk Wisdom AC and have access to Flurry of Blows and Stunning Fist. As a primary Druid, my Wisdom Score\u00a0 is 20 plus buffs which when added to the Tumble 10 skill obtained through Monk, translates to an additional 7+ AC to my Bear form from my Monk Level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>More details on how Monk enhances\u00a0speed casters</strong><br/>\nI have had to spend a bit of time to understand this concept, and I will try my best to explain. This is from the NWN Wiki on <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Movement_rate\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Movement Rate</a>:<br/>\n<blockquote><div>The maximum modified movement rate is 150% of base speed, with an exception for\u00a0monks\u00a0(level 3 or higher) who can travel at (300 +\u00a0monk speed)% of base speed (this is 430% of base speed for a level 40 monk).\u00a0<br/>\n[...]<br/>\nThe base movement speed of a running\u00a0player character\u00a0is 4\u00a0meters\u00a0per second (mps).\u00a0<br/>\n[...]<br/>\nMovement rates are not affected by\u00a0polymorphing.</div></blockquote>\nAnd this is from the spell NWN Wiki on <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Expeditious_retreat\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Expeditious retreat</a><br/>\n<blockquote><div>[...] This spell has no effect if the caster is already hasted.<br/>\n<br/>\nNotes\u00a0\n<ul>\n<li>Added in the\u00a0expansion packs.</li>\n<li>This spell gives a 50% bonus to movement speed not a 150%.</li>\n<li>The \"if the caster is already hasted\" clause refers specifically to the spell\u00a0<em>haste</em>; other sources of\u00a0haste\u00a0(including\u00a0<em>mass haste</em>) do not block this spell (but the movement rate cap is often relevant).</li>\n<li>This spell stacks with itself (up to the movement rate cap).</li>\n</ul>\n</div></blockquote>\nThe key elements here to understand speed casters are the following:<br/>\n- The Monk Speed feat increases the maximum modified movement rate from 150% of base speed to 310% of base speed at Level 3, and is additive.<br/>\n- The Expeditious Retreat spell movement bonus can stack on itself and is <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">multiplicative</span>.<br/>\n- The standard 'Haste' spell movement speed bonus will not stack with the movement speed increase from Expeditious Retreat.<br/>\n- Other sources of Haste (such as 'Mass Haste' and Haste from Boots of Speed) will stack with Expeditious Retreat and is <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">multiplicative</span>.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if a speed caster, with 3 levels of monk, casts the spells Expeditious Retreat twice on him/herself, or Expeditious Retreat and Mass Haste, they will be able to move very close to the movement speed cap. I have verified this in game. I have also verified that the perma-haste from Boots of Speed also stacks with Expeditious Retreat, but will not stack with the spell 'Mass Haste'.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nWhiZard in his post on the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/speed-caster-sorceror-36-monk-3-paladin-1-t515365.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Speed Caster: Sorcerer 36/Monk 3/Paladin 1</a>, outlined the maths behind Speed Casting in more details, and the benefits of playing a Speed Caster build. This is from his post:\u00a0<br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>WhiZard:</strong><br/>\nSpeed Caster (Sorc 36/Monk 3/Pal 1)<br/>\nThis build features an added benefit to the exalted sorceress template- that is, fast speed. \u00a0The normal 1.5 * base speed cap to movement speed is overridden by monk speed (at monk 3) and stacking of speed bonuses occur as follows: Initial Speed = 1.00(base speed) + 0.1(monk bonus) = 1.10. \u00a0Cast Mass Haste for 1.5 * Initial Speed + 0.1(monk bonus) = 1.5 * 1.1 + 0.1 = 1.75. \u00a0Cast expeditious retreat for 1.5 * Mass Haste Speed + 0.1(monk bonus) = 1.5 * 1.75 + 0.1 = 2.725. That speed can outrun any natural monk (monk 39 moves at 2.30), giving the sorcerer a huge edge in casting and running without getting caught. \u00a0If both spells are extended you can have 7 full turns at this fantastic speed, which is probably enough time to allow you to unleash your spell arsenal.<br/>\nWhat does fast speed give? \u00a0<br/>\nImproved herding skills. \u00a0See that mob of scattered melee enemies all moving the same speed? Simply circle around the mob again and again and watch it cluster together. \u00a0When it becomes a compact group unleash your area of effect spells. \u00a0(Oh, and since your hasted you cast in half the usual time, so while herding you can still cast spells without being attacked).<br/>\nRun past your enemies to the advantageous terrain. \u00a0See that cliff? The way up is far away but you can make it there and run back on top of the cliff, leaving your enemies unable to determine which way to go to reach you.<br/>\nAvoid the bosses. \u00a0 Those nasty monsters that can dish out hundreds of damage with their smite (or whatever power) seem a lot less threatening if they cannot attack before collapsing.<br/>\n<br/>\n[...]<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>WhiZard (reply to HipMaestro):</strong><br/>\nHere's the full description, the formative parts of which can be found in the talk page of the monk article at the NWN wiki.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk speed is an additive bonus reflecting a percentage of the base speed (normal speed with or without encumbrance, stealth/detect mode, running/walking).<br/>\nSpeed increases and decreases (as can be found with haste, slow, and expeditious retreat) are multiplicative bonuses that base their increase/decrease on the current speed.<br/>\n--<br/>\nWhen a speed increase/decrease is added a recursive formulation follows multiplying first and then re-adding the monk bonus.<br/>\nWhen a speed increase/decrease is removed then the speed is recalculated multiplying first and then adding the monk bonus once thereafter.<br/>\n--<br/>\nThe spells haste, expeditious retreat, and blinding speed try to be mutual exclusive, thus their scripts do not allow for stacking.<br/>\n--<br/>\nThe cap for one with monk speed is (3.0 + monk speed bonus) * base speed. \u00a0Without monk speed the cap is 1.5 * base speed.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n--<br/>\nThus for direct answers. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nPerma-haste does stack with expeditious (though without monk speed either of the two already reaches the cap). \u00a0Just remember to unequip and reequip the perma-haste item whenever you lose a speed affecting effect (this causes the monk speed to be considered multiple times).<br/>\n<br/>\nA monk 6 build with mass haste and expeditious retreat has pretty much reached full potential ((1.2 * 1.5) + 0.2) * 1.5 + 0.2) = 3.2 which is the cap (3.0 + 0.2) for a level 6 monk. \u00a0After that every three monk levels only increases the speed by 0.1 because of the cap. \u00a0Though every 3 levels of monk means 6 less rounds of extended expeditious retreat and extended mass haste.</div></blockquote>\nFurther reading:\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Talk:Monk/Archive_1\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NWN Wiki, Talk:Monk/Archive 1</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"font-size:100%;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Conditions in which taking Monk is less favourable</span></span></strong><br/>\n- non-lawful characters (ie Bards, Barbarians) which would require alignment change to be legal<br/>\n- characters using armor and/or shield. These characters will find the Monk UBAB/Wisdom AC/Monk AC and Monk speed abilities are disabled. The character still gets the other benefits of the Monk class however (including Evasion, Deflect Arrows, +2 to saves against mind affecting spells, Improved Knockdown, Improved Evasion, Diamond Soul etc...)<br/>\n- non-Wisdom focused characters using robes but weapons other than unarmed/Kamas. Such characters will find the Monk UBAB is disabled but all the other benefits of the Monk class are accessible.<br/>\n- arcane spellcasters with low Wisdom scores and low reflex saves, who cannot take advantage of Monk UBAB, Monk Wisdom AC and Evasion. Such characters, providing they are wearing robes, will still benefit from Monk Speed and other benefits of the Monk class. Note that negative Wisdom modifiers do not reduce a characters AC (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Monk_AC_bonus\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Monk_AC_bonus</a>).\u00a0<br/>\n- dexterity based characters without access to Uncanny Dodge (Uncanny Dodge will preserve the Dexterity Bonus to AC, even if flatfooted, and the Monk Class does not provide this)<br/>\n- if there are already three classes in a build, and the builder does not want to lose one of those classes<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"font-size:150%;line-height:normal\">How many levels to take in Monk as a minor class</span></strong><br/>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">A single level of Monk</span></strong><br/>\nOne level of Monk provides enormous value.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIt provides +2 to all saves at the expense of 1 BAB (if taken pre-epic), 7 feats, access to the Monk unarmed base attack bonus (ie up to 6 attacks per round unarmed or with a single Kama, or up to 8 attacks per round with dual Kamas and improved two weapon fighting) and the ability to access the class skills listed above for 'skill dumps' (particularly Tumble, Hide/Move Silently, Listen, Persuade and Discipline).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe benefits from this single level of Monk depends on the playstyle of the character:<br/>\n- if using robes and unarmed/Kamas, then full benefits are obtained<br/>\n- if using robes but other weapons, the Monk unarmed base attack bonus is disabled. Other benefits of the class remain.<br/>\n- if using armor and/or a shield, the Monk unarmed base attack bonus, Monk Wisdom AC bonus are disabled. Other benefits of the class remain.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">More than a single level of Monk</span></strong><br/>\nExtra levels of Monk are also useful depending on what the build requires and how many levels the primary class requires. For example a Paladin build might not want more than 24 levels as this grants access to being undispellable apart from Mord's, and extra levels in other classes may be more beneficial than advancing Paladin further.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nFurther sweet spots to stop taking Monk in designing builds are (and these are not 'hard and fast' rules):\u00a0<br/>\n- 3 monk levels (for deflect arrows, +10% speed and +2 to saves against mind affecting spells),\u00a0<br/>\n- 6 monk levels (for +1 Monk AC, +20% speed, knockdown and improved knockdown),\u00a0<br/>\n- 9 monk levels (for +30% Monk speed and improved evasion)\u00a0<br/>\n- 12 monk levels (for diamond soul, +40% monk speed and 1d12 unarmed damage)<br/>\n- 15 monk levels (for quivering palm, +3 Monk AC, +50% Monk speed)<br/>\n- 16 monk levels (for ki strike +3, 1d20 unarmed damage)<br/>\n- 18 monk levels (for empty body, Monk speed +60%)\u00a0<br/>\n- 20 monk levels (for perfect self, +4 Monk AC) - such characters are essentially primary Monks however<br/>\n<br/>\nI mention these are not 'hard and fast', as Monk provides access to Tumble, Listen and Discipline as class skills. This means further levels can be used for skill dumps.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, a character may want to take Monk 6 to access Improved Knockdown in a build that otherwise would not have access to Tumble as a class skill. For playability the 6th level of Monk might be taken mid way through the build.

I've also tested it in game. Thank you so much for pointing this out. I learnt a lot about speed casting mechanics going through it. Its actually a lot simpler than I thought it would be.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've fixed the typo in the BAB table.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI've added a link to the Order of Jorumndgandr written by KailPendragon.

I agree with your class split to recommend two levels of Monk. Taking an early Monk level (rather than at 37) allows the character to play more of the game with polymorph forms with Monk abilities, rather than having to wait until level 39 (which is what Kail wrote).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
