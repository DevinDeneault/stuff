      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">There has been much debate over this, especially if you go back to the old forums. <br/>\nA strength build with a strength of 30 has a +10 modifier. A dexterity build would need the ESF feat to get approximately the same modifier. The same goes for any build based on other abilities.<br/>\nSince the Attack roll against you is the DC, you must compare your skill with your AC and see if the skill is worth taking at all. In high magic environments, the different sources of AC (Deflection, Natural...etc) add far more to AC than what is possible to add to AB, and you may end up with a \"battle of 20s\" where you only hit on a 20 roll, and it becomes impossible to spam Knockdowns. But even before that the AC will \"outclass\" the Discipline check.<br/>\nIn the case of dexterity builds, it is often easier to get a higher AC than what you get with a strength build. Dexterity builds also often have Epic dodge, that avoids the first melee attack in the round. That attack is also likely to have the highest AB. For these reasons many/most dex builds don't take Discipline at all, even if it is a class skill.<br/>\nBut to get the exact answer, you must know what you are up against and look at the numbers.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

So to summarise, in high Magic environments<br/>\n- your AC is going to likely be so much higher (at least 20) than attack rolls, especially for dexterity builds, that any knockdown attempt will fail 95% of the time by missing you anyway, and this is because AC has more than 6 potential sources (Deflection, Natural, Armor, Shield, Dodge, other such as dexterity/monk AC/monk wisdom/draconic armor/armor skin etc...) whereas there are much more limited sources of attack bonus. ie how is a +6 melee weapon going to hit an opponent with +6 deflection +6 natural, +6 armor +6 shield +6 dodge and other bonuses (ie +6 attack weapon vs cumulative more than +30 AC bonus already)<br/>\n- there will be knockdown immunity gear available meaning you could use this instead of investing 43 points +/- a feat into discipline<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I take it ESF:Discipline is only useful if you:<br/>\n- have enemies with knockdown or disarm\u00a0<br/>\n- you have low AC meaning the enemy can hit you (ie in a low magic environment)<br/>\n- there are no knockdown immune boots<br/>\n- you aren't playing a super high strength hero such as a RDD with multiple Great Strength levels with maxed discipline skill<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
