I could go for either 1Hander with board but think maybe a 2Hander would be more deadly. I play for lvl 40 builds so playability does mean much to me.<br/>\n @Valefor, I could not find anything on the stacking or not stacking of the Rages bonuses. I will try to find a DM to talk to. This the only thing I could find on Rages,<strong>Barbarian Rages:</strong> The stat bonuses of their rages are removed and replaced with equivilent ab/saves/hp/discipline. (Standard = +2, Greater = +3, Mighty = +4) So by that I am thinking it doesnt stack, but I will try to find out for sure. Once again thanks for your time.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Just a couple of pointers on why I chose the things this way:<br/>\n<br/>\n CHA 16 was picked for 3 reasons: 1- You spend a very long time without an Intimidate dump, so the positive CHA score allows you to compensate for that. 2- You can now equip CHA gear and get an IMPRESSIVE 65 DC to your Terrifying Rage. This is the HIGHEST DC I have EVER SEEN! 3- You will also have access to Divine Wrath, which will add +7 to your AB and Damage for 9 Rounds. Also, it'll cap your saves for that period. If you get some STR enhancements, this guy will be AMAZING when fully buffed.<br/>\n<br/>\n I took Combat feats in Epic levels with CoT bonus feats, and I chose to forego Listen for Spot. You can use the Taunt / Expertise combo to level up easily through the first few levels, and you'll have plenty of combat prowess to back it up. Huge fort save, if you can get some CON gear, it'd be amazing.<br/>\n<br/>\n Whatever you do, don't change the pre-epic spread, as it was done this way to assure Terrifying Rage at level 24. You can alter the order, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div>"

No shield for this guy can be painful, but once a day you'll have 9 rounds of godliness. No meleers can resist your fear, I think even Pally / BGs will have trouble. Only immunity can help them. However, in a battle against other Terrifying Rager, whoever gets the rage out first will win, as you'll likely not be able to make the save either.

      "content": "<div>Hey Theo!<br/>\n<br/>\n Nice catch on Slippery Mind! You'll practically nullify the chances of autofailing with it! Good thinking!<br/>\n<br/>\n I agree, my guy is better at level 40, but I also think he's better from 22 on. At 22 he gets on par with Grizz's in Tumble AC, but he has higher BAB, higher saves, more combat feats, higher STR, etc... Grizz's build is easier to play from 1-22, but is it really THAT much more playable? Look below!\u00a0That said,\u00a0I have leveled a Wizard 29 PM 10 Assassin 1 with ZERO Tumble dumps all the way to 37\u00a0on WoG, I've also leveled my HOOD build (Barbarian 28 / Bard\u00a02 / RDD 10)\u00a0there; the first dump\u00a0was at 21\u00a0and he's now level 37. My Valen Shadowbreath build (Fighter 12 / Blackguard 25 / Bard 3)\u00a0is now level 14 (Fighter 7 / Blackguard 7) without a single Tumble dump and he's doing just fine! Mind you that WoG is one of the hardest servers out there, for sure!<br/>\n<br/>\n Of course it's nice to have Tumble and especially UMD from the start, but let us sit back and compare for a bit, shall we? My build ACTUALLY has a higher AC than Grizz's from level 1 due to Expertise. Here's how: I USE THE TAUNT / EXPERTISE COMBO! Dude, this combo is SOOOOOO POWERFUL! And TBH, nobody seems to use it! It's mind-boggling. Read my Playing Better guide and you'll see how it's done. If you look at the level-by level, you'll only get +4 Tumble AC at level 17, so all the way through pre-epics my build will have higher AC from Expertise. Thanks to Taunt, he can have that +5 AC for FREE (and it works both ways! You can have more AC while Taunting, and then choose how you want to fight: with +5 AC and +1 AB or +6 AB for a more offensive approach). Grizz's build would have to Taunt without Expertise on, so it'd get hit more often than mine for the duration of the Taunt. Once he is done, he'll only have the option of fighting with +6 AB, which means despite the Tumble AC, he'll get hit more often than mine.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, the playability increase really comes from UMD. In my playing experience, you're pretty broke for the first 20 levels of the build, which means you can't go out buying all kinds of scrolls / wands for your toon to use with UMD. I generally can't afford wands until level 30 or so on WoG. Sure, you can use some cheap tactics like buying high-level summon scrolls and using them in areas that you wouldn't be able to clear alone, but this guy doesn't need those tactics for most areas. My point is, there is a slight playability difference, but it's not as high as you may think from just looking at the numbers.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

I believe the worlds you play in must be extremely easy, which would absolutely ruin the use of Taunt, as you'd kill anything in the time it takes to Taunt it. However, if you ever decide to play in a more competitive setting, you'll need a wider bag of tricks. I can relate to what you say when you \"feel\" that you don't need it, I too didn't EVER use Taunt before I started playing on WoG. The thing is, if you play on a server like WoG, where at level 15 (when your AC is in the mid 30s at best) you'll be facing a\u00a0semi-boss\u00a0that has 27 AB and one-hand wields a Greatsword +3 (crits you for\u00a0about 60 damage), regenerates HP and only dies from Fire or Acid damage, you might change your mind. If you're not getting hit, why bother, right? But when EVERYONE you face can hit your pathetic AC without Expertise, Healing Potions are not in abundance, you can only rest every 8 hours and only in a few designated areas, and bosses are 10x tougher than mobs, you'll die so much that you'll eventually realize that you need to become a better player to face these challenges. Right-clicking is no longer enough. I speak from experience, as that's EXACTLY what happened to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n Why don't you start a toon on WoG? It'll be an eye-opener for you. I'll happily show you around.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div>\n</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">I've never played on a persistent world - how do I find it?</div>\n</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">You open the game normally, go to Multiplayer, then click on Join Internet Game, then Direct Connect and paste this IP address: 74.139.199.122<br/>\n<br/>\n The forums are located here: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://worldofgreyhawk.fr.yuku.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WoG Forums</a><br/>\n<br/>\n In the forums you'll find the patches that you need to download to play there. Let me know if you have any questions. You're gonna love it!<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div></div>"
