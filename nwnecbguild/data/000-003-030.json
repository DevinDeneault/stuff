But it can be a melee too, a a Monk? <br/>\n<br/>\nTo be honest we are open for any suggestions!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Alright Oscar, based on the little you have told me,<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the most successful characters and relatively easy to level is a (FTR/ BARD/ RDD), very solid warrior with huge strength, lots of combat feats, several immunities and high AC. If the server supports Devastating Critical then you can have that too with a powerful DC for it, as well. There are simply no downsides with this build, except if you count the ugly wings on your back (especially if you are a Dwarf, ugh). A fine companion for that character (and for any melee toon as well), would be a Sorcerer or an Arcane Archer that \"shoots\" spells or arrows with deadly precision behind him and in the case of Sorcerer, buff him/her as well. A Cleric would be fine too. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother possibility and if you want something more \"classic\" would be a Dwarven Defender coupled with one of the above \"support\" classes. If your server has several tough traps &amp; locks then you might consider a Rogue/ Fighter/ Shadowdancer as well for support with UMD to cover any missing buffs if scrolls available.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
