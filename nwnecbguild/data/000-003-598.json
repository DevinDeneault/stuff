Your basic problem with a Dwarf Paladin is the CHA penalty our bearded friends suffer from, so you run the risk of spreading your stats miserably thin if you want to make good use of Pally-specific attributes. Have you considered maybe a Dwarven Defender/ Fighter/ WM or a Fighter/ CoT/ WM? The first would be horribly feat starved - though not impossible, but the second should be worth a look I'd think.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That Harvester of Souls looks pretty wicked with 48 AB (effective AB 54 with taunt/expertise combo), x5 crit modifier, improved threat range from WM if you want human, scythe, paladin and weaponmaster all in one go, no need to worry with spellcasting either! Maybe that will suit your needs better than my not fully playtested build draft\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
