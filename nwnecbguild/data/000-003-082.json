      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Greetings y'all,<br/>\n<br/>\n I've been messing around with NWN for a while after missing it oh so many moons ago when it first came out. I've played with the OC and the expansions, as well as multiple modules. I've been looking at the boards for interesting builds, and been messing around with various classes. I'm discovering that I'm a huge fan of the Bard, and just a bit less so the Paladin/Cleric (buffing is weirdly fun). But I really want to play a character that swings around a giant sword instead of using a shield and whatever, which is what I've been mostly doing up to this point. So, I decided to build my own Bard that's a Greatsword wielder.<br/>\n<br/>\n Most of the builds I've found involving the Bard are buffer/support, (I really want to try out that Spirit and Steel someday), or take minimal to get RDD into the build. There are also a couple of builds that are doing what I'm doing, but with emphasis in different places. I do totally to taking RDD myself for the STR bonuses.<br/>\n<br/>\n That all said, this is my first build I'm doing that's just not a tweak off of someone else's, so lets see if I'm doing this correctly, and I'll talk about it down below.<br/>\n<br/>\n Bard(24), Fighter(6), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Human<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 16 (38)<br/>\n DEX: 8<br/>\n CON: 15 (18)<br/>\n WIS: 8<br/>\n INT: 14 (16)<br/>\n CHA: 14 (16)<br/>\n<br/>\n Human: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n 01:Bard(1):Blind Fight,Expertise, {Bard Song, Bardic Knowledge}<br/>\n 02:Fighter(1):Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br/>\n 03:Bard(2):Extend Spell<br/>\n 04:Fighter(2):STR+1,Knockdown, (STR=17<br/>\n 05:Fighter(3<br/>\n 06:Fighter(4):Improved Expertise, Weapon Specialization: Greatsword<br/>\n 07:Bard(3)<br/>\n 08:Bard(4):STR+1,(STR=18<br/>\n 09:Bard(5):Curse Song<br/>\n 10:Bard(6)<br/>\n 11:Red Dragon Disciple(1):{Draconic Armor}<br/>\n 12:Bard(7):STR+1,Improved Critical: Greatsword, (STR=19)<br/>\n 13:Red Dragon Disciple(2):{Draconic Abilities}, (STR=21)<br/>\n 14:Red Dragon Disciple(3):{Dragon Breath}<br/>\n 15:Red Dragon Disciple(4):Improved Knockdown, (STR=23)<br/>\n 16:Red Dragon Disciple(5):STR+1,(STR=24)<br/>\n 17:Bard(8)<br/>\n 18:Red Dragon Disciple(6):Toughness<br/>\n 19:Red Dragon Disciple(7):(CON=17)<br/>\n 20:Red Dragon Disciple(8):STR+1,(STR=25)<br/>\n 21:Red Dragon Disciple(9):Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword, {Wings}, (INT=16)<br/>\n 22:Red Dragon Disciple(10):{Darkvision, Draconic Immunity: Fire, Draconic Immunity: Paralysis, Sleeplessness}, (STR=29), (CHA=16)<br/>\n 23:Fighter(5)<br/>\n 24:Fighter(6):STR+1,Armor Skin, Epic Weapon Specialization: Greatsword, (STR=30)<br/>\n 25:Bard(9)<br/>\n 26:Bard(10)<br/>\n 27:Bard(11):Great Strength I, (STR=31)<br/>\n 28:Bard(12):STR+1,(STR=32)<br/>\n 29:Bard(13)<br/>\n 30:Bard(14):Great Strength II, (STR=33)<br/>\n 31:Bard(15)<br/>\n 32:Bard(16):STR+1,(STR=34)<br/>\n 33:Bard(17):Great Strength III, (STR=35)<br/>\n 34:Bard(18)<br/>\n 35:Bard(19)<br/>\n 36:Bard(20):STR+1,Great Strength IV, (STR=37)<br/>\n 37:Bard(21)<br/>\n 38:Bard(22)<br/>\n 39:Bard(23):Great Constitution I, Lasting Inspiration, (CON=18)<br/>\n 40:Bard(24):STR+1,(STR=38)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 488<br/>\n Skillpoints: 288<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 26/22/18<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9<br/>\n BAB: 26<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 43 (melee), 25 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 23/34<br/>\n Spell Casting: Bard(6)<br/>\n Alignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\n Discipline 43(57), Lore 8(35), Perform 42(45), Spellcraft 42(45), Taunt 43(46), Tumble 40(39), UMD 37(40), remaining skillpoints 33<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Discipline(4), Lore(4), Perform(1), Spellcraft(3), Taunt(4), UMD(3), Save(9),<br/>\n 02: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Save(12),<br/>\n 03: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Perform(3), Taunt(2), Tumble(5), Save(7),<br/>\n 04: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Save(10),<br/>\n 05: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Save(13),<br/>\n 06: Discipline(1), Save(17),<br/>\n 07: Discipline(1), Perform(3), Spellcraft(5), Taunt(4), Tumble(5), UMD(5), Save(1),<br/>\n 08: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(6),<br/>\n 09: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(11),<br/>\n 10: Discipline(1), Perform(3), Spellcraft(5), Taunt(1), UMD(5), Save(3),<br/>\n 11: Discipline(1), Save(7),<br/>\n 12: Discipline(1), Taunt(2), Tumble(5), Save(6),<br/>\n 13: Discipline(1), Save(10),<br/>\n 14: Discipline(1), Save(14),<br/>\n 15: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(5), Save(13),<br/>\n 16: Discipline(1), Save(17),<br/>\n 17: Discipline(1), Perform(3), Taunt(5), Tumble(5), UMD(5), Save(5),<br/>\n 18: Discipline(1), Save(9),<br/>\n 19: Discipline(1), Save(13),<br/>\n 20: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(5), Save(12),<br/>\n 21: Discipline(1), Save(16),<br/>\n 22: Discipline(1), Save(21),<br/>\n 23: Discipline(1), Save(26),<br/>\n 24: Discipline(1), Save(31),<br/>\n 25:Discipline(1),Spellcraft(4),Taunt(8),Tumble(5),UMD(9),Save(12),\u00a0<br/>\n 26:Discipline(1),Taunt(1),Save(18),\u00a0<br/>\n 27:Discipline(1),Perform(2),Taunt(1),Tumble(5),Save(17),\u00a0<br/>\n 28:Discipline(1),Taunt(1),Save(23),\u00a0<br/>\n 29:Discipline(1),Spellcraft(5),Taunt(1),Save(24),\u00a0<br/>\n 30:Discipline(1),Perform(3),Taunt(1),UMD(5),Save(22),\u00a0<br/>\n 31:Discipline(1),Perform(3),Taunt(1),Save(25),\u00a0<br/>\n 32:Discipline(1),Perform(6),Taunt(1),Tumble(5),Save(20),\u00a0<br/>\n 33:Discipline(1),Perform(5),Taunt(1),Save(21),\u00a0<br/>\n 34:Discipline(1),Perform(5),Spellcraft(5),Taunt(1),Save(17),\u00a0<br/>\n 35:Discipline(1),Taunt(1),UMD(5),Save(18),\u00a0<br/>\n 36:Discipline(1),Taunt(1),Save(24),\u00a0<br/>\n 37:Discipline(1),Taunt(1),Tumble(5),Save(25),\u00a0<br/>\n 38:Discipline(1),Taunt(1),Save(31),\u00a0<br/>\n 39:Discipline(1),Perform(5),Spellcraft(5),Taunt(1),Save(27),\u00a0<br/>\n 40:Discipline(1),Taunt(1),Save(33),\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n What do I like about the build:<br/>\n - Lots of HP<br/>\n - Good AC for a two-hander.<br/>\n - Great BAB<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#000000\">- Lots of Bard Levels for bard spells, bard/curse song, taunt, tumble, etc.</span><br/>\n - About the best damage I can do for a Greatsword using Bard as a main class.<br/>\n - Expertise for trading AB for AC.<br/>\n - Imp Knockdown<br/>\n - It's actually playable from 1.<br/>\n<br/>\n What do I not like about the build:<br/>\n - Lots of extra skill points left over - what do I do with them? Persuade for modules that want it. Open lock, search, I guess?<br/>\n - Extend spell is not useful yet where I take it, but there's no other place to slot it (I guess you could swap with Curse Song)<br/>\n<br/>\n Notes:<br/>\n - I also came up with an idea for a version where you take 2 less Int, get RDD earlier, still get expertise/improved, and add one more point to Con. However, I lost Extend Spell, and low level Bardness. I didn't like that.<br/>\n - I could also push off more RDD into Epic levels, take more Bard earlier. That doesn't modify when you get abilities nor does it hurt skill points any.<br/>\n - My goal was NOT Dev Crit<br/>\n - Bard up to 16 of course is optimal. Up to 20 is fine to get more spell slots, which I want. However I'm not completely sold on Bard 21-24 yet. I don't know what I would replace it with, though. I could do 2 more Fighter levels and get Epic Prowess? Am I missing anything else?<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyways, I'm posting this:<br/>\n A) to make sure I'm doing this right and\u00a0<br/>\n B) to get holes poked in my build.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

And what a solid build it is!<br/>\n I Like what you did there, and I agree with you that Bard 21-24 is questionable. Well, Bard 24 does make your buffs undispellable by everything except Mord's, but the qustion is whether you want to give it up for something else. 20/10/10 gives you an extra feat, which you can use to get Epic Prowess. I'm also not sure about the Great Constitution feat at the end in this build of yours. I'd probably just end with 15 CON and swap it for Epic Prowess anyway. If you cast Endurance on yourself and get an odd score, it'll be more often than not the same as getting an even score with the even number, but the benefit of Epic Prowess is there all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n I do have one thing to say. Maybe this particular class split is not the best for wielding a Greatsword in a competitive environment. If you play the OC, you can play Mick's Epic Scholar build and it'll work, but anywhere where the monsters have even decent AB, your guy will struggle. For this purpose, I do recommend my <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2330742/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cursed Half-Dragon Chanter</a> build, which you can find in the level 40 section.<br/>\n<br/>\n Skill-wise, I recommend adding either Listen or Spot to be able to see hidden creatures (Listen is better cuz it goes through walls). <br/>\n<br/>\n Also, to play this build properly, I recommend you learn the Taunt / Expertise combo, which can be found in the Game Guides Section, Paying Better guide!<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers and Congrats!<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>edit: 20170307 per Hip; linked build ref</em><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I appreciate your feedback! My first change is that yes, changing it to a 20/10/10 split makes more sense for the goal of this build. This allows me to add Armor Skin and Epic Prowess while adding more Great Strengths (str up to 40, nifty!) However, the tradeoff is that I lose Lasting Inspiration.<br/>\n<br/>\n So I now have a different level split - I went and did another search to see if that split existed and I found a couple of builds in the old archive, Singing meleer, and Eversinging Dragonbard. The former, while older and not with a good level schedule, has the interesting idea of pumping con so that you can take damage reduction. That's a good alternate strategy, but I'm going for max AB. The latter is quite similiar expect in what feats are taken (I specifically desired Imp Knockdown/Expertise.) The latter also links to a bunch of similar, most of which I've looked already but are worth discussing. The level splits range from 16 bard to 24 bard (With the balance in fighter) and vary mostly on the feats taken. Half or more are focusing on Dev Crit, which I'm not; that's a completely different feat selection. Some have some Epic skill focus, some are greatsword, some are scimitar builds.<br/>\n<br/>\n So I guess this build remains somewhat interesting, in the feat selection at least though certainly not in the class selection. Maximize AB first, Maximize AC next, then get whatever else you need along with it. Also, the weapon can really be whatever you want it to be (including exotic if you drop blind fight or extend spell). But the improved expertise kinda yells out 2-hander to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n I took a look at the Cursed Half-Dragon Chanter, and I see it uses Pale Master, I totally see what you're doing there. I've not played with that yet, so I'm unfamiliar with what it adds, but after checking it out, yeah. Defense galore! But it is non good which, I guess I have RP reasons to like Good.<br/>\n<br/>\n So without further ado, lets try this again:<br/>\n<br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\n<br/>\n Bard(20), Fighter(10), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Human<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 16 (40)<br/>\n DEX: 8<br/>\n CON: 15 (17)<br/>\n WIS: 8<br/>\n INT: 14 (16)<br/>\n CHA: 14 (16)<br/>\n<br/>\n Human: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n 01: Bard(1): Blind Fight, Expertise<br/>\n 02: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br/>\n 03: Bard(2): Extend Spell<br/>\n 04: Fighter(2): STR+1, Knockdown, (STR=17)<br/>\n 05: Bard(3)<br/>\n 06: Bard(4): Curse Song<br/>\n 07: Bard(5)<br/>\n 08: Fighter(3): STR+1, (STR=18)<br/>\n 09: Fighter(4): Improved Expertise, Weapon Specialization: Greatsword<br/>\n 10: Bard(6)<br/>\n 11: Red Dragon Disciple(1)<br/>\n 12: Bard(7): STR+1, Improved Critical: Greatsword, (STR=19)<br/>\n 13: Red Dragon Disciple(2): (STR=21)<br/>\n 14: Red Dragon Disciple(3)<br/>\n 15: Red Dragon Disciple(4): Improved Knockdown, (STR=23)<br/>\n 16: Red Dragon Disciple(5): STR+1, (STR=24)<br/>\n 17: Bard(8)<br/>\n 18: Red Dragon Disciple(6): Toughness<br/>\n 19: Red Dragon Disciple(7): (CON=17)<br/>\n 20: Red Dragon Disciple(8): STR+1, (STR=25)<br/>\n 21: Red Dragon Disciple(9): Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword, (INT=16)<br/>\n 22: Red Dragon Disciple(10): {Darkvision}, (STR=29), (CHA=16)<br/>\n 23: Fighter(5)<br/>\n 24: Fighter(6): STR+1, Great Strength I, Epic Weapon Specialization: Greatsword, (STR=31)<br/>\n 25: Bard(9)<br/>\n 26: Bard(10)<br/>\n 27: Bard(11): Great Strength II, (STR=32)<br/>\n 28: Bard(12): STR+1, (STR=33)<br/>\n 29: Bard(13)<br/>\n 30: Bard(14): Great Strength III, (STR=34)<br/>\n 31: Bard(15)<br/>\n 32: Bard(16): STR+1, (STR=35)<br/>\n 33: Fighter(7): Great Strength IV, (STR=36)<br/>\n 34: Fighter(8): Armor Skin<br/>\n 35: Fighter(9)<br/>\n 36: Fighter(10): STR+1, Great Strength V, Epic Prowess, (STR=38)<br/>\n 37: Bard(17)<br/>\n 38: Bard(18)<br/>\n 39: Bard(19): Great Strength VI, (STR=39)<br/>\n 40: Bard(20): STR+1, (STR=40)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 464<br/>\n Skillpoints: 280<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 25/22/18<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses:\u00a0<br/>\n BAB: 26<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 45 (melee), 26 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 23/34<br/>\n Spell Casting: Bard(6)<br/>\n Alignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n AB is 45 + 2 (Bulls Str) + 2 (War Cry) + 2(Bard Song) + 5 (GMW) = 56, + curse song and taunt = 67 potentially.<br/>\n AC is 40 + 5 (bard song) + 4 (haste) + 8 (full plate) = 57 + 10 Imp Ext = 67, + 2 more for curse song = 69.<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I wanted to get Bard to 20 because of using spells. However I can see now that with the goal of my build that is likely unreasonable. I'm using Bard Spells for their buffs, not for their offensive capabilities, and level 6 spells offer little in that regard.<br/>\n<br/>\n My intention was to wear full plate, remove armor to buff, and put it back on; not to cast in combat. That's how I've been playing bard up until now (well, with medium armor/shield removing at least.)<br/>\n<br/>\n So that means drop Bard levels down to 16, make the bard a pure singer, and start out with something like 16/12/14/8/14/12.<br/>\n Or it means bring Bard up to 24 levels again to prevent dispelling of buffs. Go ahead and add still spell in there instead of extend spell.<br/>\n<br/>\n So let me ask a question of the masters - is Improved Expertise really at all useful? Admittedly I haven't used it while going through modules before. I was assuming you get yourself a high enough AB, then trade part of it for AC since you lack a shield. I lack the practical experience to tell me if that's a good thing to have or not. I ask because this build is kinda mediated around getting that.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm learning a lot discussing this, this is great, and thanks for talking the weak points out for me.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

With Bard 20 using both songs in parallel each time, that's 50 hrs per day each which means there should never be a moment that your bard (and party within 30 ft and enemies within 30 ft of the curse) is not under its influence.\u00a0 That's HUGE considering all those buffs are unable to be dispelled and will work even in wild magic and null magic zones.\u00a0 And no significant CHA is necessary except to make it slightly easier to reach the Perform requirements for high-level songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nImpExpertise is a \"hit on 20 only\" mode.\u00a0 You'd be using it against a boss who cannot be touched and cannot be critted because the AC is too high so to stand in against such a threat, you raise your AC as high as possible, and hope you can roll enough naturals to land some damage.\u00a0 The thing is, if you are already resigned to hitting only on naturals, you may as well use Improved Power Attack for the additional damage.\u00a0 Against a high AC foe with DR, at least you'll do some damage when the dice finally decide to favor you.\u00a0 Once you've resigned yourself to hitting on 20's only, the builds that will dominate in those instances will always be the ones with the highest APR, like a DWing kama monk.\u00a0 But greatsword is at the other end of the spectrum... average APR with high base damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlain Expertise is different in that successful Taunting can actually <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">increase</span> your AB by 1 with a maximum roll by reducing the enemy AC 1 point more than what Expertise does for your PC.\u00a0 Unfortunately, unless you invest into Epic Taunting, the uber Concentration types that DO invest in the associated counterskill, will make Taunts problematic at best.\u00a0 It's just an opposed skill check with both taunter and concentrator rolling the same d20 which can result in vastly different outcomes for the same Taunt and Concentration skill levels on successive checks.\u00a0 The best ImpExpertise can achieve by taunting is -4AB, i.e. an AB penalty instead of a gain.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlain Expertise is a decent compromise, though, even without being able to Taunt.\u00a0 A Weapon Master usually reaches a high enough AB to be able to relinquish 5 AB occasionally and still hit often enough while gaining some AC in the process.\u00a0 Coincidentally, Expertise is one of the prereq feats for WM that are actually useful, contrary to something like Whirlwind that is buggy at best and instant death at its worst.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bottom line is:\u00a0 if AC is a major concern, build a DEXer, preferably an Epic Dodge one.\u00a0 Then the decision to elect a feat like ImpExpertise will never enter the discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then there is concealment as a way to avoid getting hit.\u00a0 A topic for another time.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I can see how it's not the panacea to a low AC now.<br/>\n<br/>\n I was doing some reading up on improved knockdown as well last night, and I realized the same thing about it. Knockdown, very very useful. Imp Knockdown...not so much unless you want to slam dragons for the fun of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n I can understand why the other builds I saw are built like they are, and not like what I did. This was a good exercise for me though, and I thank you all for your input!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
