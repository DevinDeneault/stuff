Many people assume you need to be wiz/sorc based (and some PWs like Kharlindale require 20 levels of wiz/sorc before taking PM), I was pointing out that there are melee PM tanks that work really well and showing a few successful builds that I know work AND can function well while soloing if need be.  I'll edit the junk at the bottom of my post, must have pasted twice.<br/>\n<br/>\n I agree, adding DWD or barbarian isnt going to get you much in a mage 20 pm 10 type build.<br/>\n<br/>\n More information on the types of world(s) you would use this build on would be helpful (e.g. many builds scale spells beyond caster level 20, some PWs have XP that's hard to come by, so XP penalties hurt more there, etc).  If he's going to solo a lot that would affect the build too.</div>"

Haven't tried to calculate the subrace deal yet.\u00a0 Perhaps after you get closer to an official PM tank, we can begin considering variants.</div>"
