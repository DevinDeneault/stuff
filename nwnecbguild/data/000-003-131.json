discipline.\u00a0 Clc24/Monk8/CoT8 has a lot more potential than Clc28/Mnk12 when you need to bump two different abilities in the same build.\u00a0 Clc24/Mnk6/CoT10 is also very good but deciding when to take your last skill dump can be hard to determine depending on how much you figure on using IKD.\u00a0 Unless there is some server-specific reason for needing more than 6-8 levels of monk?</em><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Well, Diamond Soul is nice with many more monk levels (like around 20 or more) but a cleric's Spell Resistance spell makes DS redundant.\u00a0 Sure, DS cannot be breached, but for a Cleric 24, the SR would be 36 and even breached via Mord it will be 26, still better than a Monk 12's SR 22.\u00a0 And naturally, lesser breaches will have less effect on the buff's stability.<br/>\n<br/>\n As long as that Intuitive Attack uses the DEX modifier to establish AB, then it could work.\u00a0 Otherwise, without Weapon Finesse, your kamas will be using the STR modifier for attack.\u00a0 BTW, you are taking Weapon Finesse w-a-a-a-a-y too late.\u00a0 It should be taken within the first 2 or 3 levels of a melee build else you will be swinging and missing.\u00a0 Your build is suffering from rushing to qualify for WM.\u00a0 In the sample I provided Blind Fight is ridiculously late but such is the problem with a forced fit.\u00a0 But the problem is the same in both cases.\u00a0 You must sacrifice playability all for the sake of crit range and multiplier, which, IMO is really not worth it.\u00a0 There is a reason no one designs this combo after 10+ years of toon building.\u00a0 Wanna guess what that might be?<br/>\n<br/>\n Your ability spread is not optimized.\u00a0 Unless your allotment to charisma is some sort of roleplay gesture, it gimps this build.<br/>\n<br/>\n You can't take ImpCC without CC.\u00a0 However, rather than waste 2 feats just max concentration.\u00a0 That way you need not be concerned about getting taunted either which CC/ImpCC won't help with.\u00a0 Maybe your subrace thingy gives CC for free but even so, there are more important aspects that need addressing than avoiding some AoOs trying to cast within melee range.\u00a0 If you learn to melee within Darkness, your cleric will never be open to AoOs again.\u00a0 Think about it.\u00a0 And I have yet to see Darkness \"molested\" by custom spell alterations.<br/>\n<br/>\n Plan your subrace bonuses to result in EVEN final ability scores.\u00a0 Those trailing (odd) numbers serve no purpose and waste potential.<br/>\n<br/>\n TBH, I would always strive for at least 24 levels of cleric in a caster build rather than those extra monk levels that really serve no purpose other than the high saves the class gets.\u00a0 Without Extended metamagic you are going to need the longest non-meta duration possible and all the slots you can muster as your divine buffs expire in just a couple turns (DivFavor/DivPower/Prayer/Battletide).<br/>\n<br/>\n The advantage of a cleric/monk/CoT is that Great Wisdom becomes available in epic levels as CoT bonus feats.\u00a0 The synergy between cleric and monk benefits from being able to optimize your primary attack ability (in this case, DEX) with the normal bumps while gaining WIS in parallel via CoT.\u00a0 For instance, CoT 10 offers +5 WIS by virtue of bonus as long as they are taken after level 20. The extra WIS affects cleric's spell DC (essentially universal +1 spell focus per each 2 WIS), monk WIS AC, Will saves and bonus slots.\u00a0 The power of this combination is in its wisdom more than any other ability.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
