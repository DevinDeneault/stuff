      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Designed around environments where creatures are given high immunities with relatively few hit dice, this build is designed to deal irresistible damage from a range. If enemies close in, he will have a few melee smites at his side, a powerful lay on hands attack vs. undead, as well as a moderate turning ability for a large assortment of creatures. He can get the vast majority of standard creatures to be turned, but the instant death (for creatures whose hit dice + turn resistance is 14 or lower) is somewhat limited. While taking the cleric level late, certainly maximizes the spellcraft investment, it can be taken earlier especially if this character has need of clerical scrolls or the ability to turn more creatures. Though the blessed bolt is an instant kill for rakshasas, celestial avengers, and hound archons, the crossbow was selected mostly for its critical hit range; focus in the longbow is a viable alternative. This build certainly has problems in PvP (including not being able to remove death ward from shifted rakshasas, and not being able to turn the loyal balor summon); and the AB is certainly lacking for a ranged build, but the many instances where he can turn a creature and then attack it flatfooted, and there is nothing that creature can do about it, ensures that this build is quite valuable to a party, even if his soloing skills are not up to par. This build uses wisdom instead of dexterity for its shooting, which opens up a lot of spell slots in the paladin spell book, allowing for better defenses and refreshing some spells like divine favor and prayer. This build is also heavily feat starved, so it lacks several decent feats like point blank shot and divine shield.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Divine Scout (Paladin 29/ Champion of Torm 10/ Cleric 1)</strong><br/>\n Human, Lawful Good<br/>\n PvM 1-40 (High Magic only, support character)<br/>\n<br/>\n Strength 14<br/>\n Dexterity 8<br/>\n Constitution 10<br/>\n Wisdom 16 (26)<br/>\n Intelligence 10<br/>\n Charisma 16 (26)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 398 (max roll), 276 (average)<br/>\n Skillpoints: 129<br/>\n Saving throws: Fortitude 36, Reflex 30, Will 37 <strong><span style=\"color:#FF0000\">(+8 vs. spells)</span></strong><br/>\n BAB: 30<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"color:#FF0000\">AB, melee: 33 (mundane greatsword)</span></strong><br/>\n AB, <span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>ranged:</strong></span> 41/36/31/26 (naked, unbuffed)<br/>\n AC: <strong><span style=\"color:#FF0000\">13 (naked),</span></strong> 21 (full plate, unbuffed)<br/>\n Damage (mundane crossbow, unbuffed): 1d10<br/>\n Class level for turning: 28 (works on undead, vermin, elementals, and outsiders)<br/>\n Smite bonus damage: 39 x4 = 156<br/>\n<br/>\n Skills:<br/>\n Discipline 43 (45)<br/>\n Persuade 6 (14)<br/>\n Spellcraft 40<br/>\n Tumble 20 (19)<br/>\n<br/>\n Leveling:<br/>\n 1.

Here is the uniqueness factor of the build- it is a high level paladin that has expanded its turn ability to a large variety of creatures, (through a clerical level and planar turning unlocking elementals, vermin, and outsiders) while at the same time retaining most paladin pluses.  I have searched through the builds, and the only ones taking planar turning or even expanding the turn types are high level clerics (over 20+ cleric levels for those with planar turning).  The trick with turning and ranged fighting, is that you can often catch a turned creature flatfooted with a ranged weapon, however if you try to approach them with a melee weapon, they will just run away.  This potentially negates a lot of AC from the target.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext, smiting cannot be done with a ranged weapon, however, due to the charisma and strength buffs, he should have no problem scoring a smite on a few creatures with his greatsword once they come into melee range.  Smiting is simply another feature of the build, potent enough to do serious damage, but not a central focus of the build.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, the 1.69 patch fixed crossbow.  So it is a viable weapon, almost equivalent to the bow.  Rapid shot loses its meaning in an environment with perma-haste, as the extra blow is demoted 5 points, making the attack power worse while in rapid shot mode than not in it.  As this is for high magic environments, the crossbow with rapid reload is still a strong weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for damage, I have already posted this build is for environments with significant damage immunity/reduction.  Physical damage is less of a focus compared to irresistible damage (divine might, divine favor, divine wrath).  Clerical scrolls can also add battletide to the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor listing other builds, given that there is none that synergizes smites and turning so well; I could list all the smite builds, all the ranged divine might builds, and all the heavy cleric turning builds.  But that number is so numerous without one looking all that similar.  If you want similar ending stats you could go <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build234356.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">divine archer</a> but that is more a of spellcasting build due to its heavy focus in cleric.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Fair enough re: the similar builds, as yes there are over 100 of the combo in the ECB with epic Pal/CoT alone! However, just thought to ask if there were any other (like the Divine Archer for e.g.) that go a different route, but that one is cleric heavy and thus more spell/buff focused, I agree. So nice to see a Pal with the turning angle, as many sometimes forget Pals are pretty good at that, too (and where DM/DS comes from!). Said it would be super duper cool to know this, didn't I?  Nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to confused, not at all. Firstly, can smite with your naked fist, with all the benefits applying to same. True, would cause an AoO without monk in the mix and can't holy sword your fist either but if you whittle them down from a distance via ranged, then pull out a melee weapon--any weapon--and there you go. As to the cross-bow, I don't see it fixed in my own testing. In fact, rather than following the ordinary attack progression (X/X-5/X-10) for some reason it's just showing X, X, X. I will test this in the OC and am happy to do so, unless you are saying that my game albeit a clean load with 1.69 is corrupted which I don't believe that it is.   In any event, you'll still want PBS in there, which is a must-have for all ranged. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to PvE, things are a bit different than PvM and PvP, most true (where the E stands for environment meaning saves, immunity and reduction are very important, I agree, and up against some pretty tough undeads as well; and nice to have those saves and Pal immunities when, as a ranged character, things are being tossed at you in the back row as well. Tis good thinking, and nice to see). If you're in an environment where cleric and pal scrolls are available, then I might be inclined to actually drop an AB point and pick up 2 more great smiting instead so as to have GS V instead of GS III (which melee attack runs off STR and CHA not Wis/Zen as you know); this, so that when the Scout is all buffed up with innate casting along with the scrolls you mention can come out to the front in an emergency situation, like a team captain of sorts should the need arise (thus fulfilling a secondary role, and helping out your party). If so, will want to squeeze BF in there as well, letting you fight well against invisible creatures and denying them the bonus they'd otherwise get against you. Not a must for ranged characters but is for those who wish to step into the fray and melee sometimes, and as a Pal you're immune to fear, etc. anyway. That said, heh, if it's turnable ....  On the other hand, since you don't get Planar or access to cleric scrolls, etc. until the end of your career might not be an option, but still something to consider. This, making it a bit more playable, being able to help your party out more which is always good, yes? <br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise, really NIFTY. A smiting ranged Pal with the turning is cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nSmite/Turn/Shoot ON! ~ Tyr<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I am not sure why yours isn't working, if you had rapid reload pre-1.69 you should be showing two attacks per round; but since you only have one I am thinking the rapid reload feat is not recognized.

Yes, that seems to be what was happening, thanks WhiZard. Happy to confirm that I rolled up a fresh character --in the OC proper! --and seems that reload is working--giving the number of attacks based on BAB (and I still do not know why it's not being recognized in my trainer/builder--it is odd, and looks like my weekend is going to involve pouring over some script!). <br/>\n<br/>\nTesting Stuff:<br/>\nAlso found in testing that haste was working, though. For the purpose of testing, namely to test a variety of different things I rolled up a DP Cleric with a BAB 25, X-bow foci with reload, and went zen (no smiting or other Pal goodies, though. Just a test). Test build gave 3 attacks as per that test-build's BAB (x/x-5/x-10). With haste, became X/X-5/X-10/X as, where reload's working. one would expect. Then, when threw DP on for the 4th attack it arrived properly as X+5 / X / X-5 / X+5 (if X is 41, then: 46/41/36/46), and with haste on top of that giving a 5th attack at X, such that haste does seem to be working with reload, at least according to my OC tests. <br/>\n<br/>\nShoot/Smite/Turn Undeads ON~ Tyr<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

However, interestingly, WhiZard has set up the smite attacks to exactly match the same ranged AB (+41).\u00a0 Extra Smiting provides that bonus for three smite attempts per day.<br/>\n<br/>\n What I am wondering is: since the normal greatsword attack is so pedestrian and also since only the smite attack gives the greatsword viability, wouldn't it be better to increase the productivity of the xbow by swapping ImpCrit: Hvy xbow for that single extra point in AB from WF: greatsword?\u00a0 Eliminating it would drop the normal melee AB to +32 and the smite AB to +40. The xbow range would double from 19-20 to 17-20 and I doubt that greatsword will be getting much use outside of the occasional smite anyway.\u00a0 Just a thought.\n<blockquote><div><strong>TyrTemplar wrote:</strong><hr/>\"because archers in general have little damage when they hit (reason why many go Arcane Archer)\"<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n\n Oh... and to correct some misinformation... archers in general do LOTS of damage.\u00a0 Obviously, a dedicated STR fighter that picks up a bow will be a wimp, archer-wise.

Most all archers do plenty of damage even with mundane ammo (that x3 crit on bows is not a mistake) and do it from a distance of relative impunity (no AoO threats).\u00a0 Stick Darkness into the strategy and they become near godly even against turbo-charged monks with injured legs.\u00a0 Nah.\u00a0 You wouldn't make generalizations like this if you built and played them often and in diverse environments.\u00a0 Let us choose not to accentuate damage factors like mighty properties, the ability to toggle between damage types according to enemy resistance/immunity without losing weapon focus in the switch and the fact that +DEX ability boosts appear on more gear than +STR does.
