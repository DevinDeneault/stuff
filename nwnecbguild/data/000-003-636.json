Full lvl 40 build as well.<br/>\nI did consider quivering palm, but I think ultimately it's about posting big numbers right out of the bat.<br/>\nWhether the monk just runs up in plain sight or does it from stealth really makes no difference either and is allowed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do agree that the addition of cha into the mix begins to make things difficult.<br/>\nI was thinking 16 lvls minimum of monk for the 1d20 is a must, then the rest gets interesting as you could go towards buffs, or maybe even barbarian with thundering rage? I just am not certain if you can add massive criticals to gloves as I'm not overly experienced with monks.<br/>\nRelying on crit damage is ok too as it's more going for highest dmg readout we can get.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a pure focus with zero survivability.

It can self-buff to +13 AB, so you will reach the AB cap if the available gloves are +7 AB or above.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I'm understanding the changes correctly, Divine Might lasts for 21 rounds and Divine Wrath has 3 uses per day and a duration of 8 turns (instead of 14 turns). This is a nice improvement to the build and means it will still be useful even after smiting. With the increased duration it's tempting to get Divine Shield too, but this would require lowering your offence slightly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe build is designed to be played as a normal sword and board Paladin up to level 32, when it finally gains access to Monk unarmed APR. If you want to play unarmed from level 1 then the feats will need to be rearranged. You can move the Monk level anywhere from level 21 to 40, it's even possible to move it to pre-epic levels but that wouldn't result in a fully minmaxed build.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe levels and feats can be rearranged depending on what you prioritise, but you can't make many changes to the feat selection if you want a fully minmaxed build. I chose to focus in scimitars for the increased crit range, but any simple or martial melee weapon will work. Even without IC: Scimitar the threat range is larger than your unarmed threat range, and with a keened scimitar there is a significant difference. Knockdown can be swapped for Divine Shield or IPA but personally I'd recommend sticking with KD. You can drop two ability feats and end with 18 STR in order to gain two epic feats, but this won't give you a fully minmaxed build. For example, this would let you pick up Divine Shield and ESF: Discipline.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want more skills (such as Spot or Taunt) you will need to make a more balanced build.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince it's just a rough build I didn't bother with a full skill progression.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nClass: Paladin 29 / Champion Of Torm 10 / Monk 1<br/>\nRace: Human<br/>\nAlignment: Lawful Good<br/>\nPlayability: 32-40 PvM<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 15 (20)<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 8<br/>\nWIS: 14<br/>\nINT: 8<br/>\nCHA: 18 (26)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Paladin(1): Power Attack, Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br/>\n02: Paladin(2)<br/>\n03: Paladin(3): Divine Might<br/>\n04: Paladin(4): CHA+1, (CHA=19)<br/>\n05: Paladin(5)<br/>\n06: Paladin(6): Knockdown<br/>\n07: Paladin(7)<br/>\n08: Paladin(8): CHA+1, (CHA=20)<br/>\n09: Paladin(9): Blind Fight<br/>\n10: Paladin(10)<br/>\n11: Paladin(11)<br/>\n12: Paladin(12): CHA+1, Extra Smiting, (CHA=21)<br/>\n13: Paladin(13)<br/>\n14: Paladin(14)<br/>\n15: Paladin(15): Weapon Focus: Unarmed<br/>\n16: Paladin(16): CHA+1, (CHA=22)<br/>\n17: Paladin(17)<br/>\n18: Paladin(18): Improved Critical: Unarmed<br/>\n19: Paladin(19)<br/>\n20: Champion of Torm(1): CHA+1, (CHA=23)<br/>\n21: Champion of Torm(2): Great Charisma I, Epic Prowess, (CHA=24)<br/>\n22: Champion of Torm(3)<br/>\n23: Champion of Torm(4): Epic Weapon Focus: Unarmed<br/>\n24: Champion of Torm(5): CHA+1, Great Charisma II, (CHA=26)<br/>\n25: Champion of Torm(6): Great Smite I<br/>\n26: Champion of Torm(7)<br/>\n27: Champion of Torm(8): Great Strength I, Great Smite II, (STR=16)<br/>\n28: Champion of Torm(9): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n29: Champion of Torm(10): Great Smite III<br/>\n30: Paladin(20): Great Smite IV<br/>\n31: Paladin(21)<br/>\n32: Monk(1): STR+1, (STR=18)<br/>\n33: Paladin(22): Great Smite V<br/>\n34: Paladin(23): Great Smite VI<br/>\n35: Paladin(24)<br/>\n36: Paladin(25): STR+1, Great Smite VII, (STR=19)<br/>\n37: Paladin(26): Great Smite VIII<br/>\n38: Paladin(27)<br/>\n39: Paladin(28): Great Smite IX<br/>\n40: Paladin(29): STR+1, Great Smite X, (STR=20)<br/>\n<br/>\nDisable Trap 1(0), Discipline 43(48), Open Lock 1(0), Pick Pocket 1(0), Set Trap 1(0), Spellcraft 1(0), Tumble 35(34)<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nNaked Stats<br/>\nHitpoints: 358<br/>\nSkillpoints: 88<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 35/31/30<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses:\u00a0<br/>\nBAB: 30<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 39 (melee), 30 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 18/27<br/>\nSpell Casting: Paladin(4)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nBuffed Stats (Assuming +12 STR, +12 CON, +12 CHA, +5 AB gloves, +5 AC items, and Haste)<br/>\nAB: 30 (BAB) + 11 (STR) + 4 (Feats) + 5 (AB Bonus) + 1 (Aid) + 1 (Bless) + 5 (Divine Favor) + 1 (Prayer) + 5 (Divine Wrath) = +63 (+14 Smite Evil)<br/>\nAC: 10 (Base) - 1 (DEX) + 2 (WIS) + 7 (Tumble) + 20 (AC Bonus) + 4 (Haste) = 42 (+12 with maxed DEX and WIS) (+11 if you decide to add Divine Shield)<br/>\nHP: 398 (Base) + 200 (CON) = 598<br/>\nFortitude: 23 (Base) + 5 (CON) + 14 (CHA) + 5 (CoT Bonus) = 47 (52 with Divine Wrath)<br/>\nReflex: 18 (Base) - 1 (DEX) + 14 (CHA) + 5 (CoT Bonus) = 36\u00a0(41 with Divine Wrath)<br/>\nWill: 16 (Base) + 2 (WIS) + 14 (CHA) + 5 (CoT Bonus) = 37\u00a0(42 with Divine Wrath)<br/>\n<br/>\nSelf-buffed damage: 1d6 + 12 (+429 Smite Evil) Bludgeoning, 19 Divine, 5 Magical (19-20/x2)<br/>\nThe Bludgeoning damage is subject to DI/DR, both the Divine and Magical damage bypass it.<br/>\nMinimum non-Smite damage: 37 (13 Bludgeoning, 19 Divine, 5 Magical)<br/>\nMinimum non-Smite critical: 74 (26 Bludgeoning, 38 Divine, 10 Magical)<br/>\nMinimum Smite Evil damage: 466 (442 Bludgeoning, 19 Divine, 5 Magical)<br/>\nMinimum Smite Evil critical: 932 (884 Bludgeoning, 38 Divine, 10 Magical)</div>"
