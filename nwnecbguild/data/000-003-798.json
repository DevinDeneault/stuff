We're going to try a persistent world this time and decided to do Aerlith (unless someone else has a better suggestion). The new group member suggested we roleplay our characters based on the DnD inspired visual novel Goblin Slayer, but we both are still amateurs at DnD and NWN.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe character I will be playing: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://goblin-slayer.fandom.com/wiki/Priestess\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://goblin-slayer.fandom.com/wiki/Priestess</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHis character: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://goblin-slayer.fandom.com/wiki/Goblin_Slayer\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://goblin-slayer.fandom.com/wiki/Goblin_Slayer</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI personally have not read the novel myself so if there is any additional information required, I will have to ask him on your behalf as he is Japanese and doesn't speak English.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your time!</div>"

As for the actual Goblin Slayer - an adaptation of Mick's Brawler Champion could work, but part of me is leaning towards a Ranger base for Favoured Enemies/BoE. But I'll let you mull it over for a bit...<br/>\nCheers</div>",
