I'd like to get help tweeking it for all its worth<br/>\n<br/>\n Grimnir77's intro:<br/>\n \"My second version of the infamous Battleragers of Faerun, called Kuldjargh's (axe-idiots) by the Dwarves.<br/>\n It's a fitting name, all-out offense, with little thought for defense. Fury fueling their spirit and battle prowess, attacking without regards to own safety, they are battle-hardened and can deal massive damage, but also withstand extreme punishment. Their only mission is to wade into opponents, scaring them witless while hacking them to pieces. If they loose a pint or two of blood, so be it. Their passion is for battle, and that at least, they are good at.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n Barbarian18/Fighter12, Dwarf<br/>\n Alignment, any non-lawful, but the battleragers are mainly CG.<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 16 (23)<br/>\n DEX: 10<br/>\n CON: 20 (21)<br/>\n WIS: 8<br/>\n INT: 10<br/>\n CHA: 6<br/>\n<br/>\n 01:Barb1: Knockdown<br/>\n 02:Barbarian2<br/>\n 03:Barbarian3: Weapon Focus: Greataxe<br/>\n 04:Fighter1: STR+1, Power Attack, (STR=17)<br/>\n 05:Fighter2: Cleave<br/>\n 06:Fighter3: Great Cleave<br/>\n 07:Fighter4: WS: Greataxe<br/>\n 08:Barb4: STR+1, , (STR=18)<br/>\n 09:Barb5: Blind Fighting<br/>\n 10:Barb6<br/>\n 11:Barb7<br/>\n 12:Barb8: STR+1, improved crit:greataxe, (STR=19)<br/>\n 13:Barb9<br/>\n 14:Barb10<br/>\n 15:Barb11: Toughness<br/>\n 16:Barb12: STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n 17:Barb13<br/>\n 18:Barb14: Called Shot<br/>\n 19:Barb15<br/>\n 20:Barb16: CON+1, (CON=21)<br/>\n 21:Fighter5: Epic Damage Reduction I<br/>\n 22:Fighter6: Epic Weapon Focus: Greataxe<br/>\n 23:Fighter7<br/>\n 24:Barb17: STR+1, Terrifying Rage, (STR=21)<br/>\n 25:Fighter8: EWS: Greataxe<br/>\n 26:Fighter9<br/>\n 27:Fighter10: Epic Damage Reduction II, <strong><span style=\"color:#FF0000\">Great</span></strong> Strength 1 (STR=22)<br/>\n 28:Barb18: STR+1, (STR=23)<br/>\n 29:Fighter11<br/>\n 30:Fighter12: Epic Damage Reduction III, Overwhelming Critical:greataxe<br/>\n<br/>\n HP - 450(rolled) 516(max i think) <span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>(516, confirmed}</strong></span><br/>\n DR 12/-<br/>\n<br/>\n Saving throws<br/>\n Fort - 24<br/>\n Reflex - 11<br/>\n Will - 10<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>(+2 saves vs spells)</strong></span><br/>\n<strong><span style=\"color:#FF0000\">Add'l saves: Traps: +4, Poison: +2</span></strong><br/>\n<br/>\n BAB: 25<br/>\n<br/>\n AB normal greataxe: 34<br/>\n damage, normal greataxe: 1d12+15 (19-20/x3)(add 2d6 on crit)<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"color:#FF0000\">AB, ranged: 25</span></strong><br/>\n<br/>\n AC naked/mundane Full plate: 10/18 <strong><span style=\"color:#FF0000\">[(1H wpn) armor/shield: 21]</span></strong><br/>\n<br/>\n Skillpoints: 108<br/>\n Discipline 33<strong><span style=\"color:#FF0000\"> (39)</span></strong><br/>\n Intimidate 25 <strong><span style=\"color:#FF0000\">(23)</span></strong><br/>\n Taunt 31<strong><span style=\"color:#FF0000\"> (29)</span></strong><br/>\n 19 left to put in heal or listen probably.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>Skill Schedule</strong><br/>\n 01: Discipline(4), Intimidate(4), Taunt(4), Save(4)<br/>\n 02: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(5)<br/>\n 03: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(6)<br/>\n 04: Discipline(1), Save(7)<br/>\n 05: Discipline(1), Save(8)<br/>\n 06: Discipline(1), Save(9)<br/>\n 07: Discipline(1), Save(10)<br/>\n 08: Discipline(1), Intimidate(5), Taunt(5), Save(3)<br/>\n 09: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(4)<br/>\n 10: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(5)<br/>\n 11: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(6)<br/>\n 12: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(7)<br/>\n 13: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(8)<br/>\n 14: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(9)<br/>\n 15: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(10)<br/>\n 16: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(11)<br/>\n 17: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(12)<br/>\n 18: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(13)<br/>\n 19: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(14)<br/>\n 20: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(15)<br/>\n 21: Discipline(1), Save(16)<br/>\n 22: Discipline(1), Save(17)<br/>\n 23: Discipline(1), Save(18)<br/>\n 24: Discipline(1), Intimidate(2), Taunt(4), Save(15)<br/>\n 25: Discipline(1), Save(16)<br/>\n 26: Discipline(1), Save(17)<br/>\n 27: Discipline(1), Save(18)<br/>\n 28: Discipline(1), Taunt(4), Save(17)<br/>\n 29: Discipline(1), Save(18)<br/>\n 30: Discipline(1), Remaining ----&gt; 19</span><br/>\n<br/>\n Grimnir77's end comments:<br/>\n \"Let's face it, the AC is crap. You have good hitpoints and DR 12 to help you last long enough for your offensive powers to finish the opposition. Your offensive power is fueled by terrifying Rage, the greataxe and great cleave to kill as quickly as possible.<br/>\n This build reflects the battlerager in a fine way, all-out reckless offensive with little or no defensive capabilities, except your ability to withstand damage.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n so I saw this build and was wanting a build that maxed HP as and damage as much as possible. any tips are welcome, I've been a shadow stalker of the epic builders guild for years having joined before nwn forums died and moved to the failure of a social bioware network and now here which looks good and I'm looking forward to working wonderfully!<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><span style=\"color:#000000\">edit: per Hip 20160616 (corrections/additions of missing info, in</span></em><span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong> red</strong></span><em><span style=\"color:#000000\">)</span></em><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Just sub in CoT for all the fighter levels after 20 and you'll gain the sacred defense saves with the exact same number of feats available.  You'll get Smite Evil &amp; Divine Wrath as well but their usage is rather limited in this situation.  Which reminds me... I'd recommend setting your alignment to CN or True Neutral to avoid smites.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've read about some servers requiring some sort of DM approval for Prestige classes and didn't know if Arelith was one of those.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

At first you get a +8 STR bonus and a moderate DEX penalty (5-6 ish?). Upon a second tick, it goes to a +12 STR bonus and a large DEX penalty (-8-10 ish). How bad the DEX penalty is scales with how drunk you are.<br/>\n2. This DOES count towards the +12 Stat modifier. Meaning while your completely drunk, you won't gain any STR benefits from items, barbarian rage, potions, etc.<br/>\nOther bits of info... -Depending on how drunk you are, you'll also laugh, fall over, or otherwise flatfoot yourself in the middle of combat. It gets worse/more frequent as you get drunker, but it still happens VERY often even when mildly drunk. <br/>\n<br/>\nso ya honestly I'm a bit open to other classes or builds.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">That sounds good, but don't forget to take Epic Weapon Focus at 21 so that you can take Epic Weapon Specialization. The advantage of Bard over Rogue is that Bards, like Barbarians, also get Taunt as a class skill, so you can make that skill keep updated, but Rogue does get Sneak Attack and Evasion. So if you go Rogue, I suggest Barbarian 15 Fighter 10 Rogue 5 or Fighter 12 Rogue 3, depending on how many feats you want on epics. I also advise you to take 15 barb levels as soon as you can to get Greater Rage. You can go Barb 15 Fighter 5 pre-epic not to lose any BAB, but you will need to survive till lvl 22 without Tumble and UMD dumps, which I don't know if is doable where you play. Also I heard Arelith has a restriction of 3 straight levels of a class, otherwise you could go Barb 16 Fighter 12 Bard 2. You can take bard on levels 21, 22 and 23 and then at 30 to round up the build.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
