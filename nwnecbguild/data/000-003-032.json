If you compare him to the characters you are used to play (epic dodging/ dexterity based) he will certainly have less AC even if you go with a good sub-race. This character is best used in a party where you will be the striker and another character will take the point, David.<br/>\n<br/>\nThinking better of it, even a variant with more Monk levels (Monk 25/ Fighter 10/ Weapon Master 25) wouldn't fare much better in that regard, although you will have slightly more AC &amp; SR with it, no, you need something different altogether, something that protects your dexterity armour class as well. What about Monk 25/ Rogue 13/ Weapon's Master 22) instead? Strength/Dexterity based with Epic Dodge &amp; Uncanny Dodge to protect dexterity AC as well. You will need to raise dexterity to 25 in order to gain Epic Dodge and then you put the rest of your points into strength. A good sub-race with bonuses to both will help there but it is not necessary by any means. Going Monk 8/ Rogue 7/ WM 5 pre-epic means you can still get 16 BAB thus having six attacks/seven with flurry/ eight with haste. Monk 9 gets Improved Evasion, Rogue 10 gets you Defensive Roll and the 13th Rogue level will give you Epic Dodge as a bonus feat.</div>"

      "content": "<div>You see now? Just reading some pages further into your server rules opens up new things that one who builds without knowing the new rules could not have known,,, You must always build for the environment you play, especialy if it is one such as yours David with so many alterations from the default rules of NwN. To give you an example, they have greatly increased the usefulness of Circle Kick in your server (+1 attack/round w/unarmed strikes) to the point that now it is a mandatory feat for any Monk character. Also, when you are a Weapon Master you gain huge benefits for Improved Whirlwind Attack (deals 1d10/weapon master lvl extra dmg, hits twice, big circle) so the combination of Weapon's Master plus Epic Dodge plus Improved Whirlwind Attack becomes apparent immediately. Lastly, the Devastating Critical has been changed to your server to instead deal another increase in multiplayer instead (which is good in the case of a very high-magic server where everyone has huge saves, thus making the default Dev. Crit relatively useless).<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be frank, there are so many alterations to the rules that it becomes a headache to try and build something complex like that without knowing all the details. Tell you what, give me the details for a good sub-race (str/dex bonuses) for that character (and any other rules that might be relevant) and we will see what we can do with it.</div>"

Heck, if the major builder's tricks didn't happen mostly at epic levels then 30 or less would be more than enough. What 15 and more years of DM-ing tought me however is that more importantly, the level of magic is what makes or breaks games way more than levels. Ideally you would want just enough magic that melee characters would feel comfortable &amp; exciting to wear it but not too much as the major class abilities become obsolete. And that is a fine line in the sand my friend, a very fine one that is...</div>"
