      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hello,<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm currently playing on a french RP PW called Baldur's Gate Nights. It's still a beta, but I'm quite enthusiastic about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm playing as a monk/fighter and planning to take rogue levels later on. However, the admin wants to modify the module's hak to make taunt a fighter class skill. I figure taunt would be tremendously useful for a low AB toon like this one, so I'm going to reroll the character to take it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so I would like some advice as to how to build him.<br/>\nI've already thought about a build, and would like to know what ecbguilders think about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few informations about the PW to better understand some of the choices I made, and the constraints of this build:<br/>\n<br/>\n-This is a full epic level 40 PW with +6 items. It starts at level 6, but I'm already level 13, and will probably get back the xp I've got now.<br/>\n<br/>\n-There are a few restrictions about multiclassing here: monks, paladins, clerics and druids can't multiclass with other base classes, but only with prestige classes (granted the prestige class doesn't require another base class). There is an exception for monks though: they can also multiclass into fighter and/or rogue. However, monk has to be the first class. You cannot start as a rogue at level 1 and become a monk. Also, you need to have at least 5 levels in each class.<br/>\n<br/>\n-You can't buy scrolls or potions of invisibility, nor scrolls of true seeing, and lots of other scrolls for that matter, from npcs. Thus, stealth skills are very useful here. However, the admin plans to add a few mobs with true seeing.<br/>\n<br/>\n-As said above, the fighter class is going to be modified to have taunt as a class skill<br/>\n<br/>\n-All the classes that gained 2 skillpoints per level, such as fighter, have been modified to give 4 skill points instead.<br/>\n<br/>\n-From a roleplaying point of view, PCs that have less than 10 in any given ability are considered to be extremely handicaped in that particular ability. For example, a PC with less than 10 intelligence would not even be able to make correct sentences, and would sound like the low intelligence PCs from the old fallout games. Since I don't want to roleplay such a handicap, I want to have at least 10 in every ability, even in charisma.<br/>\n<br/>\n-I care more about PvM than PvP, though I may duel other PCs from time to time.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Since the concept of this character is a master monk, I prefer to have at least 20 monk levels for the \"perfect self\" feat. I also want to fight unarmed.<br/>\n<br/>\n-I know this build will have an xp penalty, but I'm willing to endure it. I care more about the end result than the time it takes me to achieve it.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Though I've started as a human, I could also start over as an elf for the extra dexterity. But that's a difficult choice to make in a build with so many interesting class skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I've come up with this build:<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk(21), Fighter(6), Rogue(13), Human<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 10<br/>\nDEX: 16 (28)<br/>\nCON: 12<br/>\nWIS: 14<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 10<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Monk(1): Blind Fight, Expertise<br/>\n02: Fighter(1): Weapon Finesse<br/>\n03: Fighter(2): Weapon Focus: Unarmed, Improved Expertise<br/>\n04: Monk(2): DEX+1 (DEX=17)<br/>\n05: Monk(3)<br/>\n06: Monk(4): Toughness<br/>\n07: Monk(5):<br/>\n08: Monk(6): DEX+1 (DEX=18)<br/>\n09: Monk(7): Called shot<br/>\n10: Monk(8)<br/>\n11: Monk(9)<br/>\n12: Monk(10): Improved critical: Unarmed DEX+1 (DEX=19)<br/>\n13: Monk(11)<br/>\n14: Monk(12)<br/>\n15: Monk(13): Disarm<br/>\n16: Monk(14): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br/>\n17: Monk(15): <br/>\n18: Monk(16): Improved Disarm<br/>\n19: Fighter(3)<br/>\n20: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Unarmed DEX+1, (DEX=21)<br/>\n21: Monk(17): Epic Weapon Focus: Unarmed<br/>\n22: Monk(18)<br/>\n23: Monk(19)<br/>\n24: Fighter(5):\u00a0Epic Weapon Specialization: Unarmed,\u00a0DEX+1 (DEX=22)<br/>\n25: Monk(20)<br/>\n26: Monk(21)<br/>\n27: Rogue(1): Armor Skin<br/>\n28: Rogue(2): DEX+1, (DEX=23)<br/>\n29: Rogue(3)<br/>\n30: Rogue(4): Epic Skill Focus: Taunt<br/>\n31: Rogue(5)<br/>\n32: Rogue(6): DEX+1, (DEX=24)<br/>\n33: Rogue(7): Great Dexterity I (DEX=25)<br/>\n34: Rogue(8)<br/>\n35: Rogue(9)<br/>\n36: Rogue(10): Defensive Roll, Epic Dodge, DEX+1 (DEX=26)<br/>\n37: Rogue(11)<br/>\n38: Rogue(12)<br/>\n39: Rogue(13): Great Dexterity II, Crippling Strike (DEX=27)<br/>\n40: Fighter(6): Epic Prowess, DEX+1, (DEX=28)<br/>\n<br/>\nHP:386<br/>\nSaves (F/R/W): 25/30/23<br/>\nBAB:26<br/>\nAB(max, naked): 39 (melee) 36 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (Naked): 33<br/>\n<br/>\nSKILLS (323)<br/>\n<br/>\nDisable Trap 32(41), Hide 42(51), Taunt 43(53), Move Silently 42(51),<br/>\nSearch 42(44), Set Trap 42(51), Tumble 40(49), UMD 40<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm concerned though about the low AB and the lack of discipline and concentration (the admin plans to add mobs that taunt PCs). I've thought about abandonning either stealth or traps for a more dedicated meleer, maybe an elf to have a little more AB and AC, but these skills add so much that it's very difficult to part with either of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think about it?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Halfling could bring you some great results here - particularly if you're not too concerned with xp penalties.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, I can't recall the exact figures (I'll check them later, if no one else has come back to you), but I'm positive you don't need to take so many points in trapping skills to deal with and set all deadlies, if not epics. Equally, I reckon you're overpowered in Search. If we're lucky, with some astute pruning we should be able to get you a good wallop of Concentration or Listen (I wouldn't worry overmuch about Discipline in a build like this one).<br/>\n<br/>\nThird (ok, so I lied about \"a couple of things\"), I'm sure we can increase the AB by some juggling - and we might well be able to get Epic Dodge in earlier to soothe some of your AC questions - again, afraid I've little time at the moment, but let me mull - unless one of the great and good comes along in the meantime.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally (and I'm assuming you want to employ the Expertise-Taunt trick with the build, hence the inclusion of the two Expertise feats, so I won't be questioning them), several of your feats will require a decent AB to work properly at later levels, which you don't really have at the moment - I'm thinking most particularly about the Disarm feats, but Called Shot comes to mind as well. And perhaps Toughness is vulnerable, too, if something else proves more helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do like the principle behind it, and I'm guessing it would only take a few tweaks to bump it up somewhat.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, have to go now. Be in touch later.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

With the restrictions you have set upon yourself, can't get much more out of it anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn AB of 39 is enough for a Monk's attack progression and a role-playing character in general. Plus, you have a high \"Taunt\" skill for tough opponents, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want Concentration or Discipline (first will be more useful given your high armour class) then you can reduce \"Set Traps\" to 6 (15) and UMD to 35 (35). That will give you 41 skill points which you can spend there instead. I doubt UMD more than 35 will be necessary in a medium-magic PW anyway.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I've been considering replacing them myself for dodge and maybe some saving throw increasing feats. I don't think replacing toughness would be a good choice though. This character doesn't have that many hitpoints for a meleer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em class=\"mention\">@Valerfor</em> <br/>\nReducing set traps to 6 (15), that would mean that I only get to set deadly traps, and only when not in combat. But I suppose I have to sacrifice something at some point. Perhaps skill mastery would be a better investment than crippling strike?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne alternative I've thought about is sacrificing epic skill focus: taunt to get one more great dexterity, allowing me to start with only 15 dexterity, dropping constitution to 10, and increasing intelligence to 16 for the skill points for concentration, but that might be too heavy of a price to pay for one more skill, especially since I would only have 43 points in taunt then, and I don't know yet how much will be needed. For now, I've been facing only low concentration mobs, but that might change when the module is completed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've tried searching for the build you're talking about, but I can't seem to find it.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

As you and Stagmeister both pointed out, discipline isn't that great for this build given the high AC, epic dodge, and low strength. And while concentration might prove useful later against some mobs, I think being able to set epic traps outside of combat, and deadly traps while in combat will probably be more useful in general. And if I ever have to duel a dedicated PC taunter, his skill is probably going to be too high for me to have reasonable chances to resist even with a maxxed concentration anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do need to rearrange my skill points a bit, as I have noticed that I have more points in set traps than needed for epic traps, but not enough disable traps to actually recover epic traps! I also forgot to take synergy bonuses from disable traps and set traps into account.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in the end, his skills should look like that:<br/>\n<br/>\nSKILLS (323)<br/>\n<br/>\nDisable Trap 37(48), Hide 42(51), Taunt 43(53), Move Silently 42(51),<br/>\nSearch 40(42), Set Trap 37(48), Tumble 40(49), UMD 35, Spellcraft 3 (5)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think, as Stagmeister said, that I should ditch called shot and the disarm feats for something else?

So I'll lower my set traps skill to 34(45), increase my disable traps skill to 40(44), and use intelligence increasing gear to make up for the 4 missing skill points to recover the traps.

And you're right, of course,\u00a0 your build is more \"roguey\", while mine is more \"monky\". And again, play-style is a personal factor when it comes to things like Spot and Listen, Discipline and Concentration (although the environment in which you're playing also factors in there - if enemies don't taunt, leave Conc at home with its knitting), and so on. I'm still learning lots, which is one of the reasons all the builds I post always include full disclosure of the discussions that led to the final version.<br/>\n<br/>\nTalking of which, after you've given your build a good testing, why not post it in the Full Epic sub-forum? It just seems to me that we get a lot of great builds constructed here in the Unfinalized Builds/Build Requests arena that never seem to make it into the pantheon. It doesn't have to be the best of the best ('cos there ain't no such thing anyway), but I'd guess that the Full Epic one is where people will look for builds first - and it's certainly what the Guild Filter spreadsheet uses.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, I digress.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Well the thing is, this build was made with some specific modifications in mind (mainly taunt as a fighter class skill), so it would have to be modified for vanilla NWN.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, you'd have 3 choices:<br/>\n1. Keeping the fighter levels and ditching taunt (and thus the epic skill focus and probably also the expertise feats)<br/>\n2. Replacing the fighter levels by blackguard or paladin levels (the former comes with no xp penalty), giving up WS and EWS+ 2 pre-epic feats<br/>\n3. Keeping the fighter levels, and cross-classing taunt; but obviously it will only be effective if you're facing mostly low concentration ennemies.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, without the rules of this specific PW, you'd want to start as a rogue of course, for more skillpoints. But since fighters, paladins and blackguards in vanilla NWN only gain 2 skillpoints per level, you'd still end up with exactly the same amount of skillpoints.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'm thinking that I'd probably replace called shot by great fortitude , and two great dexterity by epic fortitude and epic skill focus: discipline, to resist dev crits and knockdowns.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I'd also give him a 14 in wisdom instead of strength. It seems to me that it's difficult to have enough AC for duels with high AB characters such as clerics and weapon masters.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
