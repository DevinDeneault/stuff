One needs to build an excel sheet and run the numbers (and formulas). This is something I did for kamas vs unarmed in a monk build for example, which shows that in a mid magic environment with +5 enhancements and extra elemental damage (and without a further extra damage property for gloves to compensate for the fact they get a simple AB enhancement vs an attack (AB+damage) one of ordinary melee weapons) kama generally gives a higher damage output but vs one specific AB-AC value IIRC (might be 2 values).<br/>\n<blockquote><div>But before someone tries to calculate this, I just want to say that even a single kama looks far better than I had thought in comparison with \"the mighty\" greatsword.</div></blockquote>Without having run the numbers, that should generally be true. It's difficult to give up kama in a monk build on the basis of running the damage output per round numbers, but that cannot be the only factor to consider. One should go for what one likes best, even on the basis of simple \"stylish\" preferences. A greatsword wielding monk can be cool.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>AC in robes can be quite ok if you start out with dex 14 and wis 14 (rather than 13 and 8) and can buff them, at least with potions and have access to some dex/wis items. A fighter/monk/wm will not have uncanny dodge though.</div></blockquote>The 14/14 ability spread will come at the expense of something else: what will it be, int, con or str? (in my builds I went for 15/8 in one case, because of dual wielding requirements and 14/14 in the other) AC can be improved but at a cost, as usual. Also, those buffs you \"plan\" upon are of an easily dispellable nature and they would apply also to another monkish build with a higher starting AC; what I mean, is that you are \"lagging\" behind AC wise because of the class spread, fundamentally, if going for robes. If not going for robes, then I'd say there are better choices than monk for a greatsword dev critter since you lose a lot of monk boni for going armored and not unarmed/kama. FTR/Rogue/WM, as uninventive as it sounds, would be a better way to get your dev critting greatsword build.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Here's one that is over on the other side of the spectrum w/higher AC.  Much reduced AB but with monk progression most attacks will begin to coincide with a greatsword version like you are considering (haven't tested this but I think it gets the full 10 APR when flurried).  I don't like any melee fighter without Blind Fight so passed up Toughness.  Also, you could gain Toughness back in epic by going with Ftr 14/Monk 19 but lose 1 AC and a few saves.  I don't know what other feat in epic that would be all that useful TBH.  You could shift 2 start pts from WIS to CON and then with Toughness (by virtue of Mnk 19/Ftr 14) end up with 480 HP but lose 2 AC in the process.  You hadn't mentioned the HPs in your original post so I don't know how concerned you are about that issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, you could go the non-kama route but lose most of the boni of monking it.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: This is provided simply as a means for comparison as the AB seems a bit low to me, though the mundane DC is not bad @38.

SR 22 is OK for low levels, but by the time you get it it'll be less important. Poison immunity is worthless, buy antidotes, they`re cheap enough. The AC is a good point, but for that you only need Monk 10. I honestly don't know, but I think I would go with AB if I had to choose. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go for DevCrit, the bonus feat gained is exactly what you need:<br/>\n<br/>\n13- EWF<br/>\n16- OverCrit<br/>\n19- DevCrit<br/>\n22- Armor Skin<br/>\n25- Epic Prowess<br/>\n<br/>\nThat covers all your melee combat feats taken as bonus WM feats, then you can use regular ones for stat increases.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the record Fighter 8 Monk 10 WM 22 would grant you the +1 AB (going Monk 4 Fighter 6 WM 10 pre-epic you gain 1 BAB) and also 1 AC, but not the bonus feat (not in epics, but you do get an extra fighter bonus feat pre-epic), so maybe splitting the difference is the way to go?<br/>\n<br/>\nGood job, though. <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

Poison immunity is a resource saver in some cases, but no big deal either. So it's basically +1 AC and +10% speed vs +1 AB and 1 combat bonus feat (which Max shows how can be used).

      "content": "<div>The advantage of going Fighter is that you can take the feats for dual-wielding AND also WS / EWS. The disadvantage is that you'll need to get at least 15 DEX for ITWF. <br/>\n<br/>\nGoing as Ranger, you can ditch dex, because the class will give you the same feats at Ranger level 9 (actually Dual-wield at 1 and ITWF at 9) even if you don't meet the DEX requirement. BUT, there's a catch! Ranger feats don't work while wearing anything heavier than a light armor, so if you ditch dex and you wear light armor, that results in VERY LOW AC. The advantage is that monks lose their stuff if they wear ANY ARMOR AT ALL, so part of the benefit of going Fighter is lost, which would be being able to go with full plate and still dual. It's just a matter of personal preference, I guess. I would go Ranger 9 Monk 9 WM 22 for +1 AB.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"
