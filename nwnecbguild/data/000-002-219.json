Not an expert in that game, in fact could never bring myself to finish the mian story. I've always loved the idea of the game though, just too many problems. I recently saw a random comment on some random forum about NWN1 being so much better, so on a whim I checked it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n Why is it, that everything NWN2 is utterly incapable of, NWN1 has right out of the box!? WTF!?<br/>\n<br/>\n So, yeah, got NWN1 now and getting ready to play for first time ever. I only stopped to try and plan a build, but quickly realized I need to UNLEARN everything! *sigh*<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyone have updated links for some must-have mods? Been using Tony-K's AI for 2, but the link i found here in these forums is broken.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, would appreciate any suggestions or advice for cutting my teeth here.<br/>\n<br/>\n I know I'm about 20 years late on this, I apologize.<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, whoops, just now spotted the Introductions section of the forums. Sorry about that. XD<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thank you for the warm response. I can attest to the modding thing with NWN2 as I did try my hand at it at one point, and even with help accomplished a whole lot of nothing. Was attempting to give the Druid Shapeshifting ability what they're supposed to have instead of nothing but slight stat boosts. It seems even the modding community that does know how to do everything gave up on that though. Closest to it was people coming up with script that tracks enchantments and buffs and then reapplies them after you're wildshaped. Imagine turning into a Badger with claw attacks with 1d8 acid, 1d8 fire, vorpal, and vampiric leech, to give an idea what that looked like.<br/>\n<br/>\n I digress, thank you again for the warm welcome. I'm gunna head on over to the new vault shortly and grab Tony K's AI module. Anything else you might suggest just for modifying the OC+Expansions? Going in mostly blind.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, trying to load up the excell file you pointed towards even now. Normally Open Office doesn't have trouble loading XLSX files, but this one is a dousy. Thing just doesn't want to load. Thought about getting an excel viewer, but then I wouldn't be able to actually USE it, only look at it. -.- Ah well, I'll figure something out. Thank you for the help already!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
