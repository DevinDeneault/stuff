      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">So, I've been working with this idea for some time now, with little success, until I finally decided to drop DevCrit. Then it became a cool build much to my liking. This is a very defensive combo, despite the fact it has RDD boni, as it'll have very high AC even with a 2-handed weapon, but only 3 APR. Many people like the Bard 14 / PM 16 / RDD 10 spread better for EMA and EW, but to me that gives up some much needed offensive power. With a Bard 20 Curse Song, you can lower enemy AC by 5 while increasing your own AB by 2, damage by 3 and AC by 5 with a regular song. This build can also Taunt enemies to reduce their AC even further, and with Lasting Inspiration, your song uses will last you through those really tough battles against very well-built bosses that are present where I play. You should conserve your song uses for meaningful battles, because LI is only attained at 39, which is pretty bad but sort of unavoidable if you're building for max lvl 40 power. Critical immunity is only attained at 40, but if you want, you can be crit-immune by lvl 32, you'll need to drop 2 STR for 2 CHA, as Bard 20 has to be taken at 39 for max Tumble and UMD bonuses, so the 40th lvl needs to be either PM or RDD, and RDD 10 gives you +2 charisma, which will allow you to cast lvl 6 Bard spells. If you take Bard levels without having the Charisma bonus, you simply won't be able to LEARN any lvl 5 and 6 spells. You can just rely on your AC to avoid being critted, and have a sword / shield quickslot for emergencies. I still don't consider this build ready, so let me know how you guys think we could enhance it. There are certain things that are simply choices, like delaying such important features to lvl 39 and 40, but I don't mind as long as they are attained, as it makes it actually more challenging and interesting to level the build up to lvl 40.<br/>\n<br/>\nBard(20), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Pale Master(10), Human<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 18 (38)<br/>\nDEX: 10<br/>\nCON: 8 (10)<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 14

In general, though, I like the build a lot an see no major oops.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few of these item-dependent questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) How do you plan to reach Perform 50 or don't you care?  It's just a minor HP &amp; skill boost, but heck, it's there for taking if you can manage another 5 ranks (maybe empower Eagle's for 3 of them?? or swap ESkF: Disc for Perform??)... which brings me to...<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Why not empower all the level 2 buffs?  Bard 20 will assure 2 full turns of short duration buffs.  I typically don't consider Extend all that important with a 15+ caster/buffer unless there are static durations like 1 turn.  Besides, that empowered Eagle's will also help with your pedestrian DCs, too.   But if it easy to reach all the ability caps, you may not even need those buffs. BTW, I really dislike chasing enemies all over the bleedin' screen myself, so tend to only use War Cry on foes I am confident will NOT fail their Will save.  But to each his own, I suppose.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) I'm inclined to go with GS for Keen Edge buff but if Keen weapons abound, then once again, it's an item consideration choice though the crit range of GS seems worth a feat to me.  Also, I'm curious... can piercing/slashing weapons be keened with Keen Edge?  If so, perhaps going Exotic/Scythe is yet another option to consider.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Do you really NEED Discipline at 66 plus any additional STR buffs (would be 72 with ability cap w/o any discipline boosting gear). Just curious of the purpose here.<br/>\n<br/>\nFunny thing is... a former playmate of mine on a server now discontinued played this exact class split but as a semi-dexer kobold wielding a dagger/shield, complaining about how pathetic his damage was trying to kill bosses with over 1K HP.

I will have enough skill points to deal with mostly everything, and there is always the possibility of getting CHA-enhancing gear, more for the spells per day than for the Perform, though. With capped CHA, which I intend to have through items, you can reach 51 Perform. There is a quest item called Lord's Brooch, which casts on you Greater Eagle's Splendor on WoG, so a Nymph Cloak, potion or spell of Eagle's Splendor and this brooch should be enough. Otherwise, there is a +4 CHA ring I can equip.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>2) Why not empower all the level 2 buffs? Bard 20 will assure 2 full turns of short duration buffs.

BTW, I really dislike chasing enemies all over the bleedin' screen myself, so tend to only use War Cry on foes I am confident will NOT fail their Will save. But to each his own, I suppose.</div></blockquote>\n\nHere is how I play: I extend ALL Turn/Level buffs and cast regular Hour/Level ones so that my main buffs are sort of always on. When I rest, I immediately rebuff and it lasts me for the whole day after a certain level. I don't intend to use any DC spells, they are mostly for buffs, so I wouldn't even consider CHA enhancing for that purpose, only for spells per day in case I get dispelled. Here are a few of the useful extended buffs: Improved Invisibility, Keen Edge, Haste, Ghostly Visage, Wounding Whispers, Ethereal Visage, War Cry. The 2 last ones because there is hardly anything better to use anyway, you go invisible, buff and then equip armor, then rush in.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>3) I'm inclined to go with GS for Keen Edge buff but if Keen weapons abound, then once again, it's an item consideration choice though the crit range of GS seems worth a feat to me. Also, I'm curious... can piercing/slashing weapons be keened with Keen Edge? If so, perhaps going Exotic/Scythe is yet another option to consider.\n</div></blockquote>\n\nAgreed, so I will drop Armor Proficiency and use some DEX gear, but keep Martial Weapons for GS. Keen Edge is only for slashing, although you can find other keen weapons, such as Rapiers, Warhammers and stuff. But yeah, GS it is. There is an excellent scythe on WoG, but there is also the problem that this build is somewhat feat-starved, so I prefer to leave scythe wielding for a build with Fighter or CoT. I normally have each toon of mine use a different weapon so that I don't get bored with them and explore different options.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>4) Do you really NEED Discipline at 66 plus any additional STR buffs (would be 72 with ability cap w/o any discipline boosting gear). Just curious of the purpose here.\n</div></blockquote>\n\nMost of the time you don't, but the times when you do are crucial. I will lose some AC if I don't get discipline because there are very few KD immunity items that are worth using, and the toughest bosses on the server are the ones you will need to have a high discipline or immunity items against. Since this is a high AC build, the bosses will only hit on 20's so I can invest item slots in having more AC (Boots of the Sun Soul +5, which also incidentally grants you +3 DEX and is vital to this build if you are to equip yourself properly) and be sure I won't get KDed. My Pally WM can't kill two of the main server bosses because her Discipline is too low, and she has around 60. So yeah, 72 Discipline will assure that I won't get KDed and also that I can invest my item slots in something better than the KD immune boots the server has. But if where you play it isn't necessary, drop ESF and Epic Prowess for 2 Great Strengths for +1 Damage, it's a perfectly reasonable tweak for places where you don't need Discipline that much.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>Funny thing is... a former playmate of mine on a server now discontinued played this exact class split but as a semi-dexer kobold wielding a dagger/shield, complaining about how pathetic his damage was trying to kill bosses with over 1K HP. But he almost NEVER got hit. </div></blockquote>\n\nYeah, this is a very defensive combo by itself, so you should definitely make offensive choices when you get a chance, like going STR over DEX and 2-handed over sword / board. IMO he had excess AC, but lacked offensive power to compensate for it, not to mention that this build only has 3 APR. So let me make the change and I'll post it shortly.

A wand with 50 Improved Invis can be a real life saver.  I'd even be willing to drop Improved crit, so Max could keep the expertise/taunt combo, but for any build I make on WoG Craft wand is a must.  hehe.. a wand with 50 ice storms is also real sweet...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nConlaoch</div></blockquote>\n\nI am a Client of Djinni Dream for II Wands, so I buy sort of all my wands from him. However, I understand your argument. Perhaps I can be ur customer as well? Hehe. As for still, I plan on using the Fire Giant Wizardesses Armor, which is a Chain Shirt that gives -20% Arcane Spell Failure, but until I can buy or attain one of those, yeah, take off armor to buff, but since I'll be invisible when I approach most foes, to me that's not a problem, All I need to do is quickslot the armor. Since he's a 2-handed Juggernaut, that's the only thing you'll need to remove to buff.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

There is also some real nice drow chain +4 that has the -20% Arcane Spell Failure.  I find it for sale occasionally at the gnomes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for knockdown immunity, there is a thieves hood in Undermountain that gives you knockdown immunity.  With your UMD it should easily be usable.  LOL.. i think i even recall how to get there as well.
