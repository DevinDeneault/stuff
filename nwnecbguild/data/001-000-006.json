Etc <br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a growing persistent World and are in need of a good scripter to write some (probably pretty standard in the grand scheme of Nwns) complex scripting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is paid work, price negotiated per script. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!</div>"

They'll probably have to learn the NWN scripting system, but if they are worth anything, that should not prove difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what I did, way back when.\u00a0 Got a brilliant scripter that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was the son of a Japanese diplomat.\u00a0 Fell down the NWN rabbit hole so hard, he almost flunked out of college.<br/>\n<br/>\nLost him after he graduated.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd tbh, this is basically what you will need - someone with the time, energy, and interest.\u00a0 And this basically means student.\u00a0</div>"
