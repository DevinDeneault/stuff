Also, no RDD. It takes special permission, and I hate it.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Melee preference - Two-handed sustained damage<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Range preference - Probably Zen, based on other factors. If I do ranged combat.<br/>\n<br/>\n7) Weapon preference - Greatsword or Halberd, because reach.<br/>\n<br/>\n8) Maximum item enhancement - This is the information I was able to dredge up.\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Enchantment_basin\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://wiki.arelith.com/Enchantment_basin</a><br/>\n<br/>\n9) Spellcasting - I don't know enough about Arelith to really have a strong idea here. My thought is that since they cap certain buffs, I should probably want a bit more of a mix of offense and buff spells. I'd like an elemental or naturalistic focus.<br/>\n<br/>\n10) Custom factors - Arelith, and everything that entails.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking for a woodsy reach fighter with some spellcasting for versatility. Playable from 3+, since Arelith does at least start you at 3, it just takes hours to get to 4.</div>"

He even has UMD so he can use magical scrolls &amp; other devices. More than that, rogue also provide him with evasion &amp; full tumble for better armour class. Making him a barbarian is more a matter of how you present him rather that of the build. This build has absolutely top-notch AB &amp; Damage, it is designed specifically for that. Perhaps if you could explain us better why this isn't to your liking then we should be able to help you more.</div>"
