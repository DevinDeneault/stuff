      "content": "<div>Hello,<br/>\n<br/>\nA little background on this guy. I'm looking to take this guy through Aielund so max build lvl 37. For a concept im thinking a Mauradin Bronzebeard type fellow, Dwarfish so I can't stand less then 18 Str for long and the focus near the end on more paladin powers. I chose the warhammer for RP reasons as a mighty warhammer just feels right for this dwarvish pally. I chose to drop improved crit due to the minimal range on the hammer, used the extra feat for better will saves as I hear Aielund will need them.<br/>\n<br/>\nDivine Might and Shield for those sweet boosts and HS to help with tthe self buffing, HS Cat's grace will top out the armour dex bonus as its a standard +4 and the pot will be used before the spell is available.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking through the forum I have only found\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=2293531&amp;p=358&amp;hilit=paladin+fighter#p358\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Harper Champion</a>\u00a0(Dexer)\u00a0with similar lvls (fighter instead of CoT), the archive has a number of similar builds focused on Divine Smite, and these 2\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://file///F:/NWN%20Builds/builds/data/build238421.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tymora's Charismatic Champion</a>\u00a0(Dexer), and Cin's\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://file///F:/NWN%20Builds/builds/data/build212002.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Harper's Champion</a>, the last of which is the closest to my build spirit but focuses on MIG not CHA.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have an alternate build to the one below create with Fighter swapped in for CoT, it gains weapon spec and epic weapon spec for significally weaker Will and Reflex saves.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince this is my first build my main questions are my lvling priority, is it good? And I am not sure on my feat selection, choosing CoT for the increased saves felt right, but losing +6 DMG didn't. I am set on a dwarf cause.....Dwarves! CoT and HS just felt like the right fit for this meleer but if there are any suggestions I can always rethink those. Warhammer could be changed with BattleAxe or, if feats allow, Dwarven War Axe.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for any help,<br/>\n<br/>\n~ Kaylion\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><strong>*edited</strong></span> as per suggestions below. Main changes are P(24)/CoT(8)/HS(5) to P(22)/CoT(10)/HS(5) which gives higher saves and boosted divine wrath with no negatives. Another change was 14 Con to 12, 12 Int to 14. This allowed full taunt, which helps with the lower AB and additional listen.\u00a0 Have left original build inside a spoiler.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladin(22), Champion of Torm(10), Harper Scout(5),

Search is essentially an inert skill - you're seeking things that are stationary and immobile (traps). Listen picks up on noises created by movement, so unless some clever bastard's come up with a floating trap, you're sound.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, I'm liking you already. Aielund fan and Dwarf fan, yeah! Just got to swing you away from this Pally nonsense to Monks and DwDs now, then we'll start getting our wall up against these puffed-up arcanists and religious zealots!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Ninja'd by Valerfor, but what the hell...</div>",

I'm a huge fan of monks but DwD is just a class I can't seem to have any inclination to try. I actually have a run using your Harding Brightwater going that I put on hold for this guy.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust finished up Act 1, changed Extra turning for KD...I felt the lack of KD, meant to have it in the build and during inital shuffling it got lost. So far pretty good, the wyrm was easier then expected. Was not ready for an entire party in full plate before the Barb's. Made the last part easier.</div>"

Of course, Aielund comes close at level 36/37. And Swordflight will eventually reach 40, but still has another couple of modules to come before it's completed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll leave it to others to recommend a good PW<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> If you're interested, you can get more info on Mines of Twin Summit from the New full Epic Series of Modules thread in the General Discussion section, while there's more on Sands of Fate and Aribeth's Redemption in the respective threads in the Modules section.</div>",

Iirc, the same is true of kukris and morningstars - so that's 3 of my favourites out the window (And I don't think there are many decent flails - great or small - and only one or two quality battleaxes). It is indeed a bit restrictive on what weapons to focus/spec in.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, excellent story ain't it! I hope you went with companions - they actually something, for once.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I don't know whether you've had a look or not, but going back to the earlier DwD discussion, Mirnaia is currently taking my dex Monk 30/ DwD 5/ SD 5 for a drive through MTS. Yes, it's a mostly defensive build, but it ain't stuck in clay, and has an AB (unarmed) of 41. Just something different to look at.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers - and congratulations!</div>",

So it helps to know what they use. There is also a lot of monk items, even if there is no monk henchman. There are some very good ranged weapons, both bows and x-bows. In general are most needs for equipment taken care of. If you want to focus on a completely different weapon, you can have weapons upgraded in most of the chapters by NPCs you meet.\n</details></div>",
