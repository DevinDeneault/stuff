Crits (though RDD would have a higher DC).<br/>\n<br/>\n Thoughts?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Ranger 26 (28)/ Bard 4 (2)/ Rdd 10 is what you want in this case. The huge stat bonuses and more importantly the dragonic armour and fire immunity compined with the undispellable Ranger spells (freedom, cat's, e.t.c) will give you more power, leaving you room for more favored enemies as well. Bane of enemies plus huge strength and a 2-handed weapon will make you feel like a demigod in the field of battle while dragonic armour gives you back some of the armour that you lose for fighting without a sheild. Bard will also allow you to max out that sweet spellcraft for a nice plus 9/11 to all your saves Vs spells.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

While I agree with Valerfor that RDD is best in this situation (and it's a favorite class of mine), a Fighter / WM / (something else) can be quite a force to be reckoned with, well worth giving it a try.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Moreover you don't get full Tumble this way so you lose 4 AC amongst other things such as no UMD e.t.c<br/>\n<br/>\n So, not really worth it if you ask my opinion, at least not with this level spread. I would recommend a Ranger 30/ Rogue-(Bard) 3/ WM 7 if you wanted to incorporate WM in your build. Your AB will be high anyway probably a net (47) and you will have all the benefits of the Rogue as well, such as full tumble skill, evasion, UMD, e.t.c<br/>\n<br/>\n But, for all your effort the (Ranger/ Bard/ RDD) will still be a better option overall.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
