      "content": "<div>They just murdered the shape for good, in the altar of \"intended behaviour\" and \"consistency\". Lord, do I sound salty, apologies for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nA small caveat, if a Druid/Shifter quick-slots ice storm from the spellbook (instead of using the wheel) it would have the Caster Level of the Shifter and the Damage Dice of the Druid.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeaning a Druid 28 Monk 2 Shifter 10 casting the ability as mentioned would get: 10+d20 spell penetration (CL=10) and 3d6\u00a0bludgeon + 11d6 cold damage (CL=28).<br/>\n<br/>\nConsistent indeed.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!</div>"

      "content": "<div>I went to <em>nwn developer discord</em> before writing here with my findings and the scripts behave as stated: CL for spell penetration grabs shifter levels, and damage is calculated by Druid (first class?) CL.<br/>\n<br/>\nReason being they didn't go deep enough on backwards compatibility, or the behaviour is deeply ingrained on the engine itself and on not modifiable scripts.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother argument about how this changes has a cascade of unforeseen consequences is that now, if you go shifter heavy for spellcasting purposes you can't qualify to automatic metamagic feats since the require a class being able to cast IX level spells (meaning having 17 levels of a caster class!).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's currently a debate, so let's see what comes out of it.</div>"

      "content": "<div>So, as far as I understand, the issue comes from this shape using true spells (not spell-like-abilities) and those, as of now,\u00a0 to get caster level you invoke:<br/>\n<em><strong><br/>\nint\u00a0</strong>GetCasterLevel(<br/>\n</em><br/>\n<em>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<strong>object</strong>\u00a0oCreature</em><br/>\n<em>);</em><br/>\n<br/>\nThis still returns the Cl corresponding for class_0, that being the first class. <em>BUT</em> the baffling thing is when the spell if fired, you need to check resistances, so now, the script is:<br/>\n<em><br/>\n<strong>int</strong>\u00a0MyResistSpell(<br/>\n</em><br/>\n<em>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<strong>object</strong>\u00a0oCaster,</em><br/>\n<em>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<strong>object</strong>\u00a0oTarget,</em><br/>\n<em>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<strong>float</strong>\u00a0fDelay = 0.0f</em><br/>\n<em>);</em><br/>\n<br/>\nThe perceptive reader would notice that\u00a0 oCaster \u2260 oCreature , meaning the spell resistance check looks (somehow) at a different parameter other than the \"caster level\" calculated in the first script. The recent patch seems to have set this oCaster parameter be the Shifter levels so there's a mismatch between damage and spell penetration.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake this interpretation as an unreliable one since I stared at assembly code for an hour, to crawl back to something more readable and got to this conclusion.<br/>\nI did my best to present this issue to the devs but I wasn't able to read the room to get an idea if this is gonna be fixed in the future (or ever for that matter), so in conclusion, approach shifter builds at your own peril since the class is messier than before.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!</div>"
