I read the wiki page, and could see the AC benefits (bear in mind my preference for melee-types), bards being able to take epic spells (though I'm unclear how that works in practice), and the increase in spell slot numbers, but it's this last one that brings me to my first question.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's the point in heavy investment in PM levels when you'll just have more crappy spells to cast? Surely\u00a0 you need to be able to cast some higher levels spells before more slots becomes advantageous?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, are their summons any use, or can a decent cleric/ pally/ arcanist/ and even ranger with a FE in undeads just blow 'em away, or even a simple grunt knock 'em into next week?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and are they INT or CHA casters, or does that depend on their \"mother\" class?<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's start with those three, though I imagine there will be more questions later. I've never played or built one (well, I did, but it was a kind of joke character from \"Kings of the Wyld\"), and we are sadly lacking in a Guide to the class here (which reminds me, I promised to draw up a CoT Guide about 150 years ago - someone prod me if it's still not forthcoming by March, eh?).<br/>\n<br/>\nInquiring minds need to know!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I agree with Web on this one!<br/>\nBoth the PM and RDD classes were introduced as prestige classes for spellcasters. However, they failed at that and their main use in power builds is for melee characters.<br/>\nPM offers a serious boost to AC and gets immunity to crits at level 10. It is a great way to defend against devastating critical.<br/>\nAt PM level 15 the character can start taking epic spells, no level 9 spell casting needed.<br/>\nPrimary saving throws are fortitude and will. That can be beneficial for some builds, but be careful and don't take too many levels pre epic with the 1/2 BAB progression of the PM class.<br/>\nFor casters, you get extra spell slots and access to new spell levels at half the normal rate.  Wizards can read up on spells and learn higher level spells that way. Sorcerers and bards can use the higher level slots for meta magic.<br/>\nThe <em>big problem</em> with PM casters is that the caster level does not scale with PM levels. There has been much talk about fixing this, but I do not know the current status.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a build where I also use PM for it's class skills. It is a Wizard10/ PM2/ Assassin28, where I take the first PM level at character level 5 to benefit from the Hide and Move silently class skills of the PM class to qualify for Assassin at level 6. <br/>\nThe build has Int 16 and can learn level 6 spells with only 10 wizard levels because of the slots from PM.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Fighter offers feats galore for EDR, and PM offers immunities, while you still have reasonably high Wizard levels with indispellability and a fair spell penetration. I really like the concept!<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, the PM class has had success as part of melee builds with a high AC, immunity to dev crit and sneak-/death attacks, and even offering epic spells. Most often these builds are based on bard to qualify for PM and also providing important class skills, such as tumble, discipline, listen, spellcraft and UMD.

That latter would be me.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, something Mick mentioned earlier about PM and RDD both being PRCs that benefited melee builds more than caster ones (by and large), so I thought \"why not sew the two together - and in a fairly extreme way\". So I have, and the results are below. Please note, I have not included this in the Build Request forum and that is because it's purely experimental in nature (unless, ofc, you like it, in which case I'll move it). I wanted it to be as purely melee-based as possible (given that it requires at least 3 levels of caster - well 5 in this case - and has 2 \"supernatural\" classes baked in), so no damage shields, acid sheaths, epic warding, etc. Just a sturdy fellow whose whole purpose is to block doors, bridges, vision, drains, and so forth.
