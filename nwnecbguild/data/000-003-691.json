Ranger has the AB, even spells, but not the right spells, and the spells come later.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleric/SD/Ass, gives good AB, BAB, early spellcasting, GOOD BUFFS.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat combination is probably the best, OPTIMIZED, but it does have the CON of lack of skill points, and cross classing, and not being able to take SD, Assassin until later, instead of earlier at lev 6.<br/>\n<br/>\nFortunately that is mitigated by playing a human, having a 14 int, for extra skill points. Also taking SD, Assassin at levels 9, 10, instead of earlier at lev 6, is not that bad. And taking 8 levs of cleric to start can be good.<br/>\n<br/>\nI took the magic domain, and War domains for the wizardly buffing spells: Mage Armor, Cats Grace, Stoneskin for BEST OVERALL SPELL BUFFING PACKAGE IN THE GAME. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis combination is great at both, going alone, and in a party as a support, healer, trap disabler, lock opener, scout, flanker, artillery(Ice Storm, Melfs Acid Arrow, decent damage spells), Party Buffer, semi back up tank(has decent AB, AC), death attacker, turn undead, etc, great at finding a way to deal with most stuff, good summoning package.<br/>\n<br/>\nPre Epic Split is:<br/>\n<br/>\nCleric 11, /,Shadowdancer 4,/, Assassin 5<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall Split of Cleric 11, SD 5, Assassin 24.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere I need Help:<br/>\n<br/>\nNeed Help with Epic Feat Selection at what, which Epic levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Arkhalia PW, a balance between Epic Action and non enforced, but semi encouraged roleplay.<br/>\n<br/>\nEquipment goes up to + 8.<br/>\n<br/>\nMust have a minimum AB of 55 to 60 to 65 for non spellcasters, to survive at levels 35 to 40.(what the PW recommends)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo might need help getting to at least 50 AB with this build.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I am not the best planner, and not good at putting everything that took at what, which levels, as far as stats, HP, BAB, AB, Saves, AC, Feats, Skills, etc, in a Organized way.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if someone could help me do that, that sure would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter I get help, and as I get help, and as I make decisions, and progress the build on Arkhalia PW, I will update this, and try to post a organizing post of this build(again I might need help doing that, and crunching the numbers, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAsturonethoriusaline(Mike for short)</div>"

Thats ONLY 2 less then rogue.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you get Ghostly Visage, Uncanny Dodge, Death Attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe death attack paralyzes opponents, except for undead.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe plan is to use Hide in Plain Site(HIPS), and Ghostly Visage, Shadow Evade to sneak up to foes, hit them with say a 5 to 20 D6 Death Attack that 1. Does about 50 to 100 to 150 damage, then with a high Death Attack DC, they get paralyzed, where you can either disengage, HIPS, then Death attack them again, paralyze them again, do another 50 to 100 to 150 to 200 damage. Rinae, Repeat over and over. Or you can just finish them off after the first, second death attack paralyzation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if the paralyzation doesnt work, you still can HIPS, get at least the sneak attack damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you can use poison, to inlict stat damage to weaken their str, con, dex, AB, AC, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the only thing Assassin may not get is Evasion. Assassins may or may not get it, I dint know.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut even if dont get Evasion, toon has high Dex save to evade anyways, an or the toon can just kill or paralyze the source that would seem to make Evasion seem like it necessary. And the toon can disable traps, making Evasion less needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think trading Evasion for Death Attack, Ghostly Visage, Poison use, etc, is a FAIR trade off.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the splits, if going to go with Assassin, the death attack DC needs to be as high as possible. <br/>\n<br/>\nA Assassin needs to have at least about 22,23,24 levels at minimum.<br/>\n<br/>\nA Cleric 11/ SD 5, Assassin 24, accomplishes that. Also there are Assassin Specific either abilities or Epic Feats, etc, that a Assassin only gets at about level 22,23,24.<br/>\n<br/>\nMick Dagger a credible poster here is kind of a expert at, on Assassins, and he recommends an Assassin level minimum of about 22,23,24, and as high as go up to level 30 depend on if there is room, IF the Assassin part is the Primary of the toon.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy Cleric 11? Because Cleric 11 is the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM level for, to get 6th level spells like Blade Barrier, and Absolute mininum for buffs according to experts here is about level 11,12, if Cleric is NOT your primary, and is instead your secondary or third.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso Cleric Level 11 lets me mazimize Assassin as much as possible at level 24..<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I go Cleric Level 15/SD 5, that would only allow 20 levels of Assassin, which would probably not be enough Assassin levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf going to take only 20 levels or less, your right that Rogue would probably be better then Assassin.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah a Cleric 11/ SD 4/Assassin 5 is semi sub optimal for Pre Epic, for Post Epic BAB, AB, but that is only about 1,2,3, about + or - 1 point, difference to BAB, AB, and thats not that bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, if Assassin can get its special things by, on Assassin level 23, instead of level 24, then that would leave enough room for a Cleric 12/SD 5/Assassin 23 post Epic, and a 12/4/4 pre epic split. I might need Mick Dagger's or others help here on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if go with Rogue, instead of Assassin, then a Cleric 15/SD 5/Rogue 20, would work just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I think that Cleric/SD/Assassin build can also take epic dodge, BUT they just have to take the right feats to qualify. At least thats what I remember reading in the WIKI, but I could be wrong there.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere I need the most help is which epic feats to get and when to take them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike.</div>"

Cleric/SD/Assassin <em>can</em> also get ED, but only if you take 10 levels of SD, and that leaves little room for Assassin.<br/>\nMy recommendations are Cleric 26/ Rogue 13/ SD 1 or Cleric 26/ Monk 9/ SD 5.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are bent on Assassin for the Death attack paralysis, beware that it has been nerfed with NWN EE.\u00a0<br/>\nIf you still want Assassin, Monk 9/ SD 5/ As 26 and Rogue 13/ SD 1/ As 26 are solid Assassin builds with ED.<br/>\nIf you still want Cleric for the buffs, remember that you have to cross-class the stealth skills and will need 13 levels of Cleric before you can pick Assassin.\u00a0<br/>\nI would suggest the following class split; Cleric 15/ Assassin 24/ SD 1, where SD is there for HIPS and nothing more.<br/>\nIf you stop at Cleric 13, 14 or 15 pre epic, your best BAB at lvl 20 will be 14. You cannot stop at Cleric 12 because you need Cleric 13 before you can go with Assassin and you don't want Cleric 16 if you are serious about improving the Death attack DC.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not saying that Cleric/Assassin is a bad idea, after all it is a Cleric build, but there are better Cleric builds and there are better Assassin builds.</div>",

      "content": "<div>As has already been noted here, with the EE Death Attack changes a rogue is better than an assassin in almost all ways. For example, a Rog13/Cler26/SD1 would work better than a Cler/Ass/SD and would be able to pick up Epic Dodge while keeping undispellable cleric buffs. If you're sticking with Cler/Ass/SD then a Cler15/Ass23/SD2 gets +20 AB from cleric buffs, level 8 cleric spells, HiPS, and Evasion. You will be constantly managing your buffs due to the low duration but it could work for you, depending on what you want from the build. Cler14/Ass4/SD2 is the best pre-epic spread, which you have already pointed out in one of your earlier posts.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor high assassin builds that also get Epic Dodge I would recommend a Monk9/Ass26/SD5, Rang7/Ass23/SD10, Rang9/Ass21/SD10, or Rog13/Ass26/SD1.<br/>\n<br/>\nDruids can get up to +24Hide/+4MS from buffs, not including Vine Mine and the +4 Hide/MS bonus from being outside. However for AB buffs, which an assassin heavy build will definitely want, you will need to be a Cleric.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Thanks for all the help comments. As Yunim has said a Assassin heavy build with lots of levels CRYS out for AB, AC, Buffs to AB, AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a cleric with the Magic, War Domains would be the BEST at doing that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that going Cleric, SD, Ass, is NOT Optimally viable, doable, and is only doable if go with a Cleric 14/SD2/Ass 4, pre epic split, and Cleric 14,15/SD 2,4/Ass 22,23, and cant take Assassin until 14,15th lev.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I went back to the drawing board.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn doing so I found out that Assassin on Arkhalia gets HIPS at 8th level, which is a game changer.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs nice as Shadowdancer is, its now not as necessary because can use Monk, Assassin, to get Evasion, HIPS.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of that can now go Monk/Cleric/Ass.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow doing that on any other PW, without SD, would cause no HIPS, but on Arkhalia, 6 levels of monk, gives cleave, Evasion, Knockdown, Improved Knockdown(No need to spend valuable feat slots on them), makes it so that can take assassin at 6th lev. 12 levels of Cleric provides 6th lev spells, buffs, 22 levels of Assassin.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly thing that miss out on is: Shadow Evade, Summon Shadow Companion, Defensive Roll, Epic Dodge.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for giving up those things, for what get, thats a fair trade off in my book.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo thats what I am going to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nGona post that build in another thread, and welcome help with that build.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the help here.</div>"
