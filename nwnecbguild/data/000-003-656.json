Improved Knockdown &amp; Blind Fight\u00a0level 9, ITWF lvl 12, and Crippling Strike Level 14.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nEnding sneak attack is 15d6 which is more than ample. if you want more, you could drop the epic skill foci for improved sneak attack for 17d6<br/>\n<br/>\nTaunt 41(53) is in the build to assist the character to hit things, as with Base 40 AB it good, taunt helps with up to effective +6 AB when needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also put Power Attack, Divine Might and EWS in the build, so damage can be boosted with +11 physical and +2-8 divine damage / hit to help deal with physical damage resistant critical/sneak immune opponents.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've also found a way to avoid exp penalties completely, which is great. This does create a large mid epic section where Discipline does not have a skill dump.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/202003/10759084_2ba57ed623b670a814fd1fd102d08124.jpg\"/><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:50%;line-height:normal\">Image source:\u00a0\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://data.whicdn.com/images/254265481/original.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://data.whicdn.com/images/254265481/original.jpg</a></span><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscipline is largely there to avoid getting Improved Disarmed (ID) and provide Knockdown resistance. Improved Disarm is not a major feature of many modules, however some modules it is an issue that will have to be carefully managed.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nWill save 17(21) will be another weakness, its partly protected with fear immunity (allowing you to ignore those fear circles around undead &amp; dragons &amp; others) and 20 points in spellcraft but best to drink a few clarity potions, use UMD for Prot v Evil scrolls / Lesser Mind Blank etc<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other usual weaknesses, no DC arcane spells like Bigby's/IGMS, dev critters/implosion, petrify users, powerful ranged opponents are a pain for everyone, I believe careful strategy and boosting the fort save helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nI put the HP to 360 so the character can tank combined with epic dodge, improved evasion and a great fort and reflex save, add a shield as well, equip a few constitution boosting items and buffs.<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman is there for the extra pre-epic feat and extra skill points, medium size to wield two shortswords (dual sword builds are cool).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nHalfling might have higher AB with two daggers, I chose to not pursue this however<br/>\n<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Rogue(29), Paladin(5), Fighter(6), Human\nSTR: 14\nCON: 12\nINT: 14\n\n01: Rogue(1): Ambidexterity, Two-Weapon Fighting\n03: Paladin(1): Weapon Focus: Shortsword\n05: Rogue(2): {Evasion}\n07: Rogue(4)\n09: Rogue(5): Blind Fight\n11: Rogue(7)\n13: Rogue(9)\n15: Rogue(11): Power Attack\n17: Rogue(12)\n19: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Shortsword\n21: Rogue(13): Epic Weapon Focus: Shortsword, Epic Skill Focus: Taunt\n23: Rogue(15)\n25: Rogue(16): Improved Evasion\n27: Rogue(18): Great Dexterity I, (DEX=22)\n29: Rogue(20)\n31: Rogue(22)\n33: Rogue(24): Epic Fortitude, Epic Dodge\n35: Rogue(26)\n37: Rogue(28): Epic Skill Focus: Discipline\n39: Fighter(6): Great Dexterity III, Epic Prowess, (DEX=27)\n\nSkillpoints: 407\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +4, Traps: +5\nAB (max, naked): 40 (melee), 37 (ranged)\nSpell Casting:\u00a0\n\n\n01: Disable Trap(4), Hide(4), Move Silently(4), Open Lock(1), Search(4), Set Trap(1), Spot(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(14),\u00a0\n03: Discipline(1), Taunt(6), Save(12),\u00a0\n05: Disable Trap(1), Hide(4), Move Silently(4), Search(1), Set Trap(4), Spot(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4),\u00a0\n07: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(2), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(2),\u00a0\n09: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Search(2), Spot(2), Tumble(2), UMD(2),\u00a0\n11: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(4), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(2),\u00a0\n13: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(12),\u00a0\n15: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(22),\u00a0\n17: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Spot(2), Tumble(2), UMD(2), Save(18),\u00a0\n19: Discipline(1), Save(11),\u00a0\n21: Disable Trap(4), Hide(4), Move Silently(4), Spot(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4),\u00a0\n23: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(2), Search(3), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n25: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Spot(2), Tumble(2), UMD(2),\u00a0\n27: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spellcraft(3), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n29: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spellcraft(5), Spot(1), Tumble(1),\u00a0\n31: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spellcraft(5), Spot(1), Tumble(1),\u00a0\n33: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), Save(10),\u00a0\n35: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), Save(22),\u00a0\n37: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), Save(34),\u00a0\n39: Discipline(1), Save(11),\u00a0</details>\nOther similar builds:<br/>\n<br/>\nAren't really many, perhaps my recent <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/yondalla-s-divine-champion-rogue-27-paladin-3-cot--t2355385.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Yondalla's Divine Champion Rogue 27/Paladin 3/CoT 10</a> draft I posted<br/>\n<br/>\nSearching the Archives and Filter for Rogue 13+/Paladin 1+/Fighter 1+ builds, only Mithdradates's <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build198956.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fearless Cavalier</a> and Avado's <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build246093.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tyr's Devastating Thud</a> use Paladin as a minor class, both are Dev Crit builds\u00a0<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Builds with 13 to 40 levels of rogue, 1 to 40 levels of paladin, and 1 to 40 levels of fighter.\nBuilds are sorted by class.\nDexterity Paladin\u00a0fighter 12 / paladin 15 / rogue 13\u00a0(human)\u00a0by FinneousPJ\nFame\u00a0paladin 20 / fighter 4 / rogue 16\u00a0(elf)\u00a0by bloodymerc\nAvenging Commando\u00a0rogue 17 / paladin 15 / fighter 8\u00a0(half-orc?)\u00a0by Ithacan\nFilter search for Rogue 13+/Paladin 1+/Fighter 1+</details>\n\nAnyway looked like a cool and underexplored concept, something I'd be interested to play, so I thought I'd share, happy to hear any comments RE the build draft</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hail SnorriHT and Gkorjax!<br/>\nThanks for your kind replies<br/>\nI did think of you Gkorjax when I wrote this build draft, I know you like these stealthy builds<br/>\n<br/>\nI think all builds can be modified to suit the environment they play in as Gkorjax is already thinking<br/>\nI write a general build description to describe what might suit many players, they can then modify as needed<br/>\nI did very much wish to have Str and Int to 14 actually, it adds 43 extra skill points and extra carry capacity. Dropping starting Con to 12 is probably the best way to do it.<br/>\nElf is a very attractive variant. There will be 40% exp penalties pretty early on which may deter many but for some that is no problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlippery Mind can be fit into the build, perhaps by dropping ESF: Discipline and putting ESF: Taunt later (so you can take slippery mind earlier early epic), as Crippling Strike is quite good as Gkorjax wrote, -2 Str per sneak attack you eliminate the offensive capabilities rapidly, destroy their discipline score allowing you to knockdown them down more easily and slow them down to a crawl, its excellent against sneak vulnerable opponents who heal themselves a lot.\u00a0<br/>\nEpic Will can be fit in too, my suggestion is to swap this with toughness.</div>"

Add a fear aura and that is a vanilla rogue's worst nightmare.\u00a0<br/>\nSounds like a dragon to me!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yes I didn't answer your question about the Will save -&gt; UMD and Clarity potions are often enough to protect the low Will save if you are smart<br/>\nGkorjax has taught me a lot actually how to play low Will save builds<br/>\n<br/>\nThe exception being against mixed mobs of warriors and casters who can dispel these<br/>\nYou probably can manage this by taking them on one at a time if you are solo, or with traps, or in a party with a cleric or mage casting Protection vs Evil/Clarity/Lesser Mind Blank/Mind Blank on you which will have dispel resistance (or 'undispellability' if their caster levels are 24+)<br/>\n<br/>\nDefensive roll I agree with you is not a great feat, it is only there because it is required for Epic Dodge.
