Yeah i know that's not ideal either but it is the only option we have for a two-handed katana. Ideally katana should be a finessable weapon and it is much-much better represented in systems that is not D20 but D10 (Legend of the Five Rings R.P.G), there you use your agility to hit someone and katana gives you an initiative bonus as well because it is so fast a weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\n You are right about the evasion, normally you don't need that at first level, but this way i could take more skill points Fist.<br/>\n<br/>\n It is always nice to see fellow Kensai enthusiasts!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thank you for the extremely quick reply (considering time zones and all that)!<br/>\nNow, I'm aware of the possibilities. Also, if I wanted a tin can, I wouldn't look at this build at all. I mean, just add a +5 Tower Shield and a Dwarven Battleaxe, you get better damage, better crits and better defense, but you lose something more important, namely charm, feeling, whatever you want to call it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy problem is that I play on a very high-magic PW where the only viable solo builds are DD or Wiz. The \"ordinary\" fighter won't last against monsters with 70-ish AB, 60-ish AC and lots of immunities. So, since I won't be able to solo the high-end areas without one of those builds, I might as well go with something that's fun to play with. Also, DevCrit is nerfed to 50ish +damage. I'll mess around with this build a bit and see what I can make of it, so it fits my style and the PW I play on, but it's a very good start for me. I have several other lvl 40 toons, but I haven't found the one that feels right, so I was looking for something like this. Thank you!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The blade is triangular in cross section and fairly rigid, tapering to a sharp point blunted with a stop, or button.<br/>\n<table class=\"post_content_table\"><tbody><tr><td>Rapier / espada ropera</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Mass</td>\n<td>avg. <strong>1 kg (2.2 lb)</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Blade length</td>\n<td>avg. 104 cm (41 in)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Width</td>\n<td>avg. 2.5 cm (0.98 in) to sharp point</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Blade type</td>\n<td>single or double edged, straight blade</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\nSo as one can plainly see, the Katana should NEVER, EVER be a finesse weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, it is entirely possible now, thanks to BD, to make a Katana finesseable (and to make a Nodachi, a real one) - that has all the appropriate weapon feats, etc.\u00a0 It does require some 2da edits, however.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
