The loss of Skill Points shouldn't be too big a deal since I would drop Bluff altogether (unless there is an Arelith specific use for it).  Swapping your INT increases for DEX lets you end up with DEX 28 so +2 to AB and AC.  Also, Bard Song 16 only needs 30 ranks in Perform so ESF: Perform is wasted (unless there are other benefits to have such a high Perform).  I would take Armor Skin instead.  Also, Taunting won't be useful because you have to be right next to the opponent whereas you want to be far away.

I'd get AT LEAST 8, but that would require some reworking in both stats and probably feats too (dropping starting INT by 1 then dropping ESF<img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" />erform for Great Int would do the trick, or you could raise your STR to 10 and lower your INT modifier by 1, ending up on 14 and swapping ESF<img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" />erform for AS like Demos suggested).<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

And I Turns out Dodge and Mobility did different things from what I understood they did xD, so They are a huge waste . And the ESF: preform could get removed for more usefulness, from what I read on wiki, I though If I maxed preform it would make better bard song . Never really put anything is SRT, but guess that would help damage.. specially whit dart. And in Arelith Bluff and preform are used for a -describe action, but not sure if they stack and Bluff is high enough for it anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough Last time I tested this the build worked.. I retried it and found the DC to low for anything near level.. and Death Attack doesn't give many Death Attacks anyway soo.. I think this is a bust. (maybe that's just my playing though) And making DC higher is getting more Assassin levels which ruins my idea of Curse songing them for DC lowering saves and then Death attacking them all so they are paralyzed.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Death Attack relies on a Fort Save and Curse Song applies a -2 penalty at song levels 15 and 16, and a -1 penalty at song levels 3 to 14.

You lose 1 on the Fort Save from Curse, but gain 5 to the Death Attack DC, so you come out ahead by 4 points.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, Bard 11 only has access to level 4 spells so your CHA needs to only be 14 and so you have a few more points to use on your starting spread.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

When you attack someone for the first time, they're flat-footed and out of combat mode. The fact that they're out of combat will trigger the paralysis effect of Death Attack, not the fact that they're flat-footed. They'll roll the save and from then on, you'll have to disengage from combat (and make your opponent disengage as well) to be able to apply the paralysis effect again. Now if you keep fighting the guy and then KD him, for example, on top of your head, you'll read Death Attack because he is flat-footed, but he won't be rolling vs paralysis because he's already in combat, just the extra damage will be applied. Basically, not everytime you see Death Attack pop out of your head means that the other guy is making a save.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two ways to disengage that you can use with this toon: <br/>\n<br/>\n1- Use Darkness: cast it behind you, go in it then hide again, come out after a few seconds and hit the guy \"for the first time\" again. <br/>\n<br/>\n2- Cast invisibility on yourself or drink an Invisibility potion, wait 6 seconds after they've stopped chasing you and attack again. Invisibility potions / scrolls also work.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's why HiPS is so valuable to Assassins, they can use it to \"spam\" Death Attacks and paralyze everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
