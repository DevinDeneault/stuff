There are only 4 builds with these classes in the old archive, and only one with this class spread, but they are all very different from this character.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis build has full BAB and a high unbuffed AB. It has several \"turbo modes\" to boost AB and damage further. In fact the character can buff AB to the 20 cap (GMW +5, Divine favor +5, Divine wrath +7,\u00a0 Bless,Aid,Prayer +3). You can also add another +6 AB from Taunt, not counting towards the +20 cap. Smite also adds +11 AB, not counting towards the cap.<br/>\nThe spells Eagle's splendor, Aura of glory and the Eagle's splendor feat from HS all stack and let you cap Charisma at 32 granting a +11 bonus to the Divine feats (Divine wrath, Divine grace, Divine Might, Divine Shield, Smite evil, Lay on hands and Turn undead)<br/>\n<br/>\nDivine favor: +5 AB, +5 damage<br/>\nTaunt: +6 AB<br/>\nBless:\u00a0 +1 AB,\u00a0 +1 saves vs fear<br/>\nAid:\u00a0 +1 AB, +1 saves vs fear<br/>\nPrayer: +1AB,\u00a0 +1 damage, +1 saves, +1 skills<br/>\nGMW: +5 AB, +5 damage, +5 dr penetration<br/>\nHoly sword: Same as GMW + Holy avenger abilities<br/>\nDivine Might: +11 damage <br/>\nDivine Shield: +11 AC<br/>\nSmite Evil: +11 AB, +35 damage<br/>\nPower attack: +5 damage<br/>\nBull\u2019s: +2 AB,\u00a0 +2 damage<br/>\nBless Weapon: +1 AB, 2d6 damage vs undead<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nPlaying the character is a joy. It may feel a little slow early on with a starting strength of 15, a slightly lower AC from dexterity 8 and tumble only after level 22, but it soon picks up speed with the paladin buffs.<br/>\nI could have stopped CoT at 10 and had in undispellable Paladin, but this character works well even without the spells, so here I went for better saves and a stronger Divine wrath. The number of bonus feats would not have changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nTweaks: Epic toughness at lvl 38 is not vital to the build. You can take Cleave, Improved PA or some other combat feat instead if you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to comment and share your thoughts on the build.<br/>\n\u00a0</div>",

      "content": "<div>I really like this build Mick!<br/>\n<br/>\nIts nicely balanced in-terms of gameplay throughout the leveling which works well whichever module you are playing<br/>\n<br/>\nLovely synergy and creative use of the Harper Scout class!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd with a Base AB of 43 with all of those bonuses it isn't going to struggling to hit anything<br/>\n<br/>\nA small minor tweak<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>RE the comment on the starting strength of 15 - I thought about it because you brought it up if you did a Str 16 / Cons 12 starting stat split, you could have the same ending HP by dropping the alertness feat for Toughness then swapping a great strength feat for the an epic skill focus: listen to keep the same ending Str. Or you could use the Epic Skill Focus into Taunt, reduce the investment into taunt and put more into Listen.\n</details></div>"
