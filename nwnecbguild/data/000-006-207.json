Might as well imagine that Hin to be a lone commando, a survivalist that has learned many diverse techniques in order to operate in foreign grounds. To those unfamiliar with the tremendous advantages of being permanently immune to all mind-effects you can see them in detail in any of my kensai builds (Whirlwind of Steel/ Raigeki-the Lightning Strike), now add to that the AC provided from a max-dexterity Halfling with almost half a thousand hp's and you will be grinning in no time, like myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n Some of you might ask, \"why not a single kama in a warrior-monk build\" ? The answer to that is very simple, the kukris once they get some enchantments on them via UMD or other source are far superior to a single kama, far outperforming them in almost any situation. And we will have to thing about our good looks too, right? For all his merits though, he isn't without some issues, three that i am aware off in fact,<br/>\n<br/>\n * Hin-Hurricane has a (20%) XP penalty since he utilizes three base classes (one favorite), it might hurt some of you that want to play him in single-player modules. But then again it was never intended as such.<br/>\n * After all my builds that are heavy-hitters, this does feel like a woodpecker. You will have other answers like your traps and umd, but the fact remains that you want to get your hands on a pair of good kukris to take full advantage of what this build has to offer.<br/>\n * You can't be a true Ironman without ED and this Hin does not have it, to take real advantage of that very high AC. The solution here is to go with a (20/10/10) class split but it is not so easy as it sounds, although i am trying out different solutions to this.<br/>\n<br/>\n On with the build itself,<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:120%;line-height:normal\"><strong>Hin\u2013Hurricane</strong></span><span style=\"font-size:120%;line-height:normal\"><strong> </strong></span><br/>\n<br/>\n (MONK 25/ FTR 10/ ROG 5)<br/>\n<br/>\n RACE: Halfling<br/>\n ALIGNMENT: Lawful Neutral (Smite Proof)<br/>\n PLAYABILITY: PvM 1-40<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>STARTING/ </strong><strong>ENDING</strong><strong> STATS:</strong><br/>\n STR \u2013 11<br/>\n DEX \u2013 19 (<strong>36</strong>)<br/>\n CON - 14<br/>\n INT - \u00a0 14<br/>\n WIS \u2013 08<br/>\n CHA \u201308<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Hit Points: </strong><strong>450</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Skill Points: </strong><strong>270</strong>\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Discipline: 43 (43)<br/>\n Disable Traps: 21 (25)<br/>\n Hide: 43 (60)<br/>\n Move Silently: 41 (60)<br/>\n Open Locks: 7 (20)<br/>\n Search: 19 (21)<br/>\n Set Traps: 29 (45)<br/>\n Spellcraft: 18 (20) cc<br/>\n UMD: 31 (30)\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fort/Ref/Will): <strong>26</strong>/ <strong>37</strong>/ <strong>20 </strong>\u2192 <strong>30</strong>/ <strong>41</strong>/ <strong>24 </strong>(saves Vs spells)<br/>\n<br/>\n Naked/ Armoured AC: <strong>39</strong> (Clothes) OR <strong>44 </strong>(Expertise &amp; still plain Clothes)\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n SR:<strong> 35 </strong>(Cannot be reduced)<br/>\n<br/>\n BAB: 26 (Six attacks with Kukris)<br/>\n<br/>\n AB: +42/ +37/ +32/ +27 &amp; +42/ +37<br/>\n<br/>\n DMG: 1D4 +6 &amp; 1D4 +6 \u2192 15-20 X2 &amp; (3d6 Sneak attack)\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Spellcasting: UMD\u00a0Empty Body 2/ Day: 25 Rounds each concealment 50% (Undispellable)\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>LEVELING GUIDE:</strong><br/>\n 01) Rogue (01): Ambidexterity<br/>\n 02) Fighter (01): Weapon Finesse<br/>\n 03) Fighter (02): WP: Exotic, WF: Kukris<br/>\n 04) Fighter (03):<br/>\n 05) Fighter (04): WS: Kukris<br/>\n 06) Rogue (02): TWF<br/>\n 07) Rogue (03):<br/>\n 08) Monk (01): <em>Cleave</em>, <em>Evasion</em><br/>\n 09) Monk (02): Blind Fighhting<br/>\n 10) Monk (03):<br/>\n 11) Monk (04):<br/>\n 12) Monk (05): ITWF<br/>\n 13) Monk (06): <em>KD/ IKD</em><br/>\n 14) Monk (07):<br/>\n 15) Monk (08): IC: Kukris<br/>\n 16) Monk (09): <em>Improved Evasion</em><br/>\n 17) Monk (10):<br/>\n 18) Rogue (04): Toughness OR (Expertise for AC addicts)<br/>\n 19) Monk (11):<br/>\n 20) Monk (12):<br/>\n 21) Fighter (05): Great Dexterity I<br/>\n 22) Fighter (06): EWF: Kukris<br/>\n 23) Fighter (07):<br/>\n 24) Fighter (08): EWS: Kukris, Great Dexterity II<br/>\n 25) Fighter (09):<br/>\n 26) Fighter (10): Epic Prowess<br/>\n 27) Monk (13): Great Dexterity III<br/>\n 28) Rogue (05):<br/>\n 29) Monk (14):<br/>\n 30) Monk (15): Great Dexterity IV<br/>\n 31) Monk (16):<br/>\n 32) Monk (17):<br/>\n 33) Monk (18): Great Dexterity V<br/>\n 34) Monk (19):<br/>\n 35) Monk (20): <em>Mind-Effects Immunity</em><br/>\n 36) Monk (21): Great Dexterity VI<br/>\n 37) Monk (22):<br/>\n 38) Monk (23):<br/>\n 39) Monk (24): Great Dexterity VII<br/>\n 40) Monk (25): Armour Skin\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>SPECIAL NOTES:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n * Monk speed +180% (multiplied by haste effects)<br/>\n * Invisible to even the trained eye, super stealthy<br/>\n * Immune to all mind-affecting effects<br/>\n * Immune to all poisons &amp; diseases<br/>\n * Improved Knockdown<br/>\n * Improved Evasion<br/>\n * Uncanny Dodge<br/>\n * Epic traps<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><span style=\"color:#000000\">edit: per Hip 20161025 (corrections/additions of missing info, in</span></em><span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong> red</strong></span><em><span style=\"color:#000000\">); promoted final version from post #4 to lead; title change</span></em><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

SR reduced by 5 seems a worthwhile compromise to me along with scrapping 2 Grt DEX since a high-level caster will still penetrate 35 easily anyway. \u00a0Otherwise, you are right. \u00a0Using all the general epic feats for Grt DEX prevents any option for ED (or any other feats for that matter).<br/>\n<br/>\n DWing kamas would hit more often with 8 APR (9 \u00a0hasted, 10 w/FoB) and the monk progression intact; w/DEX 34 I got a +41/+38/+35/+32/+29/+26/+41/+38 progression with DW kamas (no haste, no FoB)\u00a0 \u00a0Admittedly, kukris offer more crit opportunities but only against mediocre ACs. \u00a0Else, kamas would dominate hands down. \u00a0Either weapon can be keened with scrolls.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n There must be some sort of roleplay issue you are trying to factor in (or qualify for some item or other prerequisite with DEX 36), and if that is the case, please detail it so an old man like me doesn't get more confused than he already is. \u00a0Have pity dear soul\u00a0<img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It's a form of dyslexia methinks... the eyes sending one message and the brain another. Doh! Can't get those old builds to assume their rightful priority I guess.

Kukris it is.\n<blockquote><div>\n * No way i was building such high Dexterity for an item qualification sir, i would be ashamed of it!<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n I had to check at least. The rash of recent requests based on item-farming has made me a bit neurotic about assessing builds nowadays. I hope you understand the origin.\n<blockquote><div>\n I was merely trying for my best AB on a build that has 30 levels of 3/4 BAB classes...<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n You've accomplished that much. I still feel it is important to point out any inherent cost(s) to sticking with a self-imposed build metric...\n<blockquote><div>\n ** On the other hand, i deeply fear you are right about the ED, it is just that everything would come 5 levels after, close to the end of the build.

It effectively compensates for losing the AC battle against high-AB attacks. Late-blooming or not, I couldn't pass it up knowing how drastically in-game combat performance would improve. The 20/10/10 split, kukris or not, is still the one I'd choose which I believe could be demonstrated quantitatively by comparing combat logs during testing.<div align=\"left\">\u00a0</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I highly suspect (if memory serves) that those \"discipline\" ranks were meant to be \"tumble\" instead, and that is what i would suggest. Hin-Hurricane would most likely be either totally immune to KD via UMD shenanigans OR have such high AC (more than 80 AC in a low-to-medium-magic world) that he simply does not need it. It is still useful if you have it, but if one toon can do without it, this is the case. Let me check AC for a moment. <strong>AC</strong>: <strong>83 </strong>[38 (base) +5 (Expertise) +11 (Ability buffs) +4 (Haste) +25 (+5 items X5 slots)] plus he will be improved invisible e.t.c. Oh, forgot Epic Dodge too... And that Hilarious Monk speed as well, heh... So, taking out 40 skill points for tumble, you still have (250 out of 290 in total) skill points left to play with, which is more than enough for the rest of his skill-set.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for the Index of Builds you are trying to make, i would appreciate it, if you consider as \"Default Build\" the second one, aptly named as \"Ironman Ed.\" since also you were the one that \"nudged\" me towards it. ;)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Today though, the build owner is the admin.\u00a0 It's a blessing for me when an author resurfaces to lend a hand towards the sanitization effort.<br/>\n<br/>\n Empyre's suggestion makes sense to me and if you can spare the time (and possess a modicum of mercy for the grey and gaunt) it will resolve the confusion well enough.\u00a0 It shouldn't take all that much time since you don't furnish a skill table in most of your builds anyway.\u00a0 I also recommend changing the title of the OP to match the \"preferred\" build (per \"Hin-Hurricane Ironman\"?)<br/>\n<br/>\n Once I've finished compiling the total backlog (it appears about 40-ish contributions atm) I'll revisit each one to see if an edit occurred in the last few months in order to synch the database release as accurately as possible. So you have some time.\u00a0 In 2-3 weeks, what can be gleaned will be finalized because my window will close as seasonal demands once again begin to dominate my time (from May to Oct I am an ECB apparition only).\u00a0\u00a0</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
