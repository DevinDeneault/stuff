When you're at character generation you have 30 stat points to distribute, with all attributes starting at 8. You use 1 point for each bump up to 14 (so 6 at 14), 2 points to move to 15 and another 2 to 16 (so 10 at 16), and 3 points for 17 and 18 (so 16 at 18). So you can see how quickly those 30 can get eaten.<br/>\nThen there are racial modifications, which are added or taken away after you've spent the points. With Dwarf, they get a +2 to Constitution and a -2 to Charisma. So when a Dwarf spends 0 points on Charisma, it starts with 6 not 8. Equally, when a Dwarf spends 10 points on Constitution, it starts with 18 not 16. That leaves you more points for other attributes.<br/>\nThen, in-game, you get 1 stat bump every 4 levels, and up to 7 Great Attribute bumps of 1 a time (I'm ignoring bonus feats for particular classes for now). So it's actually \"cheaper\" for a Dwarf to start with a high Constitution then boost Strength with in-game stat bumps than the other way around.<br/>\nOh, and in this particular case, you need to have a Constitution of 21 before you can take all the Epic Damage Reduction feats, and unless there's a compelling reason to do otherwise, you don't really want to leave a stat on an odd number, hence the 22 here.<br/>\nHope this makes sense!<br/>\nCheers</div>",

Keep your saves as big and brash as you can - you're a tank with this build, not an annihilator, and you can pound them into the ground nice and slow in between puffs on your cigar. Let some brash bugger come in and lop off heads in one hit: your job is keeping the feak and weeble from harm while relishing the satisfying clank of yet another helmet being crushed into a head. And it's actually better if you solo: you pull other enemies to you while taking out one or two in plain sight, so you can simply stay in Defensive Stance until they're all mincemeat. An awful lot of playing DwD is about patience - and 27/- DR is not to be sneezed at (and that's on every hit), so you can afford to take it nice and slow.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",
