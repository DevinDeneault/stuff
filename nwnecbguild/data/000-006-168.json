If you take the 12th Fighter level when you get a general feat, you could get Epic Weapon Spec on both weapons. You would lose 1 AB and 1 AC from the loss of 2 DEX, and another AB from the loss of 2 levels of AA (leaving a still-impressive 59 AB), but you would gain a net 3 damage on the bow and 4 damage on the sword.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">This build demonstrates the insanely high ranged\u00a0AB you can get from the Enchant arrow feat of the AA class.<br/>\nIt also demonstrates that you can get a very high Dexterity when a class has Great Dexterity as an epic bonus feat.<br/>\nThe high Dexterity enables a melee AB of 46, which is very good.<br/>\nThe high Dexterity also improves the AC and compensates in part for the lack of Tumble as class feat. The AC is better in robes (29)\u00a0than in full plate (25). Unfortunately, none of the classes provide Uncanny dodge.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelee is a serious back up plan\u00a0for this build.\u00a0You have TWF and Ambidexterity, but not ITWF. Called shot and Improved Critical are also feats to have. You can live well without Toughness and Iron will.\u00a0But you have to prioritize.\u00a0The 9 pre epic\u00a0Fighter levels only give you 5 extra feats.\u00a0<br/>\nI agree with taking str 14 for added damage\u00a0with the swords and with mighty bows. The wizard level let you use arcane scrolls and wands without UMD. You can buff your swords with GMW and Flame weapon for better damage. Stoneskins, Improved invisibility and damage shields can add to the melee defence.<br/>\nI agree with the other posters about adding the EWS feats.\u00a0EWS is ironically enough probably most useful for the melee weapon, since this is a dex build and since the\u00a0EA feat adds damage to the ranged attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the skills, I guess that concentration and discipline end\u00a0on 30 because of the last fighter Level at 27. A discipline of 30 will not help you much. With\u00a0most dexers you must rely on a high AC, rather than the discipline skill, because the skill will not be high enough even with full ranks.<br/>\nThe concentration skill will protect you against taunts, but not from taunters with a high skill.<br/>\nTumble is maxed x-class as it should be.<br/>\nI would have maxed Listen or Spot, maybe both if I had enough skill points to spend.<br/>\nYou seem a bit undecided about the stealth skills.<br/>\nIf you invest 13 points in Spellcraft\u00a0at Level 10, you will get a +3 to saves vs spells.<br/>\nYou spend 58 points on Lore and Heal. I would have put them elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall an archer build with great potential!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I would replace toughness with it in a heartbeat. Another possibility is to think when you are going to need to switch into your melee weapon(s), normally an archer would do that when he needs defence above all else. I would go with a rapier &amp; shield setup in that case and this way you can keep toughness as well as take rapid-shot &amp; knockdown so that you have something to do with all that AB. Or you can go all-out &amp; take rapid-shot &amp; Improved knockdown which will make your archer into a formidable warrior in both blade &amp; bow.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">A further thought ( hello, by the way!), that merely echoes some previous comments. If you take Ambidexterity an Two-Weapon Fighting at level 1 and actually dual-wield, you'd be starting with negative AB, and that can't be good. It'd be like flailing around blind with two spoons. These days, I wouldn't think about dual-wielding until just before or after level 10, when your AB is high enough to deal with the -2 to both hands without too much concern.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do understand that thematically excellence with both bow and twin blades is very Legolas, but there are more productive feats you can take at early levels to make life easier - such as PBS, Blind Fight, Rapid Shot - even KD or Expertise for when you're in melee.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I certainly wouldn't want to be in melee with a mage behind the mob with such a horrid Will save - and Iron Will wouldn't help much. I'd think you'd want to be doing the shooty stuff there, so maybe go bow before sword? (But that's just personal preference.)<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, and good to meet you!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Knocking down an opponent (which can only be done with melee) makes it harder to hit with a ranged attack. I'd take Point Blank Shot and Weapon Focus Longbow at level 1, and then Weapon Finesse, then Weapon Focus Rapier, then Weapon Spec Longbow, then Blind Fight and Weapon Spec Rapier, and then Rapid Shot at level 8. I would then move 2 Fighter levels from pre-epic to epic, and use that Fighter feat for Armor Skin.
