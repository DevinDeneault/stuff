The obvious way (right click the clot and look for the action from the radial menu) does not seem to work for me (the action icon is \"grayed out\" in the radial menu).<br/>\nMany thanks!</div>"

Quick slotting active feats/modes is quite handy.<br/>\nWhen reading different forums, I get the impression that people don't use counterspelling a lot. One reason is that it is not practical to use the radial menu in the heat of action.<br/>\nThere are situations where counterspelling has something to offer. As it is, most people probably rather dispel or breach.\u00a0</div>",
