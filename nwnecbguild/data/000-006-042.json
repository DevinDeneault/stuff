Critical he threatens the boundaries of illegal ammounts of power.<br/>\n<br/>\n And while many other characters have to sacrifice playability for achieving such ends, he does not. Extremly playable from the beginning to the end - he gets only stronger as you rise in levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n Solid Hp's, wonderful saves boosted from Moradin himself, many - talented with 250 skill points &amp; every combat feat you would dream off, he can take upon any task and will live to tell the tale.<br/>\n<br/>\n While there are many builds with this combination, none has the offense or the raw power of this one by far and he lack's nothing in return, a feat which i am very proud off!<br/>\n<br/>\n Enjoy the most dangerous of the Dwarves,<br/>\n<br/>\n THE DWARVEN WARMASTER<br/>\n (FTR 08/ ROGUE 10/ CoT 22)<br/>\n<br/>\n RACE: Dwarf<br/>\n<br/>\n ALIGNMENT: <span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>Any non-evil (</strong></span>True Neutral <span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>recommended)</strong></span><br/>\n<br/>\n PLAYABILITY: PvM 1-40<br/>\n<br/>\n STARTING STATS:<br/>\n STR - 18<br/>\n DEX - 10<br/>\n CON - 16<br/>\n INT - 14<br/>\n WIS - 08<br/>\n CHA - 06<br/>\n<br/>\n ENDING STATS:<br/>\n STR - 34<br/>\n DEX - 10<br/>\n CON - 16<br/>\n INT - 14<br/>\n WIS - 08<br/>\n CHA - 06<br/>\n<br/>\n Hit Points: 520<br/>\n<br/>\n Skill Points: 250<br/>\n Discipline: 43 (55)<br/>\n Spellcraft: 18 (20)<br/>\n Tumble: 40 (40)<br/>\n UMD: 32 (30)<br/>\n Set Traps: 23 (25)<br/>\n Disable Traps: 26 (30)<br/>\n Open Locks: 20 (20)<br/>\n Search: 30 (<span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>32</strong></span>, 34 <strong><span style=\"color:#FF0000\">underground</span></strong>)<br/>\n<br/>\n SAVING THROWS (Fort/Ref/Will): 36 /33 / 26 \u2192 42/ 39/ 32 (saves Vs spells)<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"color:#FF0000\">Add'l saves: Traps: +1, Poison: +2</span></strong><br/>\n<br/>\n NAKED / ARMORED AC: 20/ 31/ 41 (full plate &amp;

Take your Rogue levels from 12 to 14, from 17 to 19, from 23 to 24 and from 28 to 29 so that your modified ranks in\u00a0UMD update alongside\u00a0Tumble. Your charisma modifier is -2, you need to take that into account. The other levels can stay where they are as UMD is maxed out by then.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div>"
