fights and boss fights.\u00a0 Launch a Word of Faith to blind your opponents (no save) and then tear into them with your rapid attack schedule with an even further +2 AB because your opponent is blinded.\u00a0 For those big foes with low or no spell resistance, drop some Harms and Silent Harms.\u00a0 Use Craft Wand to keep a nice supply of Improved Invis, Invis and back-up Hastes.\u00a0 Summon Monster Wands are also useful as these can soak up IGMS from enemy casters as well as Bigbys and Ruins.\u00a0 Turn on Extended Regenerate to insure your hit points never get too low.\u00a0 Against your weak-Fortitude foes, you can even get away with an Implosion.\u00a0 You have UMD to use Arcane scrolls, wands and other devices, and your Divine Trickery power will grant up to +14 to your Search, Open Lock and Disable Trap skills (and your Stealth skills in general).\u00a0 For items, gravitate toward items which increase your Dex and Wis.\u00a0 Find the harmony and balance both these attributes bring.\u00a0 After that, Strength is next and then Constitution.\u00a0 Amulet of Protections for Natural AC, and Sun Soul boots, or any boots that grant Dodge AC.\u00a0 <br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Builder\u2019s Commentary</span></strong><br/>\nHe doesn\u2019t win any AB or AC contests.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t win any spell power contests.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t get Epic Dodge or deal tons of sneak damage.\u00a0 He doesn\u2019t win any over-the-top hit points or specialize in any one thing.\u00a0 He just wins.\u00a0 On the surface he doesn\u2019t look like much, but once you look under the hood you realize the little guy has quite a motor.\u00a0 In most Cleric Rogue Monk builds, the usual path is to achieve Epic Dodge, or maximum attack schedule, or HiPS, or the obligatory Cleric 38/Monk1/Rogue1 Imploder.\u00a0 This peaceful warrior does none of these things, but instead achieves balance in everything.\u00a0 He is equally at home in melee or ranged combat.\u00a0 He can enhance and augment his casting ability with Wands, Silence and Extend Spell.\u00a0 He can deal with traps, locks, detect the unseen, move fast with Extended Hastes (52 rounds) and 30% Monk speed increase, UMD all scrolls and other devices.\u00a0 He can stand in the midst of a fray bolstered by high AC and 50% concealment and still relax knowing that his saves are strong.\u00a0 His buffs cannot be dispelled unless stripped by Breaches or Disjunctions.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nOne of the things I found interesting is that this may be the first time I took a character\u2019s dexterity to 24 but then stopped short and didn\u2019t reach for Epic Dodge.\u00a0 Those builds have been done before, and they typically look something like a Cleric20/Monk9/Rogue11.\u00a0 In exchange for the signature Dex calling card, I instead chose undispellable buffs, longer spell durations, 2 cleric bonus feats, and earlier maturation of the Cleric spell progression, and a higher Wisdom for more spell slots and higher AC.\u00a0 There\u2019s nothing I hate more than playing a build that doesn\u2019t mature until Level 38-40.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nAdditionally, Rogue was taken mostly pre-epic to front load Trap and UMD skills.\u00a0 Rogue was not taken for Stealth skills at all.\u00a0 This is not a stealther (but with Trickery domain he can still do that unlimited if he so chooses).<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nThis build does reach some lofty ACs without stretching too hard.\u00a0 In playtesting through the PGCC, some of the higher AB folks were able to hit him from time to time 9(rarely), they were never able to threaten a critical.\u00a0 Something to consider.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
