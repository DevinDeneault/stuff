      "content": "<div>Hi guys, I'm in search of a build for this roleplay pg Idea.<br/>\nThe pg will be played on a 30level cap server, with long long time to reach it, so he must be character playable from 1 to 30lev.<br/>\nThe idea is a globetrotting boy, cleric or favoured soul of shaundakul, who goes around with his faithful big sword.\u00a0<br/>\nThe character must have at most three classes (3base class or 2base class +1PC) compatible with each other, it's for a roleplay server.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I could have as many\u00a0 skill points as possible (2-3 per level) to spend on roleplay skills.<br/>\nAt a technical level I just have a good damage output and a good AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp me! ^_^<br/>\n</div>"

      "content": "<div>Cleric of the God of Winds eh?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, Clerics do not need much help to be effective so something simple will work fine. <br/>\nTry Cleric 24/ Fighter 6 (Cleric 16/ Fighter 4 pre-epic), strength-based and you shall be fine. <br/>\nI am assuming Arelith server that's why I avoided single dips in other classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nMake sure you take spell focus/greater spell focus in evocation pre-epic, then follow-up with epic spell focus. Take extent &amp; empower spell as well. <br/>\nThe rest of your feats should be weapon focus in greatsword, improved critical, blind-fight, knockdown, weapon specialization, power attack &amp; cleave.<br/>\nIn epic levels, you should also take epic prowess, epic weapon focus, epic weapon specialization, armour skin &amp; great wisdom I.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttributes (Starting/Final):<br/>\nStr: 16(20), Dex: 8, Con: 14, Int: 12, Wis: 16(20), Cha: 8</div>"
