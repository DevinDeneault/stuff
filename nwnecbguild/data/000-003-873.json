My problem is that the monsters are set up so you can't solo, with excessive AC/AB bonuses and tons of immunities.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I've gotten a few tips and hints, I'm wondering. Is a monk relevant? As far as I can tell, you can make yourself a fairly untouchable monk by going dex/wis/tumble and cranking up the AC. Only trouble is that you'll end up with someone with extremely high AC (unhittable), but with low AB (not gonna hit nothing). So, what about a Monk/WM? I tried looking a bit but only found a very few builds which focussed more on cool stuff like max attacks/SR and such. How would a monk build look like if you want BOTH high AC and high AB and prioritize accordingly?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny tips? Please?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Monk is <strong>always</strong> good! Sorry, bit of a fan. Before handing you over to Empyre for proper guidance, it might be worth mentioning that Monk's AB progression with kamas (and fists) is -3, rather than everyone else's -5, so you will definitely stand a better than average chance of hitting outside your first flurry. Also, if you dual-wield kamas (you'll have to work out which other class suits you, but 9 levels of Ranger gives you Imp 2-Weapon Fighting for free) you can get up to 10 attacks p/round. So don't dismiss it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdmittedly, Dex-based Monks will largely be chipping away rather than flattening, but any hit can disrupt spell-chuckers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Empyre doesn't come back to you (particularly with one of his 100 or so excellent Order of the Wyrm builds), I'm happy to offer amateur advice!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I have stuff laying around like belts with +5STR or +5DEX, medallions with +6AC and +5Wisdom, boots of Haste with knockdown immunity, etc, etc. In general I can add an ability of +4 and an AC of +6 to any item in game using the Forge in the PW. I can also add +4 Save to an item, or +1 regenerat, etc, etc. This means that ... I'm not sure, but surely something. I guess it will impact some of the builds?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">More attacks might be useful after all. If you are only hitting on a 20, you have more attempts to get that 20. Also, with the Monk attack progression, each attack is -3 AB instead of the -5 you would have otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nA build with lots of Pale Master would give you the best AC, while a build with lots of WM would give you the best melee AB. For a good balance between the two, I recommend a Fighter / Bard / RDD. Ten levels of RDD gives you +8 STR to help with your AB and also gives you +4 AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, Stag, but I don't think that the Order of the Wyrm would fit here, but I'll tack one on at the end anyway..<br/>\n<br/>\nI looked through my folder full of builds and found several that might be able to be adapted for your pw.

I don't think you can do anything to solve both the AB and the AC problem if you solo. It's either TS spam or avoiding the boss. Arcane archers come in many flavours, and for this you'll need it as the major class to get enough AB to overcome the AC and the discipline check.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Alright, it's very simple to find the number of attacks from the BAB number.<br/>\nIf it is a level 40 build then you subtract 10 and then the number left indicates the number of attacks as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nUp to 10 BAB: 2 attacks (lowest it can go).<br/>\nUp to 15 BAB: 3 attacks (typical cleric, rogue, monk etc)<br/>\nUp to 20 BAB: 4 attacks (typical multi-class one of the above with a warrior class, or a pure warrior)<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that, Monks are a special case when they use their fists or kamas only (or their claws if they are in dragon shape).<br/>\nThe short answer is that they always add plus 2 attacks to the base BAB number and those attacks also come with -3 iterations instead of -5 that the rest have.<br/>\nFor example, pure Monk is 15 BAB then 25 BAB for a level forty build. Instead of having 3 attacks, when he uses his fists or kamas he has 3+2=5 attacks.<br/>\nThose attacks will follow a -3 iteration pattern as well, meaning more will hit, on average.<br/>\nLastly, there is also the option of \"Flurry\" that a Monk gains one more attack but ALL of them take -2 to their AB, which is commonly referred to, as \"Flurry of Misses\".<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the gloves, that's too bad man. <br/>\nProper Monks (Martial Monks that is) already get cheated of potentially two equipment slots (bracers, shield) and usually, the gloves are better than regular weapons to compensate for that reason, but those enchantments are worse instead.<br/>\nSome PW's &amp; Modules such as WoG, Aielund &amp; MotS do have special equipment for them but most don't.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

So if your weedy kamas aren't doing much, try giving the boss a slap - sometimes it works, believe me!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to Flurry of Blows: while it's generally, as Valerfor describes, a Flurry of Misses with bosses, it can be very handy with annoying mobs (and doesn't run into the same problems as circle kick) or big enemies like golems. So it's not a redundant feat (and, of course, you get it for free, so why not give it a whirl?).<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and if I'm understanding you right, Cornflower, you want to know whether Monk attack progression will be affected if you take fewer levels of the class. No. Whenever your BAB rises, so does the Monk UBAB and APR (which includes kamas), provided you're not wearing armour etc. Even with only one level of Monk - provided you're following proper Monk regulations - you're fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Sorry, ninja'd by Valerfor, but I think I'll let it stand.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Instead of having 3 attacks, when he uses his fists or kamas he has 3+2=5 attacks.<br/>\nThose attacks will follow a -3 iteration pattern as well, meaning more will hit, on average.<br/>\nLastly, there is also the option of \"Flurry\" that a Monk gains one more attack but ALL of them take -2 to their AB, which is commonly referred to, as \"Flurry of Misses\".<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the gloves, that's too bad man. <br/>\nProper Monks (Martial Monks that is) already get cheated of potentially two equipment slots (bracers, shield) and usually, the gloves are better than regular weapons to compensate for that reason, but those enchantments are worse instead.<br/>\nSome PW's &amp; Modules such as WoG, Aielund &amp; MotS do have special equipment for them but most don't.\n</div></blockquote>\n1. About the BAB. Do you max out the BAB if you add 4 Fighter levels pre-epic to monk? Would that give you 20+10=30 BAB and 6 attacks with -3 iterations? If so, Monk 25/WM7/Fighter8 would seem optimal to max out both AB and AC?<br/>\n1b. Is it worth it to make a F20 pre-epic to max out feats and AB/BAB/Attacks per round, then add 20 levels of monk? Or is that no good?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Yeah, gloves usually suck in a high magic PW, since most PW owners don't have the time/energy to create specialty gear. Basically, you just have to accept that as a monk, you'll never be badass.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I can see why soloing is going to be a tough ask!<br/>\n<br/>\nI would say that the very first thing your build needs is Haste. This is because it gives you the extra attack (at full AB), which lowers the AB you will need to hit enough times per round. However, from the high magic nature of the PW, can this be found on items?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe AC hurdle is also high - I suspect that this is why DD and DR is the common option, because you ideally need an AC of 120. Obviously that's why you like Epic Dodge, because that effectively lowers the bar. Concealment would be another benefit, although I assume the bosses have Blind Fight. Obviously you can get 50% Concealment by Monk, with difficulty also on a high Dex Character, but you can also get it by the Displacement Spell (and Improved Invisibility).<br/>\n<br/>\nThen we shouldn't forget debuffs. I guess the bosses have spell resistance and high saves, etc. but Curse Song will still work - and the debuff to their AC will also make the attacking job easier.
