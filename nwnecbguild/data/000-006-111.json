This is my Neverwinter Nights interpretation of Jan Jansen, and I've recently tweaked him a bit to make him both more characteristic and a bit more optimized. In the game, he was an illusionist, so to represent that I made him an Illusionist and took Spell Focus in Illusion, which is a pretty well-rounded choice, as it has some insta-death spells and a disabling one. Then I gave him Craft Traps, Craft Weapon and Craft Armor to symbolize his constant tinkering and obsession with gadgets and turnips, and his familiar's name is Turnip, just because it has to be. He's able to craft all craftable items in the game with no chance of failure (unless autofail on 1s is enabled). He also has 15 Pick Pocket to represent his attempts to steal Boo from Minsc when they're in the same party together. And 15 in Bluff because he was full of shit with his crazy stories LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause there are so many Mage / Thief NPCs in BG, it's hard to come up with different builds using the same classes, but considering his personality, even though he was a shady character, hence the choice of Rogue and SD as his 2 other classes, IMO he'd be more Wizard than sneaky classes. Plus, eccentricity often occurs in the brightest minds. Because he's a Wizard with HiPS, and he has his famous tinkered Crossbow, I don't see him getting hit that much, or using Damage Shields as a part of his strategy, so I didn't get him Epic Mage Armor or Epic Warding, but I did get him Dragon Knight, because he'd be the guy who would brag to everyone that he can summon an Ancient Dragon.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, being the OCD-tinkerer he is, he needed to have trapping skills to recover and set Epic Traps, and being so eccentric, he needed to have Max INT. He's a full-blown Arcane Caster with HiPS, Stealth Skills and Trap Skills to add to his combat strategy, and loads of turnips he can use in a pinch.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nLadies and Gentlemen, Jan
