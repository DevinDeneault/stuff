      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hello Sataricon - welcome aboard!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're just looking to play the Original Campaign (OC) expansions (Shadows of Undrentide and Hordes of the Underdark - commonly referred to as SoU and HotU), then you can expect to finish at around level 28. Should you wish to continue beyond that point, we can recommend some lovely modules, but that's up to you. What it will mean, though, is the difference between designing a build that gets the maximum possible from those levels and one that fully blooms by level 40. Your call.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, we're looking at a dual-wielder - but a nimble and dexterous one or a big-hitting strength machine? Or even a damage-soaking wall? I don't profess to know Clerics or arcanists well - others would be needed for that - but I might be able to assist with some of the melee classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to simply bat this back to you, but the closer we can get to what you're looking for the better we'll be able to give you what you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">In reverse order:<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the OC, which you should end up at around level 17 or 18, there's the Mines of Twin Summit trilogy (see Valerfor's thread \"New full Epic series of modules\" in the General Discussion forum for details), which will get you comfortably to level 40. You might also fancy the Aribeth's Redemption trilogy, which follows directly from the end of the OC and will take you to around level 28 (same as going SoU/HotU) before moving on again. You will need to be a male, elf, half-elf, or human, and of Good alignment for that one, but it does tie up some of the loose ends from the OC very well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter SoU/HotU (or the OC/Aribeth's Redemption), there's the Sands of Fate trilogy (see my thread \"Sands of Fate\" in the Modules forum), which again will get you to level 40 with time to spare.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then there's the mighty Aielund Saga (see Maximillian Kane's thread \"The Aielund Saga\" also in the Modules forum). This 4-part epic adventure takes you from level 1 all the way through to around level 37. It also has a compelling storyline and henchman who aren't just suicidal morons due to better AI. There are some changes from vanilla NwN, such as a modified spell system and no Devastating Critical (all detailed in the above thread), but still very much worth it. Vastly superior to any of the official stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll are available free from the Neverwinter Vault, and links are given in the respective threads if I remember correctly. One thing I don't know is compatibility with EE, sorry, I'm still using v1.69.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's a huge door you've left open as far as builds are concerned! All we've really done so far is rule out a dedicated archer. Let's try not to go Barbarian if you've done that already - time for something new. There are the classics, such as Fighter/ Rogue/ Champion of Torm, or Bard/ Fighter/ Red Dragon Disciple, for example. Then there's all sorts of variations on Monk, Weapon Master, Assassin, Dwarven Defender, Cleric, Paladin, Blackguard, etc, etc. Please help us, or you'll end up with wildly disparate builds - all of which could be great, but none of which might suit your preferred style of play. Honestly, the more precise you can get the better for all concerned.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
