I really like rangers and someone I play with said I should check out a lvl split of 25/15 any thought on that?<br/>\n Lvl 40 for PvP. Playability isnt a issue as one can lvl to 40 pretty fast. I am open to any weapon,race or play style. So just let your imagination run wild. Thank you for your time. Going Duel class for a slight AB increase.<br/>\n I did find this one but if anyone has another view on the 25Ranger 15Pally I would like to see it. <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build276571.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 76571.html</a><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Between Ranger &amp; Paladin there is a WIS synergy but nothing else and Ranger needs as many levels as you can get to work properly. Thankfully for you the Favored Enemies in a PvP arena are significantly fewer and you can perhaps afford to have only 5-6 of them. The build you linked from Tyr is good but i would change the weapon style and all because this build has no good AC for an arena fight. In fact let me re-shape it to a Ranger 23/ Rogue 2/ Paladin 15, take first level as a Ranger for more skill points, mix Paladin there as you see fit, take the two levels of Rogue only in Epics to keep your BAB to the highest. With your Ranger bonus feat take an additional FE and take Bane of Enemies (BoE) with a general feat. Starting with (STR 17\u00a0 DEX 09\u00a0 CON 12\u00a0 INT 14\u00a0 WIS 14\u00a0 CHA 08) you need three Great STR to finish on a STR 30. Final attributes should be (STR 30\u00a0 DEX 09\u00a0 CON 12\u00a0 INT 14\u00a0 WIS 14\u00a0 CHA 08) and your AC should be way higher.<br/>\n<br/>\n Pre-epic feats: Heavy armour Proficiency (Free from Paladin), Blind Fight,Knockdown/ Improved Knockdown, WP: Exotic (to get the good forging bonses), WF, IC, Expertise, Toughness.<br/>\n<br/>\n Epic feats: FE VI (Ranger bonus), Great STR III, EWF, EP, Armour Skin, BoE.<br/>\n<br/>\n For weapons i recommend either a Katana/ Dwarven Waraxe or a Scythe, all the damage from BoE gets multiplied on criticals as well.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Start as ranger as suggested then by a chance encounter of some sort this child of the forest is brought up by pallys. after awhile (the 15 pally lvls with a few ranger mixed in) he/she feels the draw of nature calling blah blah blah after some adventuring said character was a shadow among the woods striking down all evil and then fading away like they were never there at all. <br/>\n I know you lose the skill set of the rogue in exchange for hips the bigger lose (besides umd) is probably the feat swap to get sd in the first place.<br/>\n Just a thought.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Another very nice option since you do have some available feats is to take Extend Spell, this is very crucial for Paladin's spells and especially Divine Favor because an extended version of it will probably last you for the entire fight (20 rounds), so probably take Great Fortitude &amp; Extend Spell.<br/>\n<br/>\n Darknight's suggestion is also cool if you have the skills to take advantage of HiPS, which you will probably have with 14 INT. You will need Dodge &amp; Mobility for qualifying though.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Reason for that is that the 16th Paladin level gives you another second level spell slot that can be used for another extended DF (those +5/+5 bonuses are huge!), plus Monk gives you free cleave as well and also fits better due to the lawful theme of the build. Rogue it's probably still better though but we are talking about micro-details here, whatever you choose i hope you enjoy it.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

What is great about the server I play on, is I can lvl to 40 and then switch it all up and re-lvl. Well to lvl 1 that is and can not change my starting stats... I am guessing If I try the Monk route just throw it in at lvl 39 or 40? thanks to you both!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
