      "content": "<div>So I posted a build request for Yoda and got three different - but effective - variants: A Gnome Paladin (26)/Monk (9)/SD (5) [dexer with single wield kama], a Halfling Monk (21)/COT (12)/WM (7) and a Gnome Monk (11)/COT (10)/WM (19) [both single wield a Katana] . \u00a0I'm now looking for someone to threaten them.<br/>\n<br/>\n PvP (gotta slay them Jedi)<br/>\n<br/>\n Level cap - 40, playable all the way up<br/>\n<br/>\n Race preference - Human, Half Elf or Elf<br/>\n<br/>\n Class preference - At least 10 lvls of BG (he's a Sith)<br/>\n<br/>\n Melee preference - dual wielder<br/>\n<br/>\n Range preference - DEX archery<br/>\n<br/>\n Weapon preference - wields a two-bladed sword<br/>\n<br/>\n 8) Maximum item enhancement - +5 environment<br/>\n<br/>\n 9) Spellcasting - not necessary, but if he's a caster, he blows stuff up.<br/>\n<br/>\n 10) Custom factors - none,\u00a0 but would like AB of 40+ . . . Dev Crit if he can get an acceptable DC<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>I know, Darth Maul played by the rules, that's why he lost ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n In all seriousness now, what would you like this build to do exactly? Just having BG for theme's sake does little for the build and an AB of 40 is kinda low for PvP, moreover your AC without a shield in PW's other than WoG or Sinfar is going to be just average. Have you seen my Darth's Maul build at the 30's section, and if yes would you like it re-made for lvl 40 (it doesn't have BG though)? Sorry for all these questions but in PvP things are different and we can't know the specifics of each PW.</div>"

      "content": "<div>I have three possible solutions for you Fist,<br/>\n<br/>\n 1) My \"<strong>Darth Maul</strong>\" build for lvl 40, this one will have the highest AB from all, typical build of a FTR/ BARD/ WM.<br/>\n<br/>\n 2) My \"<strong>Death from one Thousand Cuts</strong>\" build for lvl 40, now this one will have much greater defense and the AB/ DMG will be high anyway due to the natural 42 STR.<br/>\n<br/>\n 3) An atypical build with \"<strong>Bard 17/ BG 13/ RDD 10</strong>\" that utilizes Divine Might/ Shield &amp; Bard Song/ Curse Song, to stay on the battlefield and slay his opponents. I might have to take 10 FTR lvls there instead of RDD if the feats aren't enough (dual-wielding).<br/>\n That build will have the least amounts of raw power but a very good buffing potencial.<br/>\n<br/>\n Darknight's Ranger idea is also very good.<br/>\n<br/>\n Tell me what you think,</div>"
