But, regardless, there is no actual need for it, as long as you know what you're doing and how it works. In other words, if you learn how to add AB, what counts towards cap and what doesn't, then you won't need the sheet, you will know what your AB is all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
