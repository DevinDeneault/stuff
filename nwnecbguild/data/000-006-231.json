      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Robbing from the rich, giving to the poor, and inspiring the Merry Band PvM (1-40) and PvP<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Alan A Dale, Wildwood Minstrel<br/>\nBy Tyr Templar*</strong><br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>Author\u2019s Note: </strong>This build, Alan-A-Dale (Wildwood Minstrel) is one of several characters in my \"Tales of Robin Hood (Wildwood)\" series which I kicked off in 2007; a number of members worked with me on various characters throughout the series (aka the \"Wildwood Gang\"); the Minstrel in particular being co-authored by myself and Tattoed Monk, with acknowledgments also to Grizzled Dwarflord, and it made its debut in the ECB on April 9, 2007. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn light of the patch, I have taken the liberty of breaking Alan-A-Dale up into two variants as follows:<br/>\n1) Ranger 25/Bard 15: Epic Ranger/Mid-Bard, in keeping with the original which sees Alan as a war veteran and loyal friend of Robin, returning from the front and joining Robin in the Wildwoods, having musical talent as well (i.e., a very good, well-rounded warrior with the gift of the song, hence epic ranger with mid-bard/\u201csweet spot\u201d in terms of the Song/Curse). Enjoys a really nice Natural AB 44, +2 Song: 46. +5 Curse: 51 / Buffed: 61 (-2 dual wield) and nothing short of wonderful damage output (STR-based, dual-wield, bolstered by Song -and- FULLY Bane charged as well). In addition to (non-dispellable) Ranger buffs, enjoys level 5 bard spell access (and bard entitlement to arcane items, etc.) as well; although the latter are subject to dispel, arcane access is always nice to have on a melee build for added flavor and versatility. While there\u2019s no such thing as too much saves, saves are good (even comes with his own clarity!), with a really decent skillset for a melee (including stealth) and a good defense (AC), especially for a SRT-based, dual-wielding melee (thanks to Bard Song, Skills, etc. though, with this AB/Damage, not exactly an issue since enemies just don\u2019t live that long!). Lacks nothing, really. <br/>\n<br/>\n2) Bard 24/Ranger 10/CoT 6: Epic Lasting Inspiration Bard (variant): this variant sees Alan as preferring the song over the sword, dropping the Ranger\u2019s Bane to pick up the Bard Song/Curse (Lasting) Power, but make no mistake about it: with full access level 6 bard spells (non-dispellable), high AB (47 Singing Only /Buffed: 59 + (your choice) either Stealth OR Taunt], and Song-Charged, Bard-Buffed, Str-Based dual-wield damage, over 400HPs and a really nice defense, Alan isn\u2019t some musician taking refuge in the woods but a seasoned war veteran and strong supporter of Robin, willing to do whatever it takes to stop the evil forces to help Robin and thus free the people, fighting faithfully alongside Robin in toe-to-toe melee in past and for as long as it takes, and against any and all who stand in their way. Not that Robin needs any help; er, on second thought, since Robin was bested by Lady Marion in an archery contest, beaten off a bridge by Little John with a stick, and dumped in the creek by Friar Tuck after taunting him, perhaps it\u2019s best that Robin has a good friend like Alan by his side and who, as the Minstrel of the group, has not just Robin\u2019s back but also his own and that of the entire Merry Band's. <br/>\n<br/>\nWithout any further ado, please meet:</div></blockquote>\n<br/>\n<strong>Alan-A-Dale (Wildwood Minstrel), Bard(15), Ranger(25)<br/>\n(Epic Ranger Variant):</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>I Attributes:</strong><br/>\nSTR: 16 (28)<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 12<br/>\nWIS: 14<br/>\nINT: 12<br/>\nCHA: 14 (15)<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman, Non-Lawful (Theme: CG)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>II Level Guide:</strong><br/>\n01: Ranger(1): weapon proficiency exotic, Weapon focus: kukri, favored enemy I, {Dual Wield}<br/>\n02: Bard(1)<br/>\n03: Ranger(2): knockdown<br/>\n04: Ranger(3): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n05: Ranger(4)<br/>\n06: Ranger(5): blind fight, favored enemy II<br/>\n07: Bard(2)<br/>\n08: Ranger(6): STR+1, (STR=18)<br/>\n09: Ranger(7): still spell, OR: extend spell*<br/>\n10: Ranger(8)<br/>\n11: Ranger(9): {Improved Two-Weapon Fighting}<br/>\n12: Bard(3): STR+1, curse song, (STR=19)<br/>\n13: Ranger(10): favored enemy III<br/>\n14: Ranger(11)<br/>\n15: Ranger(12): improved critical: kukri<br/>\n16: Ranger(13): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n17: Bard(4)<br/>\n18: Ranger(14): toughness<br/>\n19: Ranger(15): favored enemy IV<br/>\n20: Ranger(16): STR+1, (STR=21)<br/>\n21: Ranger(17): epic weapon focus: kukri<br/>\n22: Bard(5)<br/>\n23: Ranger(18)<br/>\n24: Ranger(19): STR+1, epic prowess, (STR=22)<br/>\n25: Ranger(20): favored enemy V<br/>\n26: Ranger(21)<br/>\n27: Ranger(22): bane of enemies<br/>\n28: Ranger(23): STR+1, favored enemy VI, (STR=23)<br/>\n29: Bard(6)<br/>\n30: Bard(7): epic skill focus: move silently<br/>\n31: Bard(8)<br/>\n32: Bard(9): STR+1, (STR=24)<br/>\n33: Bard(10): great strength I, (STR=25)<br/>\n34: Bard(11)<br/>\n35: Bard(12)<br/>\n36: Bard(13): STR+1, great charisma I, (STR=26), (CHA=15)<br/>\n37: Bard(14)<br/>\n38: Bard(15)<br/>\n39: Ranger(24): great strength II, (STR=27)<br/>\n40: Ranger(25): STR+1, favored enemy VII, (STR=28)<br/>\n<br/>\n*FE Note: All seven (7) playable races are your FEs in terms of PvP (Humans, Dwarves, Half-Orcs, Elves, Half-Elves, Gnomes, Halflings).

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Appreciate the question, Empyre. <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps I shouldn't have posted Alan as LI Bard Song/Curse power with the ranger's dual in the same thread as Alan as Bane-Charged Ranger with the mid-bard (song/curse) as yes that Bane Charged damage in the first one is something wonderful, isn't it? The +6 FE and 2d6 Bane (vs. 7 FEs, i.e., ALL Playable races, etc) on first variant, heh, that is the equivalent of not only WS/EWS but also and in addition a Greatsword in and of itself and on top of everything else, and doubly so (dual-wield), too! Add in the double kukris, song, STR-based, etc., with each and all of it (every damage point) also doubling on a crit as well. Alas, I feel your pain when adding all that up and \"comparing\" the first variant to the second , LI Bard variant in terms of damage output. Of course I say this in jest, but yes, it's true: Ranger Bane especially when Str-based, song buffed, etc. as above is pretty awesome, I must (humbly) say; then, as we discussed over on the Yardstick thread nothing delivers the damage better than bane-charged, strength based ranger (well, other than a Great Smiting Paladin), but next to that is the Bard, and especially true of Str-based bards with the lasting song/curse power as enjoys the second variant (with dual-wield, too!) such that the second variant shines on his own as well, similar albeit in a different way of course than the first one.<br/>\n<br/>\nFocusing on the song as opposed to the sword as compared to the first variant, yet similar enough in terms of the theme and classes of course (different representations of Alan-A-Dale, but both Alan all the same) so as to justify being posted in the same thread. That said, I do feel your pain (hey, you know me: I LOVE my AB/Damage set-ups, no doubt about that!), and believe me I tossed and turned about the possibility of fighter in second variant (although not dropping ranger for it, bear with me) for that very reason (which would have in turn justified a separate post), but decided against it for many reasons, theme-wise and build-wise. <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Fighter v Ranger:</strong>.<br/>\nEssentially, ranger gives us 6 feats on account of dual-wield, which if go fighter would have to chew 3 to get dual wield (which ranger gives for free) and would also if swap ranger for fighter mean a need to raise our DEX (i.e., dual-wield requirements, which don't apply to Ranger who gets dual-wield without the need of DEX). Plus, on top of that, in addition to dual wield for free (and without the need of DEX), ranger bonus feats are used for EWF, EP and Epic Toughness, being essential feats in the LI build--i.e., EWF/EP = 3 hard AB -and- ET = 20 HPs, thus just north of 400 HPs, thus meeting  minimum melee HP requirements (400 being the minimum), while singing for even more, which is nice, yes?. Beauty of Ranger here is that you're STR-based, dual wield, with no need for DEX, focus thus on STR (AB/damage, etc. as opposed to dual-wield requirements that would otherwise apply) with Bard Song/Curse (not to mention the skills, buffs, etc. on top of that) giving us not only more AB/damage, but nicely taking care of defense (saves, AC, etc), yes?  <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Skills Note--Stealth vs. Taunt:</strong><br/>\nI also really like stealth on this build, both theme-wise and build-wise (wonderful thing, really, defense and offensive-wise to have). That said, thought about poor Robin and the Merry Band who'd really enjoy not only our Bard LI Song/Curse power, but also Taunt--lowering enemy AC thus raising AB +6 (which doesn't count towards Bio-Cap), with target if i.e. a caster also suffering 30% chance of spell failure, and what's not to love about that?! Sure, stealth is great, but it's benefits are really for self only (i.e., soloing PvM/E, protection and tactical advantage also in terms of PvP). If caring for the merry band, being able to effectively taunt is something your party/team will rather love you for, in addition to enjoying its benefits yourself (and why it's an option). <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Quick Note-- PvP Considerations:</strong> LI Warrior Bard (melee) with the Bard ice (which bugs mages nicely), SC-5 (impr.invis) for cover, super taunting power for even more AB and causing arcane casting spell failure, with nice saves across the board (especially v spells!), real HPs and real AB 47 singing only (on the off chance a mage manages to shoot off say a mord's before you taunt, heh).  Some say I worry too much, and I can live with that. ESF: Taunt and ESF: Spellcraft not being so important PvM/E as say PvP. Still, having a truly effective taunt regardless of environment is rather nice (if dropping stealth, which is super nice to have all environs as well, with stealthy, ESF: Hide and M/S for that instead), and no such thing as too much saves either. For these reasons and more, build-wise and theme-wise ranger works best and along with bard are very important to this build. Besides, Alan lived in the woods, being a retired war vet with a gift of song which definitely connotes ranger and bard, yes? <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>CoT vs. FTR: Sacred Defense vs. XP Burden</strong><br/>\nAh, but what I was musing on somewhat in order to get fighter in LI bard variant while keeping ranger and bard as is (thus dual wield etc in tact) was swapping out COT for it, with FTR 6 if drop the stealth (which I like in this build) since taunt is a good option in LI variant as well works feat-wise: i.e., if go taunt option, can enjoy option to wear fighter's plate as desired (i.e., if/when not dual-wielding but sword+board, thus an option since, if don't go stealth path, then plate armor check penalties on stealth would become moot, drop AS in turn), with Fighter bonus feat along with the dropping of AS = WS/EWS (and there it is). Only problem with that, apart from the loss of CoT goodies (i.e., sacred defense--saves, and not just v spells, there being no such thing as too much saves in any event), and DW which DW is only once a day but nevertheless useful, since we are a bard (i.e., have CHA plus Eagle's for more), if playing this variant up PvM/E 1-40 would mean being hampered by XP burden, so not very playable despite getting LI practically right out of the epic gate on purpose for playability. Sigh.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>LI Bard Damage Calculations:</strong><br/>\nThen I looked at the numbers again, adding them all up as (in terms of Alan, LI Bard Variant) as follows, remembering also the typical fighter, who don't have any where near this AB, etc. either, much less Bard Song/Curse Song, etc, and which curse without more strips 34 HPs (damage) from all enemies in the area, depriving them all their skills, AB, AC, saves, etc. as well, without more, and without striking out with a single kukri either, which numbers when LI Alan, second variant strikes are as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Main: (23-27+ 3 Div x\u2019s 5 apr): 115-135, +15 divine (12-20/x2 crit.) <br/>\nOff: (17-20+3 Divine): 34-40+6 Divine (12-20/x2)<br/>\nRound Totals: 149-175+21 Divine (12-20/x2) </strong><br/>\n*(does not factor in any crits, or include any umd/weaponry). <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then I felt a whole lot better (sure, bane-charged epic ranger (first variant) is wonderful, slices through enemies like there's no tomorrow; but LI Bard variant be dishing the pain just fine alright, too!! <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Playability:</strong><br/>\nAnd last but not least, had I gone Ranger/Bard/Fighter of it, trading COT sacred defense etc. for fighter WS/EWS and in the process incurred a huge XP burden you, Empyre, wouldn't have liked it very much (I don't like XP burdens either, unless level 40 only, XP burdens are no fun and to be avoided, no arguments about that from me!). All fun aside, ranger/bard (whether bane-charged ranger/mid-bard -OR- LI bard/dual-wield ranger with CoT) makes for a great combination, both build-wise and theme-wise (lacks nothing).<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Announcement:</strong> Welcome Empyre to the Wildwood Gang. <br/>\nTime for an announcement, Robin Hood fans. Please be advised that Empyre has joined the Wildwood Gang and is working with me on what promises to be a super nice Harold (Wildwood Assassin) from the BBC Robin Hood series, and who will be joining the Wildwood series for your playing pleasure soon.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Mick, what are you saying? With all that damage (first variant especially, but second version, too),the dead don't strike back, eh?!  Seriously. Really nice (high) AB and damage, dual wield, strength based, etc., 7 apr and all. That said, AC here (both variants) is really quite good (for a str based build, and dual-wielder especially; in fact, as good as a Dex'er as Alan enjoys bard song/curse, cat's, etc. -AND- full train tumble, bring on the bard buffs for more such that AC is good). Said it before and will say it again: best defense is a strong offense always, and that Alan has in spades, yet a nice defense all the same, too; AC here is good--Song/Curse is like plate for free, and that's on top of everything else (don't need more AC). That said, Str based melee don't live on account of AC, they live by killing their enemies quickly. And in this case, enemies just don't live that long [first variant especially--bane charged, str-based dual wield rangers deliver the most damage  (next only to paladin smiters of course), especially when bolstered by bard as here, such that Alan slices through foes like there's no tomorrow. Melee Str.based bards are next, especially when dual wield as here. Playable on top it all, too, makes for a super combination. Proof positive and once and for all that ranger is anything but a tree hugger (even more deadly when add bard to ranger, or is that ranger to bard...LOL). Lacks nothing, really.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>AC calculations and comparisons:</strong><br/>\nHave Cat's (Ranger and Bard both, so lots of it), that's 2 AC right there; with Studded Leather (which is light armor) alone gives 5 AC, being only 3 off from Plate, but really no difference at all considering Alan has full tumble (unlike typical melee, only x-train, such that Alan enjoys more AC than typical fighter in plate right there and alone), with room even more DEX AC on top of that, too, such that it just keeps getting better and better. Remember, Studded has room for a DEX Armor bonus of 4 AC (unlike plate, which only allows for a DEX armor bonus of 1 AC); cat's alone gives +5 to dex (depending on roll, Alan has plenty--i.e., both Ranger and Bard both), so with a simple DEX item get even more AC no problem (and very easy to do). Now, on top of all that and in addition, have Bard Song/Curse, giving +7 more AC (+6 on first one), which is almost like getting Plate right there, and that's on top of everything else you already have (studded leather, Cat's, full tumble, etc., etc., etc). That's really good AC, especially for any STR-based melee build, never mind one that dual-wields!! Now, bring on the bard buffs for even more (haste, impr.invisibility (SC-5 best defense/cover in the game!), with second one getting not bane but a better song/curse (LI), achieving AC 43, hasted and SC-5 (impr.invis). That's self-buffed, not including any scrolls, etc. or magic gear either, which is really good, for a str-based dual wield melee build especially! Also have stealth (tactical advantage, etc.) on top of all that and in addition, too! Not that it matters; cuz with all this AB/damage, etc., it just don't: said it before and will say it again--the dead don't strike back, they just don't!!   <br/>\n<strong><br/>\nLeveling: wear med. armor early on, and can also use a shield any time you want, too. </strong><br/>\nAh, but like all things, there are the early levels, most true, not that it's especially difficult to level a str.based melee in the early part, cuz it's not. But until such time as your dual-wield kicks in, yes, you'll use a shield and wear medium armor, etc., most true (which medium armor = 7 AC with cat's, be it ranger's or bard's, being only 1 off from plate, not an issue, add dex for more). Can use big board any time you want in fact (when not sneaking around), so not an issue. Meantime, first-one, dual comes in nice and early, along with Ranger buffs and Bard for tumble dumps proper along the way, among other things, so covers off difference b/w plate and studded as above said right there, and more (with ability to add DEX for even more still, true); also, first one gets Bane in nice and early, heh, then bring on the sweet spot bard/song curse song right after. A beautiful thing, all the while slicing through enemies like there's no tomorrow (dead don't strike back dare I say once again, and a really nice AC in any event). In terms of the 2nd one, get bard buffs, song/curse in nice an early (by level 20, already in that one hit the \"Sweet Spot\" right there, your level 2 bard spells (major bard stat buffs like Cat's etc) in on level 4, level 3 spells (keen, haste, displacement, etc.) in by level 7, level 4 spells (impr.invis, war cry, etc.) in by level 10, complete and whole book follows right on thereafter, having the whole thing before hitting the epic gates, grab LI and get your ranger dual in from there such that, and once again, just not an issue, having a really nice AC already, such that no matter how you slice it (pun fully intended), ranger-bard (or is that bard-ranger) make for a dynamite combination, I think so and still do, too! <br/>\n<br/>\nBut since the LI Bard although more damage than typical fighter by far (not to mention really nice/high AB has Alan both variants, too) doesn't go for bane, felt it important to get all the bard goodies in early on this variant, including defense and of course early LI, as bards are a bit tougher in the early levels to level as compared of course to melee (i.e., epic ranger, first variant, which melee are very easy to level first 20, strength based and all, etc.), also true. But str.based bards are far more easy to level than Dexers (no damage, etc.) or mages (gotta wait on their DCs and all to kick in, etc) especially. However, and that said, with CoT in the mix pre-ep (hence BAB, warrior's fourth attack proper, haste for one more on top of that, etc. all such spells, and song/curse coming in nice and early, too), being Str.based, etc., heh, so not an issue there either. <br/>\n<br/>\nRanger-Bard (or is that Bard-Ranger) makes for a strong combination, indeed (and very playable, too)!. <br/>\n<br/>\nSing/Slash ON! ~ Tyr.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: remove typos.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Said it before and will say it again: AC don't matter when you kill things dead. I like my AB/damage set ups, always did. (AC don't kill things, AB/damage set ups kill things, especially AB/damage set ups like this!). Personally, love the ranger class also, and one of my favorite ranger builds was my very own Supernatural Hunter (Natural Born Killer), and a killer (all environs) he is and was;  Ranger/Fighter with a skills dump class (Naked AB 48 (-2 dual) on that one, bane-charged, covering off all 7 playable races, and str based as here), no where near the AC though as does Alan have here (no bard song, bard buffs, etc.) among other differences. Then, dead things don't strike back. Same is true here.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeantime, Alan here has even better AB than Hunter (Second one: 42+5 Curse: 47 singing only, bring on the non-dispellable bard buffs, or AB 59 (-2 dual), with your choice stealth or taunt; First One: Naked 46 (44+2 Song), +5 Curse: 51, add +4 non-dispellable Ranger buffs (Aid, Thirst): AB 55, stealth, with bard buffs for so much more), and thanks to Song/Curse more damage even on first one over the Hunter as well (and no where in here even discussing that we'll pick up even more still on cursing our enemies' i.e. tumble(AC) skills either, which like all of our enemies' other skills, goes out the window, too. Just beautiful!). But back to Alan's AC and once again, with that Song/Curse alone, far more AC than has a strength based melee build (both variants), never mind a dual-wielding one; add full tumble, our non-dispellable buffs etc. as said, and Alan's AC is very good (as in high for a dual wield strength melee especially). Hardly do we want to drop non-dispellable Ranger spells (AB, AC, Freedom, Grease, pet buffs, etc. etc. etc.) for a a point in AC (DEX) which we just don't need, as above said. Meantime, Ranger thirst, etc. alone equals 3 damage, x 7 apr hasted so that's 21 damage, double on a crit which factor be 12-20/x2 on not just one but two kurki, each and every single point of all our damage doubling on those crits (damage calculations set out in both variants, above, and we keen our own kukris, have our own haste, etc. too), such that and once again chew through enemies like there's no tomorrow. Not an issue in turn. <br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously. But that said, an AC 22 for a vanilla 29 in capped dex and padded armor or 32 with a shield you say? Oh, why stop there when you can have SO MUCH MORE as Alan here shows: <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst One (Epic Bane Ranger): <br/>\nV Defense Vitals (AC):<br/>\nAC (naked): 17, +3 Studded Leather, +6 Song/Curse: 26 AC, +2 Ranger's Cats: 28, can use a tower shield too, which gives AC 31. No gear, no nothing. (Bard buffs, that's AC 40, hasted, AND SC-5 (impr.invis), which is the very best defense in the entire game, and that's just self-buffs once again, no magic gear, no dex items, no anything else to which we are otherwise like all others of course entitled; bard class auto entitlement to arcane items, etc., too. Way better than a fighter in plate, on par or BETTER THAN a dexer in fact, and yet we're a dual wield strength based melee build! Not an issue in turn). <br/>\n<br/>\nSecond one (Epic LI Bard Variant). <br/>\nV. Defense Vitals (AC):<br/>\nAC (naked): 19, +3 Studded Leather, +7 Song/Curse: 29, +2 Bard Cat's: 31, add +3 shield: 34 AC<br/>\nSelf-Buffed AC (Bard, non-dispellable): 43, hasted and SC-5 (impr.invis). As above, these are self buffs only: no magic gear or arcane items, just what we do, and on a Str-based, dual wield, ... Now, bring on the gear (which once again like everyone else we are entitled to). Like I said, not an issue. It really just isn't. <br/>\n<br/>\nCan also wear medium armor (that's +2 AC more, both variants) when not dual-wielding, and agree one should when leveling in the beginning as discussed (and I wholly agree, great point to make and thanks), and use tower shield any time you want as well, as you want (which you can do when/if you want as well, so not an issue either). But that said, and really, dead things don't strike back, they just don't. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen, I like my Rangers tough and strong, and I like my bards tough and strong, too. And that's what happens when you bring the two together. So, no, it's not a stretch really. Just  built very good [thoroughly thought out, planned, tossed and turned over really, shaken and then stirred! And so very self-sufficient, I do ever so humbly say, too) (thanks, Mick!)]. Meantime, with all this AB/damage, heh, and again, wave bye bye to your foes: lacks nothing, and enemies just  don't live that long! So no worries at all.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSlash/Sing/Curse ON! ~ Cheers<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: remove typos.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">OK, going to share with you guys one more variant of Alan that I was considering, and will appeal to those thinking about engaging their Alan Epic Ranger variant in a little PvP especially, but with 3 Alan's in here (darn bards, artistic license, different depictions in the tales over the centuries of Alan in turn, it's hard to cover them all but with 3 variants in this thread, I do believe we have it all well covered .... LOL ). <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst one, epic ranger variant/mid-bard (including bard spell book) for PvM/E (very playable, versatile and self-sufficient, low magic especially--lacks nothing, and why I ran with it in turn). Second one, LI Bard Variant, both PvM/E and PvP, all LI bards welcome indeed PvP, and not a party/team around that doesn't love a good bard, especially one enjoying LI practically right out of the epic gate and which can take care of itself in toe to toe melee combat, which Alan of course does; with high AB and very good damage, epic LI bard song/curse and the good Bard's full book (non-dispellable), heh, more than capable of taking care of himself, indeed, thus well able to solo as well (and so versatile, etc. as well!).<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, as everyone here knows, I do really like my AB/damage set-ups and should come as no surprise I looked at another mixture (tossed and turned about it, really, I told you guys that I did!). Time to post it up, and do some comparisons. Here, run Ranger first, +1 BAB/AB with added benefit of grabbing Bane ASAP. Drop bard book (keep sweet song/curse of course, with arcane access as well), putting those CHA points into STR (+1 more AB/damage) and DEX (10, +1 AC) which, for playability reasons (no skill dumps pre-epic), makes sense. And there you go, Mick (you see, I'm posting this one for you--you get your DEX 10, however, I get my real au natural (non Mordable, forget about dipellable!) beautiful wholesome AB etc. in turn. You lose your pre-epic bard skill dumps and bard book (bard entitlement to arcane items in tact, so there you go, magic access on melee, which is nice to have, so no issue), but get your DEX 10. Dumps come in early (not waiting 'til level 40 for it, so a level 40 build here in turn that is also very playable 1-40 PvM/E). But, you know what they say, you can't have it all, and especially not when as here you aim for level 40 excellence aka Naked AB 48 (46+2 Song), that's WM-territory right there and on a Ranger no less! Add +5 Curse: 53 AB (Singing ONLY), and bring on those (non-disellable) Ranger buffs for more (and did I forget to mention fully Bane charged, song bolstered, dual-wielding STRENGTH-Based RANGER, all that damage doubling on a crit, thus slicing through enemies like there's no tomorrow, heh). Then, again, with Bard Song/Curse in terms of AC, etc. (being more AC dual wield in leather than has melee in plate with board, though we've right to use of big board any time want, too), it does seem that you can after all (you know, I do believe we've had this discussion before!  LOL.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThing is, and all fun aside, most warriors (who do not enjoy Alan's AB/damage set up) have DEX 8 (unless going WM, otherwise, no reason to raise DEX, plate not allowing room for dex beyond 1 anyway, not that warriors get plate on character creation/level 1 b/c they don't either; nor do they enjoy ranger stealth or ranger buffs (cat's, grease, etc.) much less come with a useful pet companion either! Still, those Str based melee are very playable, but not as playable as Str based Ranger, with stealth, spell buffs, etc. oh and did I mention a very useful pet?! Choose Panther or Bear. Both are good. Myself, I really do like the panther (a rip-you-apart rogue!) but for theme reasons, for those interested in theme-play, you'll likely prefer bear since Alan lived not in the jungle but the Wildwoods. ENJOY! <br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>Discussion--Caster's need defense, melee need offense</strong><br/>\nThought it would be helpful (for benefit of new members/players especially) to take a step back, compare Alan\u2019s AC with that of the typical melee, and also point out that it is typical (and expected) that melee have less AC than dexers, and do so for a reason. Strength based melee dish far more damage thus kill things far quicker than dexers, who have no damage, they \u201cDex-Peck\u201d instead, and thus got to duke it out oh so much longer in order to kill things, many going sneak-damage which is useless against crit/sneak immune things, like undeads, etc. and can\u2019t sneak that which detects them either (needing defense in turn, as things are drawn out for them, not to mention what happens to them when they get KD\u2019d either (ruins their day and but how) and why it is so many dexers go out of their way to try and get SC-5, which is very expensive, and yet among so many other things the good bard books brings as said, not to mention entitlement to arcane items (scrolls, etc.), for which access others go out of their way to train UMD, but which bards don\u2019t need!). <br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, dual-wield melee and two-handed weapon melee typically have less AC than melee who sword+board, same reason, more damage means you need less AC, since the dead don\u2019t strike back. That said, dual wielders as here (unlike 2-handed weapon melee) can pull out the big board for AC as/when they want anytime they want (as Alan of course can do here, too). Also, when melee get hit, doesn\u2019t ruin their day (why there are min HP standards in turn which standards Alan as melee proper not only meets but exceeds and which is important (minimum being the floor, not the ceiling), not to mention that getting hit don\u2019t interrupt melee\u2019s swing unlike i.e. casters, whose castings get interrupted when they get hit (and with the least amount of HPs among the classes/types, not to mention reliant on those spells to do damage, they of all things NEED defense/AC. (Caster's don't have traps like sneakers/dexers who by contrast can bide their time in stealth for something to trip or using that stealth to surprise foes (deny ac, etc., making up for lack of their AB cf. melee, and without which stealth benefits they don't hit so good), much less the power (AB/damage, etc.) of melee, and as such it's casters of all the types that NEED defense (that said, Alan not only enjoys a very good (high) melee AB, but also enjoys stealth, thus all those benefits as well, and on this one also has traps, meantime and also able to purge invisibility, etc., with other things like animal companion, grease, etc). With that said, and bears repeating: Melee are melee. They hit, they damage, and that's how things die at the hands of melee (only need AC, etc. if don't have AB to hit and/or no real damage to deliver when you do, which is why things are as they are, how it all cashes out, and which on this build AB/damage is hardly an issue, and this notwithstanding has a nice defense nevertheless). <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Most fighters have DEX 8! (Melee AC's compared):</strong><br/>\nTypical Fighter/Melee: DEX 8, x-class tumble (AC = 10-1 DEX, +4 tumble, +2 AS): Naked AC 15, add +8 mundane plate: 23, +3 mundane shield: 26 AC. <br/>\n<br/>\nFighter with DEX WM requirements i.e., DEX 13, x-class tumble (AC=10+1 DEX, +4 Tumble, +2 AS): Naked AC 17, +8 mundane plate, +3 mundane tower: 28. That's less than what Alan enjoys dual-wield in leather, all variants, including this one, whose AC up front and center is as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\nAC (naked): 18, +3 Light Armor (Studded Leather): 21, +2 Cat\u2019s, +4 Song, +2 Curse (lowers enemy AB): 29 (AC 32 w Shield);  *studded has room for 2 more AC from dex (a simple +3- dex item, picking up on Cat\u2019s for e.g.), or: AC 31 (34 w. mundane shield). <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, bring on the gear (entitled to same as all others have), enjoy your Ranger boni and spells (purge invis., grease, etc.) with bard entitlement to arcane items, etc. and did I mention a useful pet/animal companion (panther or bear) as well (not to mention that plate isn't granted to fighters on character creation either, meaning Alan's just as if not even more playable than any other strength based melee build, which melee builds in general are easier to level than other things as also has been said, only they don't come with  Ranger spells/buffs i.e. Cat\u2019s, etc., or stealth, much less do they get traps, a useful pet companion, or dish the damage like there\u2019s no tomorrow either!). Best defense is a strong offense always when playing a melee proper, and yet notwithstanding all this defense here hasn't been overlooked. </div></blockquote>\n\nWhat follows is Alan-a-Dale, Epic Ranger: War Vet variant.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

In addition to the ranger's good book, Alan enjoys arcane magic access (bard entitlement), which is always nice to have on a melee; this, along with a useful pet/animal companion, stealth and traps, too [which traps have been trained on this one to go with those great ranger scouting skills (especially nice on strength based, dual wield bane charged, etc. melee build!) = very playable in turn, with bane coming on super duper early as well!].

I am having trouble which to play really. Any Advice on which I should try? My server has PVP at lvl 40 and I do not get an animal companion   However with 21 ranger lvls I get HIPS (outdoor only). There is no perma haste nor magic shops to buy potions or scrolls, they come from players. Love the builds! Thanks for your time.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
