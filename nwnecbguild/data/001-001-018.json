      "content": "<div>Hi all. I am playing the Prophet Mod. If any of you have played it, and remember stuff, I'm stuck.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm at, in the Urlord Palandras Prophet Kings Tower.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have talked to a ghost. I have searched, scoured. I have killed everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll thats left is a locked door to a room that only a key will open.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have scoured, searched for that key, as maybe that room leads to other rooms, and or some important NPC, an or the Urlord, etc, that would let me advance the story, and or figure out what to do next.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have killed all the orcs, goblins, mushrooms, White Dragon, everything enroute to the tower.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only places I can go is the mountains, forest, Tower, caves, witch, the Elven city.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny other possible areas, the game either says that cant go that way yet, or that way is explored in another module.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo basically I have to goto Urlords Tower, find out whats going on at the tower, in order to advance the game, mudule, go to more places.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd probably that locked up room, is probably the key to doing that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo anybody know what to do, and how to do it?<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anybody help?</div>"

      "content": "<div>Found the key, seemingly hidden in bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut new, worse problem. At about 73% thru Part 1 module of the Prophet Module:<br/>\n<br/>\nCRASH.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the Urlord's Burial Tomb, there is a pool that when drink from it, you enter a dream.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the dream, find a cabin in woods, with people dead. Then find a Guy that help kill a werewolf in Black Wolf form.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen when you tell him that his family is murdered, go back to cabin, you find his family alive.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you try to convince the guy that he caught lycanthropy, and that he is going to murder his own family because of that, your given 2 choices.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. You can either fight, kill him.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. You can leave, and the guy murders his family.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter what I do, when I walk out the door, after that, it CRASHES, quits the mod, NWN game.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I reload it to try either the same thing an or different thing, the thing crashes again and again each time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is just no way to avoid the crash, bug, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI havent noticed anybody else having this problem, so its probably a EE problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd since I am on mobile device, there is no debug mode, and there is only uninstalling, deleting the Mod files and then re downloading, and re installing the Mod files.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd its NOT a Hak, or TLK, etc, in the wrong place, because if it was, I usually get a notice, error warning about that, when, if that's the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly thing I can think to do, since I am pretty close to the end of Part 1, I can find, read a walkthru, readme, to get the rest of the story of Part 1, then import the character into part 2. <br/>\n<br/>\nCharacter might be underleveled by 2,3,4,5 levels, and might miss out on the experience, treasure, gold, items, cutscenes, story, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then again started character at 6th level solo, when it recommends 8,9,10th levels for solo, and did just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo should probably be fine underleveled in part 2.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really hope I can either find a way to fix crash or import into and continue playing in part 2, as the module is pretty awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be a shame if didnt get chance to play the rest of the mod<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Oh Well.</div>"

      "content": "<div>So I imported into Prophet part 2, and even tho underleveled I killed a giant crab, then killed 33 to 67 Asabi Lizardmen, then:<br/>\n<br/>\nProblem cant enter Gothra's Lair to get from the cliffs to the Desert.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe entrance is thru, underneath, under, etc, a giant stone easter island like statue, head, that has its mouth open.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour supposed to walk thru that opening in the mouth, and follow a very extremely short path to the Doorway entrance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is Baldecaran's selection of Problematic tiles he used to build the module, make it so that in certain areas like the Elvej City, Shatterpeak Mountains, Gothra's Lair Entrance, etc, that sometimes cant step mini tile A to mini tile B, even tho click it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThie makes it so that even if, tho you have a unobstructed, direct path to the doorway, and you click on either the doorway, or a point very close to the doorway, that your character wont walk to the doorway, nor enter, go thru the doorway, because of that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter a clicking a Zillion diferent mini tiles, areas, etc, a zillion times, it was impossible to walk to the doorway, an or go thru the doorway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe end result was character STUCK, not able to goto thru the entrance, doorway, that was semi close by, in direct sight, view, big, ominous looking.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if dont go thru that entrance, which seems impossible to do, then cant progress, advance, go any further in story, mod, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo because of that. Have to quit, at least temporarily, and find a way to level up to about 13th to 18th level, then skip the rest of part 2, and go import into part 3.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe its EE enhanced edition, but these bugs, glitches, crashes, problems, etc, is making what is otherwise is, should be a great Mod, UNPLAYABLE.<br/>\n<br/>\nI dont know how the Mod voted best in Hall of Fame, with all these problems, unless previous versions of NWN worked with Mod, and its EE, not the Mod.<br/>\n<br/>\nSad such awesome potential with this Mod.</div>"

I dont have a PC<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I dont have a bluetooth keyboard yet for my Mobile Device<br/>\n<br/>\n3. 1, a couple, few, some, other people also having similar, almost same problems(except for the CRASH in Part 1).<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Dont Know if they using EE or if on Mobile Device, an or if have Keyboard, using WASD keys or not, but since they dont say, I'm guessing they have a keyboard, on PC, EE edition.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. The problem according to 1 person and Baldecaran that commented on the Mod, in the vault, is that its a Tile problem. Bakdecaran acknowledged that he could have used different better tiles, and that because he didnt, it could cause problems, but that he liked the tiles, and wasnt gona change tiles to fix the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo because of that, seriously doubt using WASD would work, even if I had a keyboard.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso if I needed to use WASD, then why is my Mobile Device working fine, isnt having this problem in other mods?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I dont think not using WASD is the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.</div>"
