      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Alright, so this is a build I put together for Arelith (Like all of them so far).<br/>\n<br/>\nDwarf, Any Non-Lawful alignment. TN or CN should work pretty well.<br/>\n<br/>\nPvM, mostly, although for PVP it should do fairly well against most melee'ers and any caster without Mord's.<br/>\n<br/>\n1-30<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 14<br/>\nDEX: 10<br/>\nCON: 16<br/>\nWIS: 16 (23)<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 6<br/>\n<br/>\nDwarf: (Darkvision, Defensive Training vs. Giants, Stonecunning, Hardiness vs. Poison, Hardiness vs. Spells, Offensive Training vs. Goblinoids, Offensive Training vs. Orcs, Skill Affinity: Lore)<br/>\n01: Cleric(1): Extend Spell, Domain Travel, Domain Trickery<br/>\n02: Cleric(2)<br/>\n03: Cleric(3): Knockdown<br/>\n04: Cleric(4): WIS+1, (WIS=17)<br/>\n05: Cleric(5)<br/>\n06: Cleric(6): Blind fight<br/>\n07: Cleric(7)<br/>\n08: Cleric(8): WIS+1, (WIS=18)<br/>\n09: Cleric(9): Spell Focus: Evocation<br/>\n10: Cleric(10)<br/>\n11: Cleric(11)<br/>\n12: Cleric(12): WIS+1, Improved Knockdown, (WIS=19)<br/>\n13: Cleric(13)<br/>\n14: Cleric(14)<br/>\n15: Cleric(15): Greater Spell Focus: Evocation<br/>\n16: Cleric(16): WIS+1, (WIS=20)<br/>\n17: Barbarian(1)<br/>\n18: Barbarian(2): Improved Critical: Scimitar, {Uncanny Dodge I}<br/>\n19: Barbarian(3)<br/>\n20: Rogue(1): WIS+1, (WIS=21)<br/>\n21: Rogue(2): Armor Skin, {Evasion}<br/>\n22: Rogue(3)<br/>\n23: Cleric(17)<br/>\n24: Cleric(18): WIS+1, Epic Spell Focus: Evocation, (WIS=22)<br/>\n25: Cleric(19)<br/>\n26: Cleric(20)<br/>\n27: Cleric(21): Epic Spell: Greater Ruin<br/>\n28: Rogue(4): WIS+1, (WIS=23)<br/>\n29: Barbarian(4)<br/>\n30: Cleric(22): Epic Spell: Hellball<br/>\n<br/>\nConcentration 33(36), Discipline 32(34), Spellcraft 33(35), Spot 30(36), Tumble 30(30), UMD 6(4)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 338<br/>\nSkillpoints: 164<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 21/22/13<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9, Poison: +2<br/>\nBAB: 20<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 22 (melee), 20 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 18/29<br/>\nSpell Casting: Cleric(9)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nNow- Why is this good? Barbarian doesn't get anything special, normally.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, on Arelith, you can get drunk. Getting drunk at first nets you with a light penalty to DEX (-4), for good STR(+6). AND once you hit Sobriety again (after 1 IG hour), you get +12 STR and NO penalty to DEX. So this build doesn't need ANY gear devoted to STR, at all, to max it. At least, once it hits level 17. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't have any Focus feats, because Cleric can more than make up for the loss of the feats with spells. Arelith is also changed so that with Epic Spell Focus: Evo, the Epic Spells you see listed multiply in power, quite a few times.<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned from my last character, CHA based Cleric's don't work so well, so I just said screw it. Travel for Haste, Trickery for Improved Invisibility. <br/>\n<br/>\nGear should be mostly just for stats, skills, and +1 on Boots/Amulet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAC with it's normal gear should be 10(natural) + 2 Armor Skin + 6 Tumble + 13 Fullplate + 8 Shield +1 DEX + 1 Boots + 1 amulet = 42 without anything but Magic Vestment. 47 with Extended Shield of Faith. 51 with Haste, and then all those fun spells that add extra to your AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's mostly caster, but could switch to scimitar/greatsword and just rip on things. Abuse that +12 STR. <br/>\n<br/>\n~Nok<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Why the 4th Barb level? If you get another Cleric there, you get +1 Wisdom (as an Epic Bonus Feat). I'd say to leave Barb at 2, but I know on Arelith you need at least 3 levels of a class in a row. I'd personally consider Cleric 24 (undispellable except with Mord's) Barbarian 3 Rogue 3 or even Cleric 23 Barbarian 4 Rogue 3, nearly undispellable, but less playable, as you'd need to start taking the Rogue levels way late in the build. I'd also drop some CON for INT for more skill points (UMD).<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
