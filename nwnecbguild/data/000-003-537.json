Also you need 4 pre-epic levels in a full BAB class to maximize your attacks per round.

I wouldn't try this in the OC or SOU/HotU, for example, but a PW that gives high experience would be fine.

And the build works out best that way.  I have played this build through the OC and on a couple of PW's with great success.  But Grizz will be the first to tell you, these are templates, not a bible.  There is always room for customization.<br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>Mithril Jack wrote:</strong><br/>\nYou need a weapon focus in a <strong>melee</strong> weapon (not unarmed combat) to qualify for COT.

I have done one for each race, except gnome (I consider them to be comic relief).  Each one seems to do great.  It does take some management, but that can be said with most builds.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   Finally, marshall, you have a good choice for a build there.  this is 'the' most versatile monk build I have ever seen.  As I stated above, I reworked some of the stats a bit and managed to get a version for all the races, except gnome.  One lvl in SD for the HiPS may or may not work out.  I just hope that Grizz or Din see this and can set thing straight.  The build is old, but still viable.<br/>\n<br/>\nDev<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The AC was out all night, and I had to deal with trying to sleep, while feeling like I was in a sauna.  I know I am right on that score though.  I have redone the build (stat-wise) for all races save the comedian of the game, the Gnome.  Din refuses to work with the monk, and I flat out refuse to use a gnome in a toon.  We all have our dislikes.  I think I have a half orc Zen Guardian on the server too.  Gotta break that guy out some time and see what he can do.<br/>\n<br/>\nDev<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
