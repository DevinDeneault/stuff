Mith's build was taunt divine shield and divine might.<br/>\n<br/>\n I was wondering if its possible to combine a build that will have both good curse song and song (the kind that gives you 5 ac and take 5 from the enemy) and also has divine shield and dev crit.<br/>\n<br/>\n ((so in shorts I need <strong>Bard Song((max)) - Curse Song((max)) - Divine Shield - Dev Crit))<br/>\n<br/>\n The build: can be level 40, needed for pvp, no need to take knockdown or still spell (you can reduce spell failure with gear) can change alignment</strong><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Of course this can be offset by your Bard Song/ Curse Song/ War Cry/ Taunt, so it won't be that big of a deal. It surely helps that you don't have to take \"still spell\" OR \"Knockdown\" feats as this build will already be feat-starved otherwise. Bard 26/ Paladin 4/ RDD 10 is the first thing that comes to mind, i agree but there is another choice you might not have think of it yet. Bard 16/ Paladin 4/ CoT 20 will give you yet another perk that relies on Charisma for ultimate synergy AND the ability to pretty much bulletproof yourself against anything that requires a saving throw. Divine Wrath bonuses will be +9/+9 and the duration would be perfect for PvP combats. If you\u00a0 want the undispellable for your Bard spells you could also go for Bard 26/ Pally 4/ COT 10 instead but that's for you to decide.<br/>\n<br/>\n Good luck &amp; welcome to the guild gotanp.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">This is a great build Val!<br/>\n It has enormous potential if you know how to play it.<br/>\n AB 41 may seem sub par, but when you add the effects of bard-/curse-song, taunt, bull's and GMW, the picture becomes a completely different one. Not to mention what happens when you peak with Divine Wrath and Smite evil. The defence is also taken well care of with insanely high saves, full tumble, self buffed cat's and Divine Shield. You can self buff dex , str, and cha, but rely on cha items to get full effect of the divine feats.<br/>\n Personally I prefer listen or spot over concentration, to be able to detect stealthy characters before thay attack, especially if your main spellcasting is out of combat. In a non Dev Crit build I would have taken Still Spell instead of Great Cleave. But that are tweaks.<br/>\n The only minus I can find are the two alignment shifts along the law-chaos axis. I definitely think you should post this build in the 40s section.<br/>\n<br/>\n Edit: Great picture btw. It would fit my Spirit and Steel build.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
