      "content": "<div>Hello! So I was fiddeling with the idea of a rouge who brings a lot of utility, as well as a lot of damage. Good in both PvE and PvP. The server is Arelith, which has a few special attributes mentioned many times over. The most important thing to know is that when a new class is introduced, you must take 3 consecutive levels of said class. Secondarily, Arelith is a low-magic server with some very high AC bosses. I apolagize in advance for the messy setup.<br/>\n I am looking for improvements, and oppinions to help me decide which of the two contenders is superior.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Human<br/>\n<br/>\n STR 17+2<br/>\n DEX 13<br/>\n CON 14+2<br/>\n WIS 8<br/>\n INT 14+2<br/>\n CHA 8<br/>\n<br/>\n Greatsword, relies on heavy armor in some scenarioes, cloth to sneak.

      "content": "<div>Hello Angua,  and welcome as a builder!<br/>\n<br/>\n If you want your character to \"Hit like a truck\", you have to focus on that. In this case,  that means to focus on building strength. To start with str 17 is a good start, but ending at str 19 is far from good enough. You have 7 ability points to distribute by level 30. You should also be able to take a couple of Great str feats and end with a strenght of at least 26. Compared to str 19 that will improve AB by 4 and damage by 6.<br/>\n<br/>\n The \"glass canon\" idea is not sound and will get your character killed every time you get attacked by a group of creatures. AC is necessary for survival. The only exceptions are if you have a high Damage resistance/reduction,  or if you can spam HIPS. What you can do here is to max the stealth skills and pick feats to improve them, so your character can use stealth in full plate. You should also take 30 ranks in Tumble and find room for Armor skin.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for your actual  build attempts, I see that your second build is illegal. You can only have 10 levels of WM pre-epic.</div>",

On Arelith, you can get +2 to some stats, at the cost of ECL. The plan for both is indeed to dump strength solely. Those posted are only the starting stats. I didn't go about creating either of them, yet, which is also why I didn't catch the second build having more than 10 WM levels pre-epic, which I am very glad that you did. This means that it can't possibly work, as I had intended. But the first build is still viable.<br/>\n<br/>\n I realize that glass canons are very tough to play, and no, HiPS is not an option. The character can switch between full plate and clothes, depending on the adventure she is facing. Additionally, she is not a solo character, and will mostly be paired with others. I simply wanted a rogue/ranger esque character who, along with her many utility skills, would be able to dish out formiddable damage in quick bursts. Arelith has a guardian feature that allows rogues to sneak attack with every hit, as the damage taken towards them is directed towards a nearby character who has choosen to shield the rogue.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'd be glad to hear your suggestions for improvements. I thought about using a rapier+shield over a greatsword, for instance, as well as picking up imp. expertise and armor skin.</div></div>"

Weapon max is +3, with +6 slashing/piercing/bludg., and +4 +1d6 elemental damage. In short, +12 cap on 2 stats is easily achievable, +3 is the best weapons get and UMD is, in general, very powerful.<br/>\n That aside, the guarding feature just means that tanky companions can shield squishy companions if they are close. I'd be glad for any example build you'd otherwise recomend. I can always change the parameters a little to fit the server. :)<br/>\n Edit: That came out really complex.<br/>\n Think of it as a 30-cap low-magic server with Dev. Crit. and HiPS disabled.\u00a0</div></div>"
