      "content": "<div>Hi eltalstro<br/>\n<br/>\nCool concept. Dual wielding dev critting half orc with a enrage ability! I like the AB 43 for sure. And of course 8d6 sneak attack with 6 attacks per round yes please.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition you have the option of letting out a huge real-life roar that can be heard throughout New Zealand, before your computer character engages the enemy!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn all seriousness I'm trying to understand the Eye of Gruumsh concept, is it the same as this one:<br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>Findaruil wrote: </strong>(<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/eye-of-gruumsh-concept-t2354819.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">eye-of-gruumsh-concept-t2354819.html</a>)<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe the class was installed with the latest CEP along with Shou Disciple and Purple Dragon Knight. Here are the characteristics:<br/>\n<br/>\nMax 10 levels, Hit die d12, Simple and Martial Weapons, Light and Med Armor, Shields, Skillpoints 2+Int<br/>\n<br/>\nPrerequisites: Alignment Chaotic evil, Neutral evil or Chaotic Neutral; Race Half-Orc or Orc; Feats Exotic Weapon Prof., Weapon Focus (Double Axe); BAB +6<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it gives you is an improved version of Blind Fight, an improved Rage (Str +4, armor bonus -4), +3 natural armor bonus, +2 saving throws and the ability to spit your stomach's content into your opponent's eyes (yes, that's what it says! :) )<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the answer!</div></blockquote>\nAs such I can understand your desire to obtain Improved Two Weapon Fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder instead of Ranger, if you would consider choosing either Fighter or Champion of Torm (chaotic neutral only) for the bonus feats to obtain Improved Two Weapon fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis would allow you to wear medium or heavy armor without losing dual wielding abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nFighter has the advantage of providing heavy armor proficiency, which CoT does not, an extra bonus feat at level 1 and weapon specialisation/epic weapon specialisation, great feats for a dual wielder.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will want some good armor on a character with a Dex around 14-15, and light armor might not cut it.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nCoT has no multiclass penalty and extra saves but no heavy armor. If you are leaving Dex at 15 then chain mail (5+2) or chain shirt with dex bonuses (4 +4) might be ok but full plate would probably be superior (8+1) AC wise.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could take a Fighter 14 / Rogue 16 / EoG 10 split with leveling. Rogue 16 for three bonus rogue feats<br/>\n<br/>\nThe extra rogue level can be taken late to minimise multiclass penalties.\u00a0\u00a0ie Fighter 14 / Rogue 15 / EoG 10, then F14R16EoG10 last two levels<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother option might be Blackguard, extra sneak attack, taunt, a summon, undispellable and stackable bullstrength, all the proficiencies you need, but you will lose saves with a negative cha modifier and you wont have all the lovely bonus feats from F / CoT<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also drop Wis to 8 and put Dex to 15 if you drop ranger<br/>\n<br/>\nI would swap slippery mind for improved evasion, and use UMD combined with lesser mind blank or mind blank scrolls to protect the will save.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaven't looked through some of the other things more in detail but happy to comment further as things go along<br/>\n<br/>\nHope these suggestions help</div>"

      "content": "<div>Thanks Orion,<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, Findaruil's summation of the class is a pretty good one. You make a lot of good points here. I absolutely took Ranger for the ITWF but also because I installed additional animal companions including a worg (which is actually weaker than a dire wolf). RP often nerfs my toons but so be it. I like the improved evasion call. I wanted that epic prowess from Ranger 15 so missed out on the Rogue bonus feat at 16. I thought about improved sneak attack or defensive roll but then just went for the +1 attack.\u00a0I also initially considered the BG option but the CHA issue seemed to make it prohibitive.\u00a0I'm going to try it out with Ranger and then give it a whirl with\u00a0Fighter 14 / Rogue 16 / EoG 10.</div>"

After NWN, NWN2 is my second most played game. It was a pity it didn't have quite the same online presence as the original. I thought it was really good and I managed to get the hang of the camera that people seemed to hate so much. The allowance for four classes meant you could make some crazy builds.\u00a0My NWN PW never changed over to it, and then the community kind of disappeared (although Layonara is still going). It would be really cool to get all of the additional classes from NWN2 in NWN. I actually reckon the EoG class is pretty decent after having played with it a bit. Full combat AB, blindsight to 10 ft (takes the place of listen skill), Blindfight, rage, a morale boost to saves plus a few other goodies are not too bad. It's definitely more of an RP class but the fighter, rogue, EoG that I'm playing around with is tearing through the Underdark with such reckless abandon I'm thinking about switching to hardest difficulty. If I could add some Frenzied Berserker levels Mephistopheles wouldn't have a snowball's chance in hell.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Eh, I find it hard to talk about NwN II, because it could have been so much better with just a few steps in the right direction, but it does indeed have many good things about it. For once, the polygon models in it have aged so much better than the NwN 1, ones &amp; there are quality enhancements too like feats remain active until you switch them off. It's from the same era of games that overused bloom effects so much, Oblivion did it too but at the time the graphics did look very nice indeed (In Oblivion's case especially.) But then, you had some questionable moves, like the overall nerfing of tumble/spellcraft skill, the elimination of time stop &amp; the shortening of available levels to just 30. It would still have worked fine until they decided to just ignore D&amp;D rules altogether &amp; advance BAB all the way to the end. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, you understand that nobody liked to lose potential extra attacks, so the multi-class combinations were restricted profoundly\u00a0 &amp; certain \"best\" combinations emerged without any room for tinkering or creative thought, such as (Fighter 12/ Bard 1/ RDD 10/ Weapon Master 7). Add to that, the kind of \"jerky\" animations that belonged more in an RTS type of game that zoomed into the battlefield (HoM&amp;M), instead of a real-time RPG like NWN supposed to be &amp; you kind of starting to form the whole picture. Moreover, the move of most PWs into some kind of real-life, role-playing type of game instead did not help either, I have seen some NwN II PWs that restricted leveling to just 12. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn secret, I wish we had most of the improvements NwN II had, but with the freedom that we have in the original game, oh that would have been brilliant, brother! <br/>\nAnyway, if you are still playing both games, then I suggest you take a look at this module by Tiberius, <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn2/module/maimed-gods-saga\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://neverwintervault.org/project/nw ... -gods-saga</a> <br/>\nIt's a masterpiece.</div>"
