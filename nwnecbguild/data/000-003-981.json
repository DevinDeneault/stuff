I think I've found you a good Ranger build: I'm just waiting on a question or two being answered.<br/>\n<br/>\nRanger would give you a full BAB, dual-wield capabilities and level 2 Ranger spells, as well as a couple of favoured enemies and a pet.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, does that sound like something you might be interested in?</div>",

      "content": "<div>Hello again. I got a few things wrong in my first reply (it's actually 2 spells from level 1, and no pet - that's at level 6), but I'd still say the Ranger option is a decent one. If you want to check the build I was referencing, have a look at the last few posts on Mick Dagger's thread, \"What makes a strong low level (1-10) build?\" in the General Discussion sub-forum. Of course, if his caffeine rush has come up with something new, all the better.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor myself, I'll confess that, while I appreciate the defensive merits of Expertise, I'd probably be tempted to go for something else - maybe even a second Weapon Focus, given Mick's edit, so that (particularly if undead are a major issue) you could have a slashing and a blunt focus. But that's just my play-style.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, have a look and see what you think.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

      "content": "<div>A 5 level limit rules out (most) prestige classes. No classes get +6 BAB which would grant one more attack/round. Monk/warriors can have one more attack with +4 BAB because of the monk attack progression with Unarmed and Kama. Dual-wielding, Rapid shot, Flurry of blows, Divine Power and Haste can also add an extra attack. Cleave can add a situational attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nLow magic usually means that self-buffing characters are best.<br/>\nHere magic is limited to lvl 3 spells for wizards, clerics and druids, level 2 spells for sorcerers and bards, and level 1 spell(s) for rangers and paladins. Level 3 spells means you can do with 13 or 14 in your casting stat. That makes it possible to have a high strength that gives a better melee presence. <br/>\n<br/>\nDruids get Wildshape, have an animal companion and can buff with Bull's and Barkskin.<br/>\nClerics start to get some buffs and can have Divine Power as a lvl 3 spell with Strength domain.<br/>\nBards have a level 3 song and can buff with Ghostly visage and Magic weapon.<br/>\nMonk/warriors can have 4 attacks with dual Kamas and Flurry active (and a 5th when Cleave kicks in), but the AB will suffer.<br/>\nRogues can craft and set pretty good traps. A warrior/rogue can have +4 BAB and 2d6 sneak damage.<br/>\nA specialist wizard can cast 2 fireballs, buff pretty well and be an all-right melee-mage if the strength is high.<br/>\nThe warrior classes can also do quite well, as long as they can dominate with high strength, full armor, martial weapons and combat feats such as Cleave and Knockdown. They will retain their effectiveness long after the more fancy buffs of other classes have run out.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: As for prestige classes, you can in fact take\u00a0 one or two levels of Palemaster\u00a0or one level of \u00a0PDK.</div>",
