Is there a certain multi-class I should go for, or is pure sorcerer/wizard just the best for this kind of thing. Also which spells would you recommend?\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You can even do it in a trainer mod. That way you get easier access to spells and new levels, and can focus on the technical part.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">One thing to consider from Mick's excellent advice is that if you wish to go the Sorcerer route, then his points 4 &amp;5 become even more of a priority. As you have limited spells, you need to make good spell choices in the first place (aka , Know your spells), and you need the metamagic feats to have more access to your damage spells and extend or simply move some spells to a level where you may have been forced to pick mostly defensive spells. You also get fewer feats than a wizard so I'd emphasise metamagic over spell penetration or spell focus (and then focus on either those (or something defensive? Got to be alive to be powerful *grin*). Which spells depend on environment ofc. <br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Just to add fuel to the creative fire,\u00a0Exalted is probably the penultimate example of a good Sorcerer build but\u00a0I've always enjoyed a different approach with a 29 Sorcerer / 1 Bard / 10 Palemaster. (Or a Wizard for PvM)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis provides a lot of different choices - Auto-Still Spell III with a Tower Shield and Scale Mail; higher CON or Higher CHA; Epic Damage Reduction, etc. It's certainly not as effective at breaching Spell Resistance though.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn regards to spells though, assuming no server-specific changes: Ice Storm and IGMS are your friends on a Sorcerer, more than they will ever be on a Wizard build. Spells like Flame Arrow and Firebrand are also \"good\" picks, but suffer saving throw dilemmas and Resistance/Immunity to Fire. They're best used on \"big dumb sticks\" who you know aren't going to make the saves, or aren't immune to the damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bigbys chain is alright too. Mestil's Acid Sheath and Elemental Shield are worth grabbing, as is the Spell Breach line with Mordenkainen's Disjunction to top it off.<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually include Greater Planar Binding, Finger of Death, Wail of the Banshee and Meteor Swarm in my own repertoire with the remaining spells selected as buffs (Protection from Alignment, Mage Armor, Improved Invisibility, Lesser Mind Blank/Mind Blank, Premonition, Stoneskin, Protection from Spells, etc) but your mileage may vary and it's highly dependent on if a server has changed these spell effects.\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
