It doesn't matter if they have a structure with few or no synergies. That only adds to the challenge of levelling the thing.<br/>\nSo here one morning - or was it afternoon? Well it definitely was afternoon. I had been looking at this forum and seen some of you toying with a dash of paladin within rogue builds. Then all of a sudden when I was half way down in my second glass of red, I found this old pearl from 2014. I judged it back then to not be something for the 40s section, but it was fun to play nevertheless.<br/>\nI want to share it with you and leave it open to comments and maybe even improvements - and maybe one day she will end up in the 40s, who knows?<br/>\nShe has a full paladin spellbook, full warrior AB, Epic dodge and HIPS. She can also set and detect epic traps and <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">open locks</span> gain entrance. She doesn't bother with such distractions as divine might, shield etc. You can still get a +5 to saves if you cap charisma.<br/>\nAnd please - don't tell me paladins can't be rogues or that paladins never used such things as traps. This is a rogue! and this is a halfling. Everything else is fantasy...<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease welcome the Holy Instigator!<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Paladin(20), Rogue(19), Shadowdancer(1), \nLawful good\nSTR: 10\nCON: 12\nINT: 14\n\n02: Paladin(1)\n04: Paladin(2): DEX+1, {Smite Evil}, (DEX=19)\n06: Paladin(3): Weapon Focus: Shortsword\n08: Paladin(4): DEX+1, (DEX=20)\n10: Paladin(5)\n12: Rogue(6): DEX+1, Improved Critical: Shortsword, (DEX=21)\n14: Paladin(8)\n16: Paladin(9): DEX+1, (DEX=22)\n18: Rogue(8): Mobility\n20: Paladin(12): DEX+1, (DEX=23)\n22: Rogue(9)\n24: Paladin(13): DEX+1, Great Dexterity I, (DEX=25)\n26: Rogue(12)\n28: Paladin(14): DEX+1, (DEX=26)\n30: Rogue(14): Epic Prowess\n32: Rogue(15): DEX+1, (DEX=27)\n34: Paladin(17)\n36: Paladin(19): DEX+1, Great Dexterity III, (DEX=30)\n38: Rogue(18)\n40: Rogue(19): DEX+1, Improved Sneak Attack I, (DEX=32)\nHitpoints: 362\nSaving Throw bonuses: Traps: +4, Fear: +2\nAB (max, naked): 44 (melee), 42 (thrown weapon)\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 30/32\nAlignment Changes: 0\nDisable Trap 12(16), Hide 43(58), Listen 43(51), Move Silently 43(60), Open Lock 19(30), Search 40(42), Set Trap 32(45), Tumble 40(51), UMD 36(35)\n\n02: Save(8), \n04: Save(5), \n06: Save(5), \n08: Save(6), \n10: Save(4), \n12: Disable Trap(1), Hide(3), Listen(2), Move Silently(3), Open Lock(1), Search(3), Tumble(3), Save(2), \n14: Save(10), \n16: Save(7), \n18: Hide(3), Listen(2), Move Silently(3), Open Lock(1), Search(1), Tumble(5), UMD(5), Save(1), \n20: Save(9), \n22: Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(6), Tumble(5), \n24: Save(4), \n26: Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(6), UMD(1), \n28: Save(4), \n30: Hide(3), Listen(3), Move Silently(3), Set Trap(6), UMD(3), \n32: Hide(2), Listen(2), Move Silently(2), Search(1), Tumble(5), UMD(2), \n34: Save(4), \n36: Save(12), \n38: Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Search(7), \n40: Hide(2), Listen(2), Move Silently(2), Open Lock(6), Search(2), </details></div>",

It originally started with a request from another member in the old Bioware forum who wanted to build a stealthy smiter. I was not able to build something that would work properly back then. I made some new attempts some years later, but soon dropped the smiter part for lack of synergies with charisma.<br/>\nI tried to build paladins with monk, CoT, rogue and SD. \u00a0I was still not quite satisfied with most of the drafts. <br/>\nI finally ended up with rogue because of the whole package with skillpoints, ED, UMD and SA damage.<br/>\nI have done this class combination with Paladin varying from 16 to 26 levels and both with and without SD.<br/>\nIt is a balance between skillpoints and SA damage on one hand and spellpower on the other. ED, UMD and stealth are essential.<br/>\nThis build offers a balance, but it is not set in stone.<br/>\nRogue and paladin do not provide the best synergy and it is often frawned upon for RP reasons. <br/>\nFor some it turns out to be provocative.<br/>\nThe title reflects that.</div>",
