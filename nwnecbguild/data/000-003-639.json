      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Many years ago, in the far eastern lands of Rasheman, a hero of legend, one Minsc, returned from his winter tour of duty rounding up and scolding wicked ice weasels with Boo, and carrying a strange load - a young, unconscious and dishevelled Half-Orc. The Wychlaran took the young one in to recover, and recognized him as part of a centuries old prophecy (\"At least,\" they breathed, relieved, \"it's not one of bloody Aulando's.\").<br/>\n<br/>\nIt transpired that the young Half-Orc had been out on his first barbaric raid, which had resulted in the horrific deaths of some family of elves by the name of De Tylmarand or similar. He had been horrified by the sight, and the glee his comrades had shown at the slaughter, and so had wandered away alone into the blizzard. Once he asserted he had vowed to never raise a hand in anger again, the Wychlaran knew he was the child of the prophecy.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor they had foreseen the coming of a presence to the northern Sword Coast of Faerun. A presence neither malign nor benevolent, but one who unwittingly sowed chaos and unrest wheresoever he roamed, at times accompanied by what appeared to be a small wyrmling. The Wychlaran knew that the only way to prevent the uprising of irritation that would engulf the Sword Coast from this so-called \"<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-epic-munchkin-wizard-33-weaponmaster-7-t2355422.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Munchkin</a>\", while protecting what was, in effect, an innocent life - albeit one strangely led - was having the child of the Prophecy of Patience travel with him on his dajemma, to both protect him and pacify the surrounding population.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Half-Orc was still unripe, however, and so the Wychlaran sent him to the Monastery in the Vale of Silence in the kingdom of Aielund to hone his skills in patience and persuasion, and then to the Temple of Ilmater in Kuldahar, at the head of Icewind Dale, to truly understand the concept of suffering - for he <em>would</em> suffer. Finally prepared, the young Half-Orc set forth to the city of Neverwinter on his sturdy mule with his stick in hand to clear brambles from his path, to go and become companion to this \"annoying bastard\" of a gnome.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here our story begins...<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>The Protective Pacifier</strong><br/>\nMonk 19/ Cleric 16/ PDK 5<br/>\nHalf-Orc<br/>\nAny non-evil, non-chaotic (LN, for RP purposes)<br/>\nL1-40 PvM<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Stats</strong><br/>\nSTR 12<br/>\nDEX 10 (12)<br/>\nCON 12<br/>\nWIS 12 (14)<br/>\nINT 8 (10)<br/>\nCHA 16 (22)<br/>\n<br/>\nHit Points: 405<br/>\nAC: (naked) 26 (refuses to wear armour, as it \"allows for the possibility of being hit\" apparently)<br/>\nSpeed +60%<br/>\nSaves: Fort 33, Will 31, Reflex 27 (he's very resilient.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">The legend of the Munchkin and his Pacifier has long been shrouded in mystery and legend, but the Epic Scholar (revered be his name) felt that now was the time to enlighten Faerun about the scratchy gnome and his smiling and gormless companion. The gods were smiling, too, and havoc was avoided along the Sword Coast (except on a couple of occasions when the Pacifier had a bit of a cold and stayed in bed, but we'll gloss over them).<br/>\n<br/>\nEven an irksome gnome deserves friends.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Oh, and it appears Tuff, the Munchkin's faerie Dragon, really likes being tickled under the chin and behind the ears - pumping out little clouds of delight. But only from his Half-Orc friend - everyone else is toast, should they approach. Or so legend has it. There are stories of a barbarian dwarven skald lass who journeyed with the legends for a while, but the tale of Glamrok is one for another day...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
