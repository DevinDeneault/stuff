He is a HoTU henchman who IMO has the worst possible build compared to his story. He fought in the wars between Devils and Demons, and he did so for SO LONG that he lost track of time. Not only was he a warrior, but he was also a general, an icon of evil, a relentless killing machine. Then Bioware staff make him a Fighter / Weapon Master. WHY? Well, first of all he has demon blood so yes, he is a fighter, but he's not a weapon master, he's a general, a general of demonic forces. What class can summon demonic forces to aid them? Blackguards! So I picked the Epic Fiendish Servant feat, even though summons is NWN are weak, just for RP. He has his own pet demon to help him fight. Now, he was also a general, which means charisma. He inspired his troops, which means Bard. He has a mild Bard Song, but enough to inspire his allies to give them that little edge in combat. As most of his story happens in the wars, the majority of his levels have to be of Blackguard, and Bard just comes in for skill dumps and a little Bard song. He also spent a great deal of energy trying to control his evil blood and tendency, so Concentration was also an RP choice, even though it does protect him against Taunts.<br/>\n<br/>\n My friends: Valen Shadowbreath!<br/>\n<br/>\n Blackguard(25), Fighter(12), Bard(3), Human<br/>\n<br/>\n Alignment: Any non-lawful, Evil<br/>\n<br/>\n Playability: 1-40 PvM<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 16 (32)<br/>\n DEX: 8<br/>\n CON: 12<br/>\n WIS: 8<br/>\n INT: 14<br/>\n CHA: 16<br/>\n<br/>\n Human: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n 01: Fighter(1): Power Attack, Cleave, Weapon Focus: Heavy Flail<br/>\n 02: Fighter(2): Expertise<br/>\n 03: Fighter(3): Knockdown<br/>\n 04: Fighter(4): STR+1, Weapon Specialization: Heavy Flail, (STR=17)<br/>\n 05: Fighter(5)<br/>\n 06: Fighter(6): Toughness, Blind Fight<br/>\n 07: Fighter(7)<br/>\n 08: Blackguard(1): STR+1, (STR=18)<br/>\n 09: Blackguard(2): Improved Critical: Heavy Flail, {Smite Good}<br/>\n 10: Blackguard(3)<br/>\n 11: Blackguard(4)<br/>\n 12: Blackguard(5): STR+1, Improved Knockdown, (STR=19)<br/>\n 13: Blackguard(6)<br/>\n 14: Blackguard(7)<br/>\n 15: Blackguard(8): Divine Shield<br/>\n 16: Blackguard(9): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n 17: Fighter(8): Improved Expertise<br/>\n 18: Blackguard(10): Divine Might<br/>\n 19: Fighter(9)<br/>\n 20: Fighter(10): STR+1, Great Cleave, (STR=21)<br/>\n 21: Blackguard(11): Armor Skin<br/>\n 22: Bard(1)<br/>\n 23: Blackguard(12)<br/>\n 24: Blackguard(13): STR+1, Great Strength I, Epic Weapon Focus: Heavy Flail, (STR=23)<br/>\n 25: Fighter(11)<br/>\n 26: Fighter(12): Epic Weapon Specialization: Heavy Flail<br/>\n 27: Blackguard(14): Great Strength II, (STR=24)<br/>\n 28: Blackguard(15): STR+1, (STR=25)<br/>\n 29: Blackguard(16): Epic Fiendish Servant<br/>\n 30: Blackguard(17): Great Strength III, (STR=26)<br/>\n 31: Blackguard(18)<br/>\n 32: Bard(2): STR+1, (STR=27)<br/>\n 33: Blackguard(19): Great Strength IV, Overwhelming Critical: Heavy Flail, (STR=28)<br/>\n 34: Blackguard(20)<br/>\n 35: Blackguard(21)<br/>\n 36: Blackguard(22): STR+1, Great Strength V, Devastating Critical: Heavy Flail, (STR=30)<br/>\n 37: Bard(3)<br/>\n 38: Blackguard(23)<br/>\n 39: Blackguard(24): Great Strength VI, (STR=31)<br/>\n 40: Blackguard(25): STR+1, Epic Prowess, (STR=32)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 468<br/>\n Skillpoints: 221<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 28/18/18<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses:<br/>\n BAB: 30<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 45 (melee), 30 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 19/30<br/>\n Spell Casting: Bard(1)<br/>\n Alignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\n Concentration 43(44), Discipline 43(54), Hide 5(4), Lore 1(6), Open Lock 1(0), Perform 9(12), Taunt 43(46), Tumble 40(39), UMD 30(33)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Discipline(4), Hide(2), Save(12),<br/>\n 02: Discipline(1), Save(16),<br/>\n 03: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Save(18),<br/>\n 04: Discipline(1), Save(22),<br/>\n 05: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Save(24),<br/>\n 06: Discipline(1), Save(28),<br/>\n 07: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Save(30),<br/>\n 08: Discipline(1), Taunt(11), Save(23),<br/>\n 09: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(26),<br/>\n 10: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(29),<br/>\n 11: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(32),<br/>\n 12: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(35),<br/>\n 13: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(38),<br/>\n 14: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(41),<br/>\n 15: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(44),<br/>\n 16: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(47),<br/>\n 17: Discipline(1), Save(51),<br/>\n 18: Discipline(1), Taunt(2), Save(53),<br/>\n 19: Discipline(1), Save(57),<br/>\n 20: Discipline(1), Save(61),<br/>\n 21: Discipline(1), Taunt(3), Save(62),<br/>\n 22: Concentration(8), Discipline(1), Perform(9), Taunt(1), Tumble(25), UMD(25),<br/>\n 23: Concentration(3), Discipline(1), Taunt(1),<br/>\n 24: Concentration(3), Discipline(1), Taunt(1),<br/>\n 25: Concentration(4), Discipline(1),<br/>\n 26: Concentration(4), Discipline(1),<br/>\n 27: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(3),<br/>\n 28: Concentration(2), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(1),<br/>\n 29: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(4),<br/>\n 30: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(7),<br/>\n 31: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(10),<br/>\n 32: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(10), UMD(5),<br/>\n 33: Concentration(3), Discipline(1), Taunt(1),<br/>\n 34: Concentration(3), Discipline(1), Taunt(1),<br/>\n 35: Concentration(3), Discipline(1), Taunt(1),<br/>\n 36: Concentration(3), Discipline(1), Taunt(1),<br/>\n 37: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(5),<br/>\n 38: Concentration(3), Discipline(1), Taunt(1),<br/>\n 39: Concentration(2), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(1),<br/>\n 40: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Lore(1), Open Lock(1), Taunt(1),<br/>\n<br/>\n So, he has full Taunt, full Tumble, UMD, Concentration and Discipline, plus an epic Fiendish servant to aid him in his journey. Devastating Criticals with an average DC will take care of mages. He's a complete fighter with high AB, IKD, Improved Expertise and Divine Shield to make his AC much more attractive. Give him some CHA gear and you won't even notice he's wielding a 2-handed weapon. As for weaknesses, the usual weaknesses of a meleer: low will saves, a little better than most for Dark Blessing, but not really much to write home about. All in all, a solid fighter build with many alternatives at his disposal.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
