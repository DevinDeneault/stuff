LVL'ing will be slow, rp will be consistent, the higher end of magic items are priced ridiculously and in general capped at +3 on arms and armor. Gods and domains are (in theory) required to be accurate for clerics.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack up and actually VERY active again. consistently seeing 20+ on it average and during pop times i've seen it hit 40's and I've not been able to check pop cap regularly! so looks like its back strong!<br/>\n<br/>\nSpecial rules I can recall(see links below for full list):<br/>\nonly 1 prestige class allowed<br/>\nprestige class can only start AFTER lvl 9(meaning the first level you can take is at 10)<br/>\nno Dev Crit<br/>\nCleric's (and most others when it comes to gods) follow a one step rule for Dieties(all right at the start are required to pick a god or be faithless)<br/>\nno monk/druid<br/>\nShadowdancer, shifter, Blackguard and Purple Dragon Knight are by application only I believe (as is rp'ing a red wizard of Thay)<br/>\nHarper class is guild only and AA is CAPPED at 10 levels<br/>\nThere is a farming rule: short version is you can visit a dungeon only a certain number of times per REAL LIFE DAYS per character. (multi characters? each can visit once per time frame)<br/>\n- Character levels 1 through 5 - 1 visit per day<br/>\n- Character levels 6 through 40 - 1 visit every 7 days<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nServer rules link <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://frc.proboards.com/thread/12048\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://frc.proboards.com/thread/12048</a><br/>\nCharacter creation rules link <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://frc.proboards.com/thread/12050/server-general-information\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://frc.proboards.com/thread/12050/s ... nformation</a><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
