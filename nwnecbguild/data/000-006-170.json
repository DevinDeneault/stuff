      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Barbarian-Pale masters are a somewhat unknown force in the NwN universe, most prefer the plethora of Fighter feats and the heavy armour. And truly they are hard to do since they have to be fine-tuned to the last detail to explore their capabilities in the fullest. Today i will present you with a Berserker that is perhaps the finest of his kind, he sits on 37 AC without any buffs with just mundane plate &amp; shield, has the highest AB of any other undead barbarian or fighter, comes with a complete almost three hundrend skill points set, all the essential combat feats and yes, it also delivers Devastating blows to his enemies while they run unable to resist his Terrifying rage that has a will save DC in the fifty's. You also get to enjoy my mediocre attempt at a short tale for him..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>THE TALE OF THE UNSUNG BERSERKER</strong>:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n...He wore eyes of pale that looked into nothingness and the once majestic armour was nothing but<br/>\n<br/>\n tattered remains that felt like they would crumble and fall off his grey skin. In his hands he wielded<br/>\n<br/>\n nothing but the grip of his trusted sword, the one that they put on his chest the time he died, nothing<br/>\n<br/>\n from the once razor-sharp edge remained, but he knew-he could feel it, that his skill and power<br/>\n<br/>\n would make this slab of iron deadly for his foes. Were others may cut, he would crush their sculls<br/>\n<br/>\n with brute force, for such is the power he was given from the grave...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n He stopped for a while and let the rain fall on him silently, he heared the sounds of battle once again<br/>\n<br/>\n and flexed his muscles preparing for the charge. The enemy was near... Fine, let them have it if that<br/>\n<br/>\n is what they want! And then he threw his head back for a moment and when he was back from that<br/>\n<br/>\n moment he let a warcry that shook the heavens with its intensity, and launched himself forward<br/>\n<br/>\n without a second thought... And the cries of his foes covered the battleground...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2013 Run, run for you lives!<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2013 No, mercy... please spare me!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeing from afar the lord of darkness sent his best warriors, one after the other and all of them would<br/>\n<br/>\nfail before the furious unknown warrior, such was his lust for blood, so great his blows that soon, <br/>\n<br/>\nnone could even dare approach him. And it was that time the dark lord, the scion of the dark realms<br/>\n<br/>\nthat choose to sent his best fighter to face this unstoppable  force of terror.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAll others stepped aside as the hooded figure approached the blood covered berserker, and as he<br/>\n<br/>\nmoved forward, he unveiled his instrament of destruction, a sight to behold. Red runes covered the<br/>\n<br/>\ncurved blade in it's entire length, a soft crimson  light emited from the weapon itself like it<br/>\n<br/>\nhad a soul of its own. And this fighter could stand the terror of the berserker and dare look him<br/>\n<br/>\nstraight in the eyes. They stood facing each other for mere seconds that seemed like an eternity, then<br/>\n<br/>\nsuddenly the hooded figure rose his enormous blade up and with a  masteful stroke he hit fast and<br/>\n<br/>\nhard on the berserker, delivering a blow that would finish any mortal foe! The strike from his sword<br/>\n<br/>\nshattered the armour in the place it hit and opened a big wound, blood gush forth for first time in<br/>\n<br/>\nbattle for the berserker. But he stood motionless, still standing, still grasping firmly his sword in his<br/>\n<br/>\nhands, and then he laughed, he laughed almost manically for the first time after years, finally<br/>\n<br/>\nsomeone has challenged him in equal terms! He laughed and then het loose his terrifying rage and<br/>\n<br/>\npropelled forward with unparalleled ferocity! And with a single reverse stroke of his dull blade he<br/>\n<br/>\nsevered the head of his opponent  from his shoulders, crushing entirely bones and spinal cord alike.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it was that moment that the dark lord realized the battle was lost...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the fight went on till the sun went red and the berserker was all-covered in blood and gore and<br/>\n<br/>\nnothing but him remained on the battlefield, and only then his rage ceased - for as long as a single<br/>\n<br/>\nenemy remained standing he could not let his mind take control. Then the golden general approached<br/>\n<br/>\nhim slowly, not neing sure herself if she was  safe to come nearby him at this moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2013 You should have stopped once I gave the call for it<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2013 You blew the golden horn and I answered the call as I am obliged to do so, golden general but the ways I fight are my own and mine only and I won't apologize for them<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2013 You are right of course, it was me that I called you from the realms of the dead, but I did not think<br/>\nthat you would make such a bloodshed, this is a scene macabre!<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2013 Victory is not pretty my lady..<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that, was all he said as he turned to leave once again returning to the lands beyond the mortal<br/>\n<br/>\nrealms, to the silence of the grave...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA hero that tales don't dare tell his story...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;line-height:normal\"><strong>DEAD-EYES BERSERKER</strong></span><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>(BARBARIAN 24/ BARD 4/ PM 12)</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n RACE: Human<br/>\n<br/>\n ALIGNMENT: Neutral Evil<br/>\n<br/>\n PLAYABILITY: PvM 1-40<br/>\n<br/>\n STARTING/ ENDING STATS:<br/>\n STR  - 18 (<strong>30</strong>)<br/>\n DEX - 10<br/>\n CON - 14<br/>\n INT   - 14<br/>\n WIS  - 08<br/>\n CHA - 08<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Hit Points: 482</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Skill Points: 277</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n Discipline: 43 (52)<br/>\n Intimidate: 43 (52)<br/>\n Listen: 24 (23)<br/>\n Perform: 10 (9)<br/>\n Spellcraft: 38 (40)<br/>\n Taunt: 43 (42)<br/>\n Tumble: 40 (40)<br/>\n UMD: 36 (35)<br/>\n<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fort/Ref/Will): 24/ 16/ 15 \u2192 32/ 24/ 23 (saves Vs spells)<br/>\n<br/>\n Naked/ Armoured AC: 26/ 37 (Full plate &amp; Tower Shield)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n DR: 5/ \u2013<br/>\n<br/>\n BAB: 30 (Four attacks)<br/>\n<br/>\n AB: +44/ +39/ +34/ +29 (Longsword)<br/>\n<br/>\n DMG: 1D8 +10 / 17-20 x2 (Longsword)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Devastating Critical DC: <strong>40 </strong>(46)<br/>\n<br/>\n Spellcasting: UMD full Ranks<br/>\n<br/>\n Terrifying Rage DC: <strong>52 </strong>+1D10 (Avg. 58)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>LEVELING GUIDE:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n01) Barbarian (01): Heavy Armour, Knockdown<br/>\n02) Barbarian (02): <br/>\n03) Barbarian (03): Blind Fight<br/>\n04) Barbarian (04): <br/>\n05) Barbarian (05): <br/>\n06) Barbarian (06): WF: Longsword<br/>\n07) Barbarian (07): <br/>\n08) Barbarian (08): <br/>\n09) Barbarian (09): IC: Longsword<br/>\n10) Barbarian (10): <br/>\n11) Barbarian (11): <br/>\n12) Barbarian (12): Power Attack<br/>\n13) Barbarian (13): <br/>\n14) Barbarian (14): <br/>\n15) Barbarian (15): Cleave<br/>\n16) Barbarian (16): <br/>\n17) Barbarian (17): <br/>\n18) Barbarian (18): Great Cleave<br/>\n19) Barbarian (19): <br/>\n20) Barbarian (20): <br/>\n<br/>\n21) Bard (01): EWF: Longsword<br/>\n22) Bard (02): <br/>\n23) Bard (03): <br/>\n24) Barbarian (21): Terrifying Rage<br/>\n25) Pale Mastrer (01): <br/>\n26) Pale Mastrer (02): <br/>\n27) Pale Mastrer (03): Overwhelming Critical<br/>\n28) Pale Mastrer (04): <br/>\n29) Pale Mastrer (05): <br/>\n30) Pale Mastrer (06): Devastating Critical<br/>\n31) Pale Mastrer (07): <br/>\n32) Pale Mastrer (08): <br/>\n33) Pale Mastrer (09): ESF: Indinidate<br/>\n34) Pale Mastrer (10): <br/>\n35) Pale Mastrer (11): <br/>\n36) Pale Mastrer (12): Great STR I<br/>\n37) Bard (04): <br/>\n38) Barbarian (22): <br/>\n39) Barbarian (23): Great STR II<br/>\n40) Barbarian (24): Epic Prowess<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>SPECIAL NOTES:</strong> <br/>\n<br/>\nImmune to Critical Hits, Immune to Sneak Attacks, Immune to Paralyse<br/>\n<br/>\nImmune to Stun, Immune to Hold<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Bard Song</strong> 4/ Day: +1 AB/ +2 Dmg/ +1 Fort/ +1 Will (Duration 10 Rounds each)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
