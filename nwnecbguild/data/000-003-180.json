      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">I'm joining Arelith with a big group of friends and we've mostly all chosen our preferred playstyles. I have a general idea on how builds go, but I don't know every last detail, and I'm aware that the smallest difference can be a major flaw in a max level build. My playstyle is lots of speed, preferrably with no weapon (unarmed). I like the quarterstaff too, but I've been told it's a really bad weapon on Arelith. Monk is the best choice for this playstyle, but I'm willing to try something wierd or different if that's possible. I've played Arelith before, and I know dying while grinding for exp can be really punishing (yeah, we're grinders okay &gt;&gt; But we do lots of roleplaying, even when grinding!), so maybe a class that's less vulnerable early in levels would work? If it's too sub-optimal, I can still go with the normal Monk build. As for races, I can play a human, a halfling, or an elf/half-elf. (I hate orcs and dwarves, they're ugly). For classes, I'll play anything as long as I get to have loooots of AC, but like I said, I prefer to be unarmed (which means no shield) so it'll most likely be a Monk build. Hope those who are willing to help out will find it to be a simple task.<br/>\n<br/>\n [EDIT]: By the way, something good in PVP! Specifically against any two-handed classes<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">My first question is:\u00a0 self-buffing or existing off what combat enhancements fall in your lap?\u00a0 (i.e. AB &amp; damage potential)\u00a0 Self-buffing effectiveness on a server is guided largely by resting opportunities and how comfortable a player is with spellcasting.<br/>\n My second question is:\u00a0 how valuable is UMD on Arelith?<br/>\n My third question is: stealth/DEX build or plain STR? Note: DevCrit will probably kick in very late in the build on Arelith if you are seeking that (I am assuming it is still a level 30 cap PW).<br/>\n<br/>\n Essentially, the only way to deal with high-damage, high-APR STR types (other than throwing Bigby's and IGMS at them) is to hit their weakness: AC.\u00a0 That means you'll need enough AB to assure lots of hits.\u00a0 Which leads to something like FTR or CoT levels to boost both BAB and APR.\u00a0 Locking yourself into unarmed attack means WM is not an alternative to achieve that high AB and crit enhancements. C'est la vie!<br/>\n<br/>\n Stunning Fist is another alternative if you wear enough WIS gear to raise the DC to an acceptable level.\u00a0 It is ineffective vs. high CON creatures and crit immunes (like PM10's), however.<br/>\n<br/>\n The choice between medium race and small race is: small +1AC/+1AB/2d6 dmg vs. medium d20 dmg (@monk16).\u00a0 There are also some skill advantages with small races. Pick your poison.<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">1). I don't mind self-buffers, but I don't often play classes that do a lot of spellcasting. I honestly don't mind having low-ish AB either, just as long as it's not complete garbage. To answer your question; I'm more comfortable with non-buffing classes, but I'm willing to use a class with spells so long as it's not an overwhelming amount.<br/>\n 2). UMD is still very valuable on Arelith. No one fights on Arelith without wands. However, I am going to be playing with a large group. Chances are, I won't need it if someone else has it. It's nice to have, but if there's a way I can get more AC by dropping it, I'd prefer to take that path.<br/>\n 3). I'm aware that a Dex build would be simpler. One of my friends, more experienced in building than I am (though still no expert), tells me that this build with Str would be terrible, and impossible. If it's true, then I can go the Dex build. If the Str build actually is possible, maybe we can look at them and compare to see which one I like more?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
