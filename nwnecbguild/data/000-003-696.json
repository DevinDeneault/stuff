Add more resistance with\u00a0a few cons / fortitude boosting items on top of it, good luck to those guys killing you. I thought this balanced the build a little nicer compared with taking more epic energy resistances.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt loses UMD and a little sneak attack, and the will and reflex saves are not quite as good.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe base AB is still 40. The Monk UBAB makes it better.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a soloist, this guy is almost certainly going to have clarity potions highly visible in the quickbar, no different to most non-UMD fighters. But give this guy an item with mind immunity, or that casts protection vs evil / lesser/greater mind blank and you are pretty much going to go into cruise control.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a party this guy is where he truly shines, with 728hp (capped at 968hp), buffed with will protectors as described above, buffed with bull's/cats, buffed with cleric bonuses / bardic bonuses, with evasion/reflex 23(28) he can dodge a few fireballs and tank those dev crits and implosion users, if he rolls a 1, just res this guy and he will be at it again.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nHis dexterity AC will be protected with dwarven defensive awareness I, and sneak attacks will be difficult against this guy with a both high spot score (listen is not effective, a successful spot check is required to stop sneaks from stealth), defensive awareness II (which gives flanking immunity, no sneak attacks from that) and a high discipline score to resist knockdowns if knockdown immunity is not available.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor style points he can also eventually use deflect arrows with a 95% success rate (DC 20) whilst tanking it up, the animation for that ability is simply awesome. Not that those arrows were ever going to damage him in the first place.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne can equip a kama by taking exotic weapon proficiency early on, or dropping 1 BAB for an early monk level (which increases saves in exchange), but fists have a certain style to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nPre-epic, damage resistant enemies (ie ghostly visage with +1 soak 5) might be a pain without monk gloves, but you can carry around a spare enchanted shortsword/handaxe to give these guys the smackdown then switch back.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr if you want to cheat the Order, just keep that enchanted shortsword/handaxe equipped whilst the Brotherhood is not looking (they will never know...) until they award you those gloves.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall the numbers look great, it looks novel, very difficult to kill, and enough AB to play solo, so I'm going to share this one with you guys, in fact, I might start play testing this soon.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAppreciate any feedback on suggested tweaks/improvements!<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Fighter(12), Dwarven Defender(26), Monk(2), Dwarf\nAny Lawful\nSTR: 14\nCON: 18 (22)\nINT: 14\n\n01: Fighter(1): Luck of Heroes, Blind Fight\n03: Fighter(3): Weapon Focus: Unarmed\n05: Fighter(5)\n07: Fighter(7)\n09: Dwarven Defender(1): Improved Knockdown, {Defensive Stance}\n11: Dwarven Defender(3)\n13: Dwarven Defender(5)\n15: Dwarven Defender(7): Resist Energy: Cold\n17: Dwarven Defender(9)\n19: Fighter(9)\n21: Fighter(11): Epic Energy Resistance: Acid I\n23: Dwarven Defender(11)\n25: Dwarven Defender(12)\n27: Dwarven Defender(14): Epic Energy Resistance: Electricity I, Epic Energy Resistance: Fire I\n29: Dwarven Defender(16)\n31: Dwarven Defender(18): Epic Energy Resistance: Acid II\n33: Dwarven Defender(20): Epic Fortitude\n35: Dwarven Defender(22): Epic Damage Reduction II\n37: Monk(2): {Deflect Arrows}\n39: Dwarven Defender(25): Great Dexterity I, (DEX=21)\n\nSkillpoints: 176\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +5, Traps: +1, Poison: +2\nAB (max, naked): 40 (melee), 37 (ranged)\nSpell Casting:\u00a0\n\n\n01: Discipline(4), Lore(2), Open Lock(1), Search(2), Spellcraft(2),\u00a0\n03: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Search(1), Spellcraft(1),\u00a0\n05: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Search(1), Save(2),\u00a0\n07: Discipline(1), Search(1), Save(6),\u00a0\n09: Discipline(1), Spot(12),\u00a0\n11: Discipline(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Save(2),\u00a0\n13: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(6),\u00a0\n15: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(10),\u00a0\n17: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(14),\u00a0\n19: Discipline(1), Save(19),\u00a0\n21: Discipline(1), Save(25),\u00a0\n23: Discipline(2), Spot(5), Save(3),\u00a0\n25: Discipline(1), Spot(2), Save(7),\u00a0\n27: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(5), Spot(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n29: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n31: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(9),\u00a0\n33: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(3),\u00a0\n35: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(7),\u00a0\n37: Discipline(1), Tumble(15),\u00a0\n39: Discipline(1), Search(1), Spot(1),\u00a0</details></div>"

      "content": "<div>Hail Empyre65! Thanks for reading through this build draft and commenting!<br/>\n<br/>\nImproved two-weapon fighting (ITWF) Kama is always attractive in a low monk build, particularly in a BAB 30 build dex build for those two extra attacks.<br/>\nNot only these are two attacks, the kamas free up the glove slot for something else, they can have flame weapon/keen edge/GMW cast on them as well.<br/>\nAs mentioned, a high Monk (16+) enjoys those powerful 1d20 fists plus all those other goodies.<br/>\nI enjoyed reading through your Order of the Stone Fist build, and thanks for linking it for me to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe ITWF Kama comes with downsides as well in this particular build.\u00a0<br/>\nTo implement them in this instance, it would cost either 4 additional pre-epic feats (weapon proficiency exotic, two-weapon fighting, ambidexterity, improved two-weapon fighting) or -1 BAB by taking Monk 1 pre-epic (to avoid taking weapon proficiency exotic) and the three two weapon fighting feats.<br/>\nThere is -2 AB on top of this for dual wielding, which if flurry of blows is additionally used, a further -2 AB, which drops that base 40 AB down to base 36-38 in practice.<br/>\nBeing tiny weapons, they make the character susceptible to improved disarm attempts, which with a large weapon, provide a +8 bonus to AB to your opponent (compared with -4 AB if this character was wielding a large weapon or was unarmed). In some ways, if you resist the improved disarm attempt wielding a tiny weapon it is better for your opponent, as they will continue to enjoy massive (up to +40%) boosts to the chance to hit you and critical hit you.<br/>\nIn certain environments (ie against undead) bludgeoning damage is more favorable than slashing.<br/>\nSome environments have rust monsters who can instantly destroy your equipped kama instantly if you hit them, whilst an unarmed monk will have no difficulty dealing with them.\u00a0<br/>\nOf least importance for this build with all these resistances, deflect arrows cannot be used unless you have a free hand, so a dual wielding kama monk will have this feat disabled.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I designed this fellow to tank for parties, providing the occasional improved knockdown and have enough AB to solo effectively, I chose to not go down this path and took more defensive pre-epic and epic feats. I believe the ITWF Kama suggestion has merit if one wishes to play a more offensively focused build.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one goes down this path for this build, I would drop LoH for exotic weapon proficiency, great fortitude/resist energy x2 for ambidexterity/TWF/ITWF, and four of the epic energy resistance feats to boost up dexterity so the character can compensate for the -2 AB penalty for dual wielding. I think this is a very viable option to the player and thanks for suggesting it.</div>"
