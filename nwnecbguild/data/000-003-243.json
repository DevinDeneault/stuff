(I think I might be taking the wrong feats.)<br/>\n Anyway, I was hoping to get help for a build that was viable in both Arelith, and Amia both have a level cap of 30. Arelith seems to have a restriction on classes (such as 3 classes then a new one can be chosen) Amia doesn't. I was hoping to make a swordsman, whom focused on a longsword, I was hoping for dual wielding but (a shield is also acceptable ^^)\u00a0 that might not be viable, anyone knowledgeable in this that can help? I don't think there are any noticeable changes besides that. I'd prefer to be human (if possible), but wouldn't mind doing an elf either.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thank you.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Would it be okay if you were specific on when to add the skill points (heal, tumble etc?)

Myself, i always use a simple rule of thumb to allocate skill points that i will tell you about it. I always take the indicated skill points only when they are class skills for the current class, unless the builder has indicated otherwise. In the above case i have shown that Spellcraft ranks are Cross-Class skill by including this (cc)* sign. Everything else must be taken only when it is a Class-Skill for the corresponding class. One thing, make sure you have 4 ranks in Intimidate by your third level (for entering WM) and you should be alright.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Was kind of curious, will the build work well if the scimitar is replaced with Longsword, or is the scimitar ideal?</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">It will certainly work well with everything but when we have so high an AB it's best we take a high-critical weapon such as the Scimitar Or a Rapier. Another good weapon to be used with a Weapon's Master is the Axe. The longsword is the middle road so to say, nothing bad about it, but if you want to bring a huge smile in your face, take the Scimitar and never look back, half of your hits (55% to be axact) will be critical hits with a keen weapon.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
