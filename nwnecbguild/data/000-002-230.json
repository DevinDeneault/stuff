Also, does the same apply to the +2 CON at level 7? I tried the wiki, but the answer seemed well hidden, if it was there at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks all</div>",

      "content": "<div>True enough, wise one! However, the point is now moot, as I was looking at constructing a Barbarian/RDD/Bard build and found that there were about 83,000,000 of them already out there, so have knocked it into the proverbial cocked hat. Strangely enough, my mind moved from Barb/RDD/Bard to Barb/Fghtr/HS to Barb/HS/WM and has now settled on WM/Fghtr/Rogue. Much of that is down to our earlier discussion elsewhere about WM and DD, together with wanting to try a melee build without relying on heavy armour (hence looking at Barbarian first), counter-intuitive though it seems. A sort of Conan type. I admit that taking Fighter instead of Barb seems a coward's way out, but I only did so because of the stupidity of a Weapon <em>Master</em> not being able to specialise in that weapon!<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, rambling on now. Will stick something on the Unfinished Builds section for you to shoot at soon!</div>",
