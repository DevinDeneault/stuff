      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">It depends on where you play and the custom settings. In default Neverwinter Nights, Listen is better than Spot, because it allows you to \"see through walls\".  You still can't target the enemy without line of sight, but you see them as though they were invisible. However, many servers have implemented a modification to True Seeing where it adds to Spot instead of auto-detecting the enemy. If that's the case, go for Spot.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
