      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hello, Gang! I got the urge to play my first paladin for NWN (persistent world) and brought up a fresh copy of Kamiryn's Character Build Calculator. So, I punched in the classes I will be using (paladin, Champion of Torm), and started to place them in the level progression column. However, when I placed Paladin in row 1, it turned red (illegal) right off the bat. It has stayed this way even after inputting my ability scores and race (human). I can take it out and start in row 2 and everything is fine, except feats are now off. I can't figure out why it says level 1 pally is illegal but is fine with every level afterward. Anyone got any ideas?<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">The reason you can plug it into level 2 is because a pally needs at least WIS 11 at creation just like ranger, druid and cleric.\u00a0 At level 2, there are no ability requirements for <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">any</span> class. The only way to bypass the minimum creation abilities is to take a class that has no such prereq like fighter, rogue, monk, etc. at Level 1 before the first pally level.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I put my Wis score in Int and vice- versa, so the worksheet thought my Wis was 10 and Int was 14. =P <br/>\n Thanks for providing the clue! =)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
