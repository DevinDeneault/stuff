      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Is there a particular reason why you chose BG other than to avoid the multiclass penalty as an elf? Currently the only thing BG adds is 3d6 sneak attack and stackable Bull's Strength since you don't invest in CHA or Taunt. Something like a\u00a0Monk9/Ass21/Figh10 would have enough feats for DC: Kama on top of your current build, although avoiding the multiclass penalty would involve juggling the monk and fighter levels. Going human would open up even more options while avoiding the multiclass penalty but that would require dropping Keen Senses.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks Mick and Yunim for your comments!<br/>\n<br/>\nRE AC I was planning for robes &amp; UMD to supplement with the Monk UBAB and Monk Speed, but light and medium armor are options. I wouldn't use Heavy armor wouldn't make sense with such a large investment in stealth and having a base dex of 16. AC can be increased with both dex and wis buffs with robes on, although the Wis 8 score means that at least +4 wis would be needed to increase the AC<br/>\n<br/>\nI like your suggestion to choose fighter Yunim rather than Blackguard, it grants 6 bonus feats and allows me to dump Charisma. I like the level split you suggested too. Dodging the multiclass exp penalty should be achievable. I'll have a look at reworking the build when I get some time.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
