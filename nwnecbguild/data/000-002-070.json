Int feats = 52.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeat modifier : Epic Spell Focus + 6<br/>\n<br/>\nspell focus +2<br/>\ngr. sf +4<br/>\ne sf +6<br/>\n<br/>\nHighest Int = 18 + 10 + 10 = 38 + 12 = 50 (RDD + 2) = 52.\u00a0 Ability Modifier +26<br/>\n<br/>\nWail of the Banshee - + 9<br/>\n<br/>\n10 + 9 + 26 + 6 = 51<br/>\n<br/>\nSo a Wizard with at least 9 levels of RDD, Epic Spell Focus Necromancy and all 10 Great Int feats with a starting Int of 18 will hit a final DC of 51, is that the highest?<br/>\n<br/>\nOr am I missing something?</div>"
