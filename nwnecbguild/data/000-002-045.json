      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks for the reply! The server I play on , big-time, limits what you can multi-class with monk. I'm pretty much limited to DD, WM, or divine champion. There are a few other, but by application only and I'd rather not bother with that. I do believe there are gloves with small elemental enhancements? I believe +4. Am I to believe if I went dex I would be going also weapon finese if I wanted to go with fists? If that were the case. Do I still want to place some into str for damage? Or keep it low and just pump up dex for ab/ac?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">That changes things considerably!<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, it is weapon finesse for fists.\u00a0 DD definitely, so you cannot be flanked and to help preserve Dex AC.\u00a0 I would not skimp on Str, but it doesn't really need to be pumped.\u00a0 Dex is your main here, followed by Wis because that AC cannot be lost.\u00a0 Also, Monk +1/20 combines with DD dr (for normal weapons).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">It's damage resistance. At level 20, a Monk successfully resists up to 20 points of damage from mundane weapons (those without enhancements). And don't forget a level 16 Monk gets d20 damage with their fists, so the strength becomes less of an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've done Monks/ Dwarven Defenders and Monks/ CoTs plenty of times (sometimes all three), both as strength and dexterity builds, some with kamas and some with fists. They can all work really well: it's all a question of getting to know how to play them differently.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
