Although, If viable (meaning it would work overall with some benefit) I was wondering if Shadowdancer could also be in the mix with it. Although, I'm not terribly good with builds so you might guys might think it's not worth it, so let me hear your thoughts ^^.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That makes our job a lot easier.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now thinking about Shadow Evade, you are a flanker. With 19 Rogue levels (10 d6 Sneak damage), you shouldn't fight head-on unless really unavoidable. So that bears the question, even though it has been beefed up, what will you use it for? I can only think of Archers and other Flankers\u00a0such as yourself. You're a halfling, so small size will make KDing harder, which means you should be the one attacking from the side or the back most of the time, not taking the hits.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for Hide and Move Silently, it's a good bonus, and definitely worth 5 levels, but no more IMO. I think these changes only make the spread above more appealing. 19 Rogue, 6 Fighter 5 Shadowdancer seems the best way to go. I'll try to build you something, although I don't know what skills are useful in Arelith. You can figure out the skills on your own, right? I'll do the basic stuff, but feel free to adjust it to your perception of Arelith useful skills.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'll post it when I'm done.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
