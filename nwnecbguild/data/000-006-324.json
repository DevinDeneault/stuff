      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">As usual lately I haven't had much time to look thoroughly at builds, but I see some flaws in this one that IMO could and should be corrected:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- The spread is far from optimized. Going RDD heavy is the worst possible choice in this class combo, you either go Bard heavy or Fighter heavy depending on what you want to achieve. If you decide to go Fighter-heavy, I suggest the F 28 B 2 RDD 10 spread. That one has enough feats to fulfill your wildest dreams, but is low on skill points and spell-wise it's null. If you choose to go Bard-heavy, then B 26 F 4 RDD 10 is best, but you won't have enough feats to get DWing without giving up something important. However, you can go Bard 9 F 3 RDD 8 pre-epic for 25 BAB and you take the 4th fighter level on a general feat level in epics for WS/EWS. You'd need more Charisma to cast all spells, and your Bard Song would be tremendously effective. You could get Lasting Inspiration instead of Lingering Song and you'd have many interesting skill alternatives at your disposal.<br/>\n<br/>\n2- You're taking 2 Song feats for 8 levels of Bard. Either you go for it like I mentioned above, or you don't, but wasting 2 feats on a lvl 8 Bard song is IMO very very bad.<br/>\n<br/>\n3- You have no Weapon Focus, why? doesn't +3 AB appeal to ya?<br/>\n<br/>\n4- Why waste skill points in Lore, Bluff and Persuade? I have played Aielund and still cannot find a good reason to do so..<br/>\n<br/>\nThere might be more stuff too, but this was the stuff I spotted. Guys, the lack of DevCrit is because it's banned in Aielund IIRC, right empyre?<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Bard is there to give me access to RDD, and additional levels are there for skill dumps. I might take advantage of some buffing spells and the Bard song, but they're gravy, not the focus of the build. The two RDD bonus feats are all I need, since I'm not specializing on any single weapon. I wouldn't know what to do with all those Fighter feats, so I took more RDD levels for the 2 AC points and for the D12 hit die.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had Weapon Focus (let alone Dev Crit) on a weapon, I'd feel obligated to only use that weapon, and I wanted to be free to use any weapon I found that was better than what I was already using.<br/>\n<br/>\nLore is there because I hate paying 100 gold to identify stuff, penny pincher that I am. Bluff and Intimidate are there to help me talk Dante out of fighting me in Chapter 4. I always really hate having to kill him. Besides, I maxed out all the skills I needed to and had some points left over.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Well, spam building is one thing!  I think this is the first of 5 or 6!   You have a different way of looking at the game, that is for sure.  Rdd20, wm8, WOW!  You will find that ECB is a guild for folks who want to MAXIMIZE the effectiveness of their build, so if you continue to build like this (and do spam postings!), you will find that people will start to ignore your posts, unfortuantely.  Players like Max, Kail, Hip, et al, are here to help (my role is to chastize and provoke FEAR!  LOL  JUST KIDDING!), and if people continue to ignore their help, i have seen them simply not help that person, even when they ask!  Just an FYI.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that said, if you have real solid reasons for your choices, then we listen!  We are not closed minded.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo suggest that giving up 10 levels for 2 AC is the reason however, is not sound!  10 levels is HUGE!  It is the difference between a lvl 30 and lv 40 build!  The d12 is nice, but in nearly 8 years of building, I rarely, if ever took a class simply for HP!  Bard and songs give much more than loosing 10 lvls to rdd.  Even taking 4 fighter lvls in Epic gives more!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Your bardsong (and cursesong) alone will make it easier. Your hitrate will improve and thus your need for hitpoints will lessen. All spreads with these particular classes will be more powerful with RDD10. If you want those 2 feats, go fighter16/Bard14.</div></blockquote>\nGrim, he is stuck in beginner-land, where HP are king!  People are TERRIFIED to make a character with 8 Con, something which i have done more than enough times in my life.  For some reason, they feel that HP = security!  Funny, rolling 1 vs dev crit kills you with 1000 hp or 10 hp!  I know Kail LOVES his skills, but being a cleric guy, i have learned to make due with 10 intelligence and 2 or 3 skills per level.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMIN/MAXER to the CORE!     *yes, i even made ONLY Half-orcs in the last years of my playing career in order for the extreme challenge..RIGHT!

Bloond and Faith is pure Cleric lvl 1-20 which is very playable and then, exactly when its needed since the buffs have capped begins pumping its melee prowess through bard(tumble and umd access) and RDD. That build is made to be played from the ground up and it never stops improving.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You mean that Mith's Blood &amp; Faith doesn't suit your needs, but THIS ONE does? Seriously, after this remark I'd be very inclined to say that you aren't playing it right. Read my Cleric guide and try playing the build following my guidelines, then you tell me if it doesn't fit your needs. If it still doesn't, then there is DEFINITELY something you're doing wrong. I'm not trying to put you down or anything like that, but to put you in the right perspective of things. This is a guild where the people who know THE MOST about NWN break their heads to come up with the most optimized and refined characters they can conceive. Among the NUMEROUS EXCELLENT BUILDS that the members of this guild have provided us with, Mith's Blood &amp; Faith is a CONSENSUS ONE OF THE BEST BUILDS EVER TO HAVE BEEN MADE in this guild. And I don't think that if there ever came to be a Hall of Fame in this guild, anyone would dispute that it would deserve a place there. Just so you know what I'm saying, in a +5 environment, that build could reach 68 AB ON ITS OWN, and a very good AC too.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
