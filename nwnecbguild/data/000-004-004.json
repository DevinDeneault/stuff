      "content": "<div>This is really a well built strength based assassin for a level 20 environment. The AB, fort saves and hitpoints are high for a rogue type and the DA DC is as good as it gets. You could have started taking assassin at level 6, but than you have to push at least WS back to a later level. The 3 feats you invest to improve stealth compensate for a low dexterity, but you still have the armor check penalty to overcome. Standard elven cloak and boots will fill the gap and even more.The stealth skills in full plate with cat's grace are 21 and 31/32 with the elven gear.</div>",

      "content": "<div>Thanks Mick,<br/>\n<br/>\n I thought of bringing my strength-based Assassin to the RP-Level PW's and i can't hide the fact that the builld amazes even myself on paper. He really looks strong and durable (Dwarf, heh) and although he can't possibly reach the stealth hights of his finesse brothers &amp; sisters those three feats does give him a strong base to improve upon via skill boosting items and/or spells. If all fails, he still hits like a truck and uses all tools of war via umd. I hope he will make a fine addition to the shinobi team although he is a tad brutal for that term...</div>"

Cheers.\u00a0</div></blockquote>\nWell, you'd lose 24 skill points at level 1 (Rogue at level 1 gives you [8+3] x 4 = 44, while Fighter gives you [2+3] x 4 = 20), which is at least one entire skill. That said, you would gain 6 of those points back at level 3, so it's a nett loss of 18, which is still a sizeable amount.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you went the other way and took Rogue at level 1 and 2 your skill points remain intact and you'd get an earlier Tumble AC bonus at level 2 - and earlier Evasion. However, it would mean delaying some feats by a level or two (you couldn't take Weapon Focus in Greataxe until level 3, for example), but it would all shake through by the time you take the first Assassin level.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour call!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",
