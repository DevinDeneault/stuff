According to NWNWiki,<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cThe grapple check used to determine whether or not a tentacle hits a target is as follows:<br/>\n1d20 + caster level (to a maximum of 20) + 4(tentacle's strength modifier) + 4(tentacle's size modifier) versus<br/>\n1d20 + base attack bonus + strength modifier + size modifier.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\n\"\u2026Due to a bug in the script, a medium-sized target gets a +8 bonus, as if he were of huge size.\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom what I understood, against the spell\u2019s most vulnerable target (e.g lvl 40 mage), the most I could expect is a dismal 50% effectiveness.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I decided to drop both EBT and ILMS. Lesser Spell Breach is retained for option to conserve Mord\u2019s.
