Hopefully a quick question for you...<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been noodling about with Barbarians again (stop it - you're better than that <span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83d\ude09</span>), primarily because I've been missing some \"Hulk bash, Hulk smash!\" lately, and may have to resort to kicking small yappy dogs over garden walls if I don't get another meleer up and running. Anyway, to the question...<br/>\n<br/>\nAssuming you're taking both Terrifying and Mighty Rage (both as Barb bonus feats, in all likelihood), which would you take first - assuming you qualify for both by the mid 20s?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

I just didn't want to blindly make assumptions.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight, back to my noodling (all the while bewailing being forbidden from making a Barbarian Dwarven Defender - curse those NwN gods!).<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",
