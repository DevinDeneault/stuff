      "content": "<div>Hello again, back to pick your brains!<br/>\n I am lookiong for a lvl 40 PvP build. I was looking for a high lvl assassin but also was wondering if I could get in a EpicSpell? My thought was to wear down my opponent then blast him with a Hellball to knock him down then DA him to the grave. Not sure if this is feasible or not.<br/>\n The Assassin gets HiPS at lvl 10 and I like the PM sneak immune. I really do not care on the Race of the toon though I do like Halflings that duel wield for an Assassin but not sure if there is room for all the feats for that and if not I would rather sneak around with a 2H weapon and they can not carry those...so whatever you guys think is best. I will play STR or DEX build. I was looking at this build by Ythaniel <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build217926.html.\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 17926.html.</a> but think I could tweak it a bit? I am up for any ideas and thoughts, Any diff combo or whatever.\u00a0Thank you for your time.</div>"

The death attack is a surprise attack that sends the target to his grave before he realizes what is happening.<br/>\n In order to get the best possible death attack, you want to take as many assassin levels as possible, and then some. A high intelligence helps to some extent with the DC too.<br/>\n If you want to take enough caster/PM levels to be able to cast epic spells, that will subtract a lot from the efficiency of the death attack, both damage and DC. A hellball is a one shot trick that is far less effective than a maximized death attack.<br/>\n For further reading: See my assassin guide under the \"game guides\" forum.</div></div>",

      "content": "<div>That's funny in a sense, i was readying a build with high Assassin that is rather... unusual but then you came in with an even more strange/innovative build request ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n But to be truthful i am not seeing this working, at least for PvP, i mean have you looked at the AB Ythaniel's build gets? Your opponents\u00a0 could have dropped their shields, removed their armour and lay down to bask on the glorious sun and you still would have not hit them with your unbelievably low 27 AB. That number was so low that i calculated it manually to be sure and it turned out that he \" <em>cheated </em>\" himself by not calculating the weapon focusses and epic prowess, which amounts to a final AB of 31, but still, this is not gonna work, ever. His second build is much-much better though, he improved a lot which i always like to see, and he made a Scyther with 35 AB, that was strength-based this time, but now he doesn't have epic spells. Your link by the way, doesn't work for me in your post so i did not know to which of the two builds you were referring to, therefore i gave my answer to both if you don't mind. Now, Dark Knight's build is more like what you want as it has both epic spells and enough Assassin inside to rise a good death attack DC but i wonder if that's the way you will be most effective because i don't see a single \" <em>hellball </em>\" buying you enough time to finish off your opponents in PvP unless you have a really big amount of sneak dice/ attacks.<br/>\n My suggestion would be to narrow your focus in one direction instead of two and try to be the best in it. You either want a <em>'\" heavy hitter \"</em> with 10 Assassin levels to gain Hips and some sneak attack OR you want the best Death attack you can muster with just enough PM levels to gain a good amount of protection. Forget one-shot tools like \" <em>hellball </em>\" as they are at best, a win-more card. I will be back later with actual suggestions of builds.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Alright, this is a weird one but i did my best,<br/>\n<br/>\n Based on what i remember about Sinfar's rules you get a big (+4 AC) bonus if you wield a two-handed weapon without a shield of course. And since Scythe is a dual-damage type weapon it is very hard to resist it's damage, not to mention those sick (x4) criticals that will make short work of anything unfortunate to be on the receiving end of it. Moreover i loved the fact that this is gonna be a <em>cheater </em>of some sort, you (<em>can't sneak me - but i can, you can't crit me - but i will!</em>) made me want to see what's the best we can do with a build like that. It's gonna be a strength-based Assassin and it's gonna hit really hard! There are of course two problems with that, the first is the <em>number of attacks</em> and the second is the <em>AB</em>, cause all the damage of the world won't do a thing if you can't hit them. Ythaniel's second build has a 35 AB but i knew we can do better than that although not by much, every bit helps for sure. So, my proposal is to make a <em>(Bard 5/ Pale master 10/ Assassin 25) </em>build with a <em>(Bard 4/ Pale master 6/ Assassin 10) </em>split pre-epic. Keep your 5th Bard level for last because you will be able to max discipline, spellcraft and taunt that way. The reason that i changed wizard with bard is to get a better BAB and of course for discipline and taunt. You won't have wizard spells at all but on the other hand, Bard will give you UMD which is vastly more powerful than the 5th CL spells of a neophyte wizard, provided that you have access to spell scrolls and even better wands.<br/>\n ****************************<br/>\n Race: Human,<br/>\n<br/>\n Build: <em>(Bard 5/ Pale master 10/ Assassin 25)</em><br/>\n<br/>\n Starting / Final Stats: (STR 17 (32)\u00a0 DEX 08\u00a0 CON 12\u00a0 INT 16\u00a0 WIS 08\u00a0 CHA 11)<br/>\n<br/>\n Feats Pre-Epic: Heavy Armour, Exotic Weapons, WF: Scythe, IC: Scythe, Blind Fighting, Disarm, Improved Disarm, Toughness<br/>\n<br/>\n Feats Epic: EWF: Scythe, Epic Prowess, Great STR [5], ISA [1], ESF: Move Silently, ESF: Hide<br/>\n<br/>\n Skills (324): Discipline: 43 (54), Spellcraft: 42 (45), Taunt: 43 (43), Move Silently: 43 (52), Hide: 43 (52), UMD: 35 (35), Tumble: 40 (39), Perform: 9 (9), Heal: 26 (25)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hit Points: 338<br/>\n<br/>\n Final AB: +51/ +51/ +46/ +41\u00a0 [+12 Strength/ +6 Scythe/ Bard song/ Haste]<br/>\n<br/>\n Death Attack DC: 44 [Maxed-out INT]<br/>\n<br/>\n Sneak Attack: 14d6<br/>\n ****************************<br/>\n Let me hear your thoughts man, i definitely like it but you are the final arbiter ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Dark Knight, your build was quite good as well and i long pondered about making this a (Bard 5/ PM 16/ Ass 19) with dual epic spells, but in the end i decided to go the Death attack route as you in your second post because i did not know all the spell changes in Sinfar. But definitely it has good potencial if they have strengthen their epic-spells or if you want to make an Indestructible Assassin (EMS plus EW).<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>Looking over the builds I think I will try your idea first Valerfor then dark Knights. Only cause they have tweaked the epic spells some and don't seem to last very long. I also like the UMD cause I have toons that are made just to make wands and scrolls for my other toons that can use them. They are limited to what you can make but still helps. The spells that help me a lot in PvP is the Clarity and  see invisy which I tend to lack in some of my Melee builds, so this really sounds like a good build for my play style! Valerfor...if you don't mind would you be so kind to draw me up this build? I have never seen anyone use the Disarm feat and could not find anything about it on the servers webpage. So I am thinking just get rid of those two for something else, maybe Stealthy and Iron will? or something like that. thanks to everyone who threw in their ideas!

      "content": "<div>Campgod, just to expand a bit on what others are noting: Hellball is a marginal epic spell for assassins, and perhaps even in general. For purposes of generating KD, any one shot attack that only KDs the target for 3 seconds isn't worth an epic feat. And, even for other purposes, unless your PW modifies the spell substantially, Hellball has pretty major drawbacks. For one, it's a non-party-friendly spell with a 20 meter range and 20 meter radius, so it's pretty easy to get caught in the spell yourself (especially if you have any hope of dashing in to get death attacks on the target when they are KDed) and it's especially hard on summons. Second, any substantial elemental resistance can really nerf the damage output. Even plain old Protection from Elements will cut the average damage to the target to 20 hp total, and that's if he fails his reflex save.<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, if generating KDs via spells is the goal, Bigby's is a better route. Of course, if BFH is nerfed (as it is on Sinfar), then you are stuck against anyone who can make a reflex save. Same reflex save issue for Great Thunderclap (reflex save and also short duration), though at least that spell ignores spell resistance, which can be useful. <br/>\n<br/>\n If you are looking to incorporate epic spells into your build, it looks like Sinfar has buffed up the two summons a bit. And, this is sort of a roundabout way of getting KD out of your epic spell, since the Dragon Knight dragon has IKD and can often KD opponents with high discipline (the dragon class is full AB, dragons typically have high STR, and they get a +8 size bonus on the discipline check). DK is also a nice summons against opponents who are sneakers, since they have permanent True Sight. The typical (and legitimate) complaint about Dragon Knight is the relatively short duration, but it should be long enough for PvP, especially since Sinfar DKs are immune to Word of Faith.<br/>\n<br/>\n Val, nice build. BTW, it doesn't affect the outcome (or reduce the value of using bard as the base class), but assassins get UMD as a skill, so he would have that even with wizard as his base class.</div>"

      "content": "<div>@ Campgod, i wouldn't be so hasty to throw out the Disarm feats yet, you see those are one of the little nasty secrets of this build, and they go nicely with the 2-Handed aspect of your Assassin. Basically whenever you make a disarm attempt with your Scythe against any opponents that wields tiny weapons (kukris, daggers) <strong><em>you will gain an intimidating (+8) AB</em></strong>, this goes on for small weapons (handaxes, short-swords) as well but to a lesser degree-the bonus is only <strong><em>(+4) AB</em></strong>, and when you fight someone who uses medium weapons (longswords, warhammers) you simply make the disarm attempt <em><strong>for free</strong></em>. Now i will make a guess that if they fail even a single <em>Disarm check</em> they will lose the match, (unless they hit really hard with their bear fists) and the same goes for <em>Death attack</em> of course, so use it and use it a lot! There are two exceptions to this rule, <em><strong>don't</strong></em> use it against other 2-Handers and don't use it against Open Fist Monks. You don't often see people use this feat, because many opponents in PvE have non-disarmable weapons for balance reasons and of course monsters usually don't have any weapons other than their natural ones, but in PvP this is very useful as all of your opponents who bear a weapon are eligible targets for this feat. If you still don't find that feat useful then replace it with anything that you deem useful in your server.<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Dark Knight, you may find useful the <em>SF: Conjuration</em> feats pre-epic (perhaps in place of the <em>disarm/ improve disarm </em>feats) for your build, as they give several bonuses to the epic summons in Sinfar, and thanks :)<br/>\n Ah, almost forgot that Sinfar Pale masters of 11 level and above, when they cast <em>\" Dragon Knight</em> \" they instead summon a <em>Dracolich! </em>Now, i don't know if this affects the stats of the dragon at all but it is damn cool!<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Zork, thanks for the heads-up man - i forgot that Assassins have <em>UMD </em>in their skill list as well.</div>"

      "content": "<div>@ Dark Knight, the PM AC bonuses are not negated completely but instead halfed from my understanding of the rules changes. For example 16 PM levels in Sinfar would get you (+5) Bone armor instead of (+10) which is the norm. Also EMA does not give you (+5) Dodge AC but (+4) instead and EW is (level * 20) damage absorbion instead of (level * 50) and those changes i presume is to prevent the PM domination in the PvP arena. Still though even with those changes PM's are incredibly hard to defeat especially with (16) levels of them and the two defensive epic spells considering that they will have (+9) AC above the norm and a (320) damage shield that you will have to burst before even you start hacking at their real life points. Don't forget that they are immune to both Criticals and Sneaks so all hits are just normal hits. Equally attractive though is the dual epic summons though both because they have strengthen them and because they will make your opponents susceptible to your sneak attacks. In both cases though i would say go for a Strength Assassin because if you have only (19) Assassin levels you can't solely rely on your Death attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#0000CD\"><strong>Sinfar Rule Changes</strong></span> =&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://forum.sinfar.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=682\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://forum.sinfar.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=682</a></div>"

      "content": "<div>The level spread would be exactly the same pre-epic campgod, it is in the epics that things change a little bit for each variation. You basically go for (Bard 4/ PM 6/ Ass 10) pre-epic and then take the rest of (Assassin/ Pale Master) levels depending on how many of each of them you want. And here is a little crazy thought i had the other day... Your server says that it has empowered a little all undead right? Then it also says that epic spell focus in conjuration gives some huge permanent bonuses to your summons and also quadruples their duration right? Then again it states that every odd level of pale master above 10th will also give a true caster level to you... Now look at what pale masters can summon with \"dragon knight\" and especially what they can summon if they are of 30th level with 30 charisma. See where i am going? Now how to take advantage of that huge charisma, of course not by going into melee so maybe something like (Bard 6/ BG 4/ PM 30) that finishes at 30 Charisma and literally has every single spell available. Get Divine Shield for a huge bonus to AC then summon your 40hit dice dracolich that is also empowered from the Conjuration focuses, sing your Bard song and then sit back and blast your foes with epic spells or ice storms while your summons rip them apart. What, did you just finally destroyed my Dracolich? Oh, alright here is my 40hit dice epic mummy, it says \"hello\", and i have also an empowered demi-lich for ya just in case! What, did you tried to hit me just now? You can't be serious with my epic warding shield of 600 hp's and my 80 AC, meanwhile take a greater ruin in your face, no- evasion does not aply to this ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n Of course i don't know if all these work in practise or if the palemaster above 10th lvl rises also Bard casting levels or if you actually summon a Dracolich and not something that simply has the appearance of it but the stats and abilities of a normal red dragon, but sometimes i just like to find compinations that seem to be interesting.</div>"
