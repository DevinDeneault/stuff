      "content": "<div>The raiders lined the boys up in the center of the little village, in front of where the cooking pots hung over burned out fire pits. \u00a0Surrounded by the charred remains of the huts and hovels - and the hacked up bodies of the parents and families of the boys - the raiders went through their selection process. \u00a0The village girls had already been distributed as spoils to the Captains, to serve in their households (and, later, when they were older, their beds) as slaves. \u00a0The boys were different, however. \u00a0Only the boys who were worthy would survive.<br/>\n<br/>\n \"Kang na mitha,\" ordered the patrol leader. \u00a0Each of the boys was given a small axe. \u00a0There were 12 boys in total, all hungry, thirsty and scared. \u00a0They were in pairs, each with a boy of similar age and size. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n \"Who wants food?\", thundered the patrol leader. \u00a0All of the boys raised their hands \u00a0 \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n \"If you want to eat, food is here. \u00a0All you have to do is kill the boy who is next to you and you will get food!\"<br/>\n<br/>\n The boys trembled and looked about. \u00a0They were young - most barely old enough to help with chores like finding kindling sticks or picking sai berries. \u00a0They were in disbelief hearing the words of the raider.<br/>\n<br/>\n \"Kill him!\" \u00a0The raider ordered the first boy in line, pointing to the child next to him. \u00a0Both boys teared up, one shaking and the other wetting himself. \u00a0The raider swung his sword and took the heads of both boys in one arc.<br/>\n<br/>\n The raider moved to the next pair of boys. \u00a0\"Kill him!\", he roared. \u00a0The two boys blubbered and dropped their axes. \u00a0The raider took their heads, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n He moved to the next pair of boys. \u00a0\"Kill him!\", he hissed. \u00a0Little Cobbin, stood there, shaking &amp; sobbing. \u00a0Next to him, Donol looked at the raider, took his axe and buried it in the side of Cobbin's face.<br/>\n<br/>\n \"Good! \u00a0We have one,\" said the patrol leader. \u00a0\"Dispose of the others.\" \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n The raiders slew the last six boys and took Donol with them to be raised as a\u00a0<em>Dayo</em>.\u00a0Donol was 5 years old.<br/>\n<br/>\n That was nearly three decades ago. \u00a0Donol was a\u00a0<em>Dayo\u00a0</em>now. \u00a0Not merely a\u00a0<em>Dayo</em>\u00a0but a Captain of Captains of the\u00a0<em>Dayo</em>. \u00a0He came up through the ranks, learning very quickly how to become an efficient and deadly killer. \u00a0His people were physically gifted, so as he grew into his size and strength, he gained the notice of the War Leader. \u00a0Alone and unaided, Donol slipped into the impenetrable fortress of the hated Kai Nang and assassinated their Prince Regent. \u00a0Donol slew thousands with his war axe and prevailed in single combat a dozen times over the champions of other armies. \u00a0After all of that and other dazzling displays of prowess on the battlefield and utter ruthlessness in the accomplishment of his duties, he stood now as the\u00a0<em>Roko ni Katan</em>\u00a0- the Champion of the\u00a0<em>Dayo</em>. \u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Donol no longer remembers anything about the village . . . except for the sight of his hand axe going into Cobbin's head.<br/>\n<br/>\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n Pros: Good BAB, Rage and Bull's can add +5. \u00a0Improved Invisibility as a feat for 50% concealment, can deliver 10d6 extra damage via SA/DA. \u00a0Has IKD and full Taunt. \u00a0Dev.Crit DC of 40 is acceptable. \u00a0<br/>\n Cons: Lowish HP for a meleer. \u00a0Low Will and Reflex saves. \u00a0Needs to get to mages before they get their spells off.<br/>\n<br/>\n Barbarian 15 Blackguard 16 Assassin 9 (tested in PGCC)<br/>\n<br/>\n STR 16 (30)<br/>\n DEX 10<br/>\n CON 14<br/>\n WIS 8<br/>\n INT 14<br/>\n CHA 14<br/>\n<br/>\n Human, Neutral Evil, PvE<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Barb (1) - PA, Cleave<br/>\n 02: Barb (2)<br/>\n 03: Barb (3) - WF:Battleaxe<br/>\n 04: Barb (4) - STR+1<br/>\n 05: Barb (5)<br/>\n 06: Barb (6) - KD<br/>\n 07: Barb (7)<br/>\n 08: BG (1) - STR+1<br/>\n 09: BG (2) - IC:Battleaxe<br/>\n 10: BG (3)<br/>\n 11: BG (4)\u00a0<br/>\n 12: BG (5) - STR+1, IKD<br/>\n 13: BG (6)<br/>\n 14: BG (7)<br/>\n 15: BG (8) \u2013 GC<br/>\n 16: BG (9) \u2013 STR+1<br/>\n 17: BG (10)<br/>\n 18: Barb (8) \u2013 BF<br/>\n 19: Barb (9)<br/>\n 20: Barb (10) \u2013 STR+1<br/>\n 21: Barb (11) \u2013 GRSTR I<br/>\n 22: Assn (1)<br/>\n 23: Assn (2)<br/>\n 24: Barb (12) \u2013 STR+1, OC<br/>\n 25: Barb (13)<br/>\n 26: Barb (14)<br/>\n 27: Assn (3) \u2013 GRSTR II<br/>\n 28: Assn (4) \u2013 STR+1<br/>\n 29: Assn (5)<br/>\n 30: Barb (15) \u2013 Terrifying Rage<br/>\n 31: BG (11)<br/>\n 32: Assn (6) \u2013 STR+1<br/>\n 33: Assn (7) \u2013 Dev Crit<br/>\n 34: Assn (8)<br/>\n 35: BG (12)<br/>\n 36: BG (13) \u2013 STR+1, EWF, GRSTR III<br/>\n 37: Assn (9)<br/>\n 38: BG (14)<br/>\n 39: BG (15) \u2013 GRSTR IV<br/>\n 40: BG (16) \u2013 EP<br/>\n<br/>\n HP \u2013 474 (max) 395 (rolled)<br/>\n Saves (F/R/W): 28/18/17 (all +3 vs Spells) (+4 vs. Poison) (+3 Will while raging)<br/>\n<br/>\n BAB 30<br/>\n AB (max. naked): 44 (melee) 30 (ranged) (+4 rage) (+1 Bull's feat to melee)<br/>\n Damage (mundane battleaxe) 1-8 +10 (1-8+15 with rage and Bull's feat) (+10d6 from SA/DA) (19-20 X3 on a crit)<br/>\n Potential damage on a critical sneak = 213 (228 rage/buffed)\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane plate &amp;

Your primary save is fine \"as is\".\u00a0 TBH, there are usually enhancements available that make Will saves unnecessary (i.e. Immunity to fear, mind-control) but seldom any that help avoid all that damage from fireballs and most all other evocation threats.\u00a0 I'd be more concerned with the low reflex myself because it is more common.<br/>\n<br/>\n I realize your intent was to race to DevCrit as quickly as possible. Good instincts. However, this is neither an RDD nor WM build hence the AB is somewhat low-end for DevCrit.\u00a0 In a case like that, the most important factor is boosting AB quickly.\u00a0 \"You can't crit if you can't hit!\"<br/>\n<br/>\n Make sure to post applicable alignment restrictions... this one is any non-lawful evil toon.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now for a friendly nudge...<br/>\n<br/>\n Please, please... post only finalized, fully-tested builds in the Finished Builds subforums.\u00a0 If you are looking for input, please post untested builds along with the Build Requests. The intent has always been to allow players to bring up a build that is ready-to-go to save them the trouble of sanitizing it themselves before playing.\u00a0 There will often be input from the guild to help it work better, but those comments are typically refinements rather than correcting major gaffes.</div>"
