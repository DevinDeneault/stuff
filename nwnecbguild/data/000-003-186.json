      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hey fellas<br/>\n<br/>\n So, I'm back again and I'd appreciate hearing an expert opinion. Arelith has long had a class called the warlock, which was possibly the single worst class in the entire history of NWN for PvP. Not joking, it really was that awful, it made my harper scout look OP.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now they've totally overhauled it, and I'm actually quite tempted to give it a go. I've got a DEX based build in mind but I'd appreciate any suggestions for making the most of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n the class comes in two different flavours; giving different spells and immunitiess are.....<br/>\n<br/>\n Bard Base- Loses Bard Song and acess to Curse song. All other skills and feats available remain the same except...<br/>\n<br/>\n - Must be Non-Good<br/>\n - Gains d8 rather than d6 HP per level<br/>\n - Gains Uncanny Dodge at level 10, 5/- damage resistance at level 20, and 10/- at level 30 to all physical types (piercing/slashing/bludgeoning)<br/>\n - 5/10/15 DR at the above levels to two elements (Acid and Fire for Fiends, Cold and Electricity for Fey)<br/>\n - Innate -20% Arcane Spell failure (Other Spell Failure reducing Medium armour and Large Shields are available too)<br/>\n - Warlocks have unlimited spells per day, with no cooldown and whenever the Warlock casts a spell that targets a hostile opponent, unless it's a Charm/Dominate spell - they do 1d4/level damage (applying only to the direct target of the spell, casting Confusion will deal damage to the target and force them and everyone around them to make a save or be affected, but only the main target takes damage) of an element depending on the pact. Fey Warlocks can pick and switch between Magic, Cold and Electrical damage while Fiends have Magic, Fire and Acid.<br/>\n -All spells otherwise work as normal when cast on the floor or party members. When cast directly on hostiles the target has to fail a touch attack roll, otherwise they avoid both the damage and the spell itself!<br/>\n<br/>\n The Spells they get are.....<pre>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Fey\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Fiend\n\u00a0 1\u00a0 \u00a0Daze (0), Light (0)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Flare (0), Light (0)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 2\u00a0 \u00a0Sleep (1), Exp Ret (1)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Summon Creature (1), Lesser Dispel (1)\n\u00a0 3\u00a0 \u00a0Mage Armor (1)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Balagarn's Iron Horn (1)\n\u00a0 4\u00a0 \u00a0Tasha's Laughter (2)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bull's Strength (2)\n\u00a0 5\u00a0 \u00a0Cure Minor (0)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Resistance (0), Grease (1)\n\u00a0 6\u00a0 \u00a0Charm Person (1)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Protection from Alignment (1)\n\u00a0 7\u00a0 \u00a0Displacement (3)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bestow Curse (3)\n\u00a0 8\u00a0 \u00a0Hold Person (2)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Summon Creature (2)\n\u00a0 9\u00a0 \u00a0Ghostly Visage (2)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Darkness (2)\n\u00a0 10\u00a0 Hold Monster (4)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dismissal (4)\n\u00a0 11\u00a0 Invisibility (2)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ultravision (2)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Cloud of Bewilder (2)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Gust of Wind (3)\n\u00a0 12\u00a0 Slow (3)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Summon Creature (3)\n\u00a0 13\u00a0 Mind Fog (5), Charm Monster(3) See Invis (2)\n\u00a0 14\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Dispel Magic (3), Eagle's Splendour (2)\n\u00a0 15\u00a0 Haste (3)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Fear (3)\n\u00a0 16\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Energy Buffer (6)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 17\u00a0 Dominate Person (4)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Summon Creature (4)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 18\u00a0 Improved Invis (4)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cat's Grace (2)\n\u00a0 19\u00a0 Confusion (3)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 War Cry (4)\u00a0\n\u00a0 20\u00a0 Mass Haste (6)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Summon Creature (5)\n\u00a0 21\n\u00a0 22\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Greater Dispelling (5)\n\u00a0 23\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 24\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 25\u00a0 Dirge (6)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Summon Creature (6)\n\u00a0 26\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 27\n\u00a0 28\u00a0 Ethereal Visage (5)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ice Storm (6)\n\u00a0 29\n\u00a0 30</pre>Summon Monster Spells cast by the fiend are improved, and each one summons a fiend of seemingly decent power (Summon I summons a Level 6 Worg). Warlocks with Greater Spell Focus Conjuration and Summon Creature VI supposedly gain an especially powerful summon (which I've heard is comparable to the Balor Summoned by Gate).<br/>\n<br/>\n So...What do you think fellas? I was considering some Dex based Fey/Monk/Blackguard but I'm not sure, I mean the seeming uselessness of some fo the fiend spells puts me off but I can see pretty clearly that a level 30 Ice Storm with 30d4 extra damage followed by another quickened/hasted spell would hurt a lot. Mechanics on Arelith are by and large mostly close to vanilla, the main restrictions being on building are that you must take 3 levels consecutivley of a class while levelling up (So Bard/Bard/Bard/Monk is alright but Bogue/Rogue/Monk isn't), PDK is banned, RDD and Shifter are off limits to people who don't spend 20 hours a day on the server grinding PC's up to thrity to sacrifice for a 5% win chance lottery roll (PM is attainable, but not as easily as the other prestige classes) and you cannot keep levels in an alignment restricted class if you are no longer of that alignment (so no Neutral Blackguards and the like).<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers fellas<br/>\n<br/>\n Thell<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

And it is even more powerful in your low magic world that has only 30 lvls.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Just my opinion of course, with the limited knowledge that i have for Arelith,<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I play an abyssal lock myself, and from what I've seen, they're the most offensive-capable. Sending in the summon can soak up a lot of damage, for the crowds, grease spell works wonders, 2-3 and they can't keep their feet. I run only 13 STR, and 18 DEX, but a Bull's Strength before combat or two brings you up to 18. Flare can help mitigate damage to you or your summon, and bestow curse is powerful when used in the right spots. Mind you, these are low level spells, but a quick bestow curse can drop your target's hp, AC, and AB down by at least one point, but that 1 point can be all you need. 1d4/lvl doesn't sound like much, but keep in mind, you'll hit the fighter classes rather reliably with it, and weakening them before they get to you can be crucial to besting them. Most caster classes also lack the saves to beat your effects, my Drow Abyss-lock beat a cleric 3x her level and came out unscathed<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
