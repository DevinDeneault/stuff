That means MULTIPLE alignment shifts and the need for a 3rd class that can be useful with just a few levels and has Hide and Move Silently as class skills (otherwise you'll need at least 7 levels of the other\u00a0class, as both Assassin and CoT are prestige classes). That presents a lot of challenges, not to mention the fact that there really aren't that many synergies between the classes. For example, what would CoT add to a guy that relies on approaching unseen and paralyzing opponents? Wouldn't Fighter be better for WS / EWS? Or what would Assassin add to a melee guy who has high saves and a lot of feats? Wouldn't Rogue be better for more skill points and Evasion and not requiring an alignment shift?<br/>\n<br/>\n On the other hand, it's a new concept, and\u00a0you've been here for a while, so why don't you try to build this thing yourself and once you've got a build sketch you post it here for revision and tweaking?<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div></div>"

Just as a reminder, you need to have 8 Hide and Move Silently for Assassin, for SD you also need Tumble, Dodge and Mobility (which requires 13 DEX), so you are basically reducing the requirements of HiPS and adding all the Assassin mojo to it. I think it kinda fits the concept, but from a gaming perspective, it really isn't balanced.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for builds, you should start by reading my Complete Guide to the Basics of Building in the Game Guides section. I would really be surprised if you were a good builder without ever having made any builds. It takes experience and trial and testing and knowledge, but it's all at your disposal here. It seems like this is a great place to get you started :D<br/>\n<br/>\n Have fun!</div></div>"

      "content": "<div>A Hin is not advised here, and the reason for this is that you don't have the means for Epic Dodge, so Dexterity-based isn't that appealing in this case. Human would fare better and you could always use his bonus feat for those BG requirements and Divine Feats. Better start with Human and (Str 16, Dex 8, Con 12, Int 14, Wis 8, Cha 16) use a sword &amp; large (not tower) shield set-up, and get those feats: Weapon Focus, Improved Critical, Knockdown, Improved Knockdown, Blind Fight, Power Attack, Cleave, Divine Shield pre-epics. Then in epic levels you should get Epic Weapon Focus, Epic Prowess (bonus), Armour Skin, Great Strength IV, ESF: Hide (bonus), ESF: Move Silently (bonus), Epic Reflexes (bonus), Improved Sneak Attack (bonus) and Divine Might OR something similar. The split will be (Ranger 9/ BG 3/ Ass 8) pre-epic and final split should be (Ranger 10/ BG 4/ Assassin 26) OR similar. Now, do understand that i did that of the top off my head in literally two minutes, so there might be better ways to do this or i might made some mistakes, but in general this is a good way to start building your character. The AC &amp; Saves should be really good for a Strength-based Assassin if you max-out your Charisma (+9 to everything) and damage is guaranteed because you are Strength-based with access to umd and 30 natural strength, not to mention the 13 (14) d6's of Sneak attack &amp; IKD. Death attack's DC is a healthy 38/ 44 (with maxed INT), so you are no slouch there either.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, if you wanted a Dexterity-based Assassin (traditional hin-ninja) you should ask Mick kindly, he is the president of shinobi around here and has made more than a couple of them already. Some say he cuts his steaks with a kusarigama that he always carries with him, so he should know better than me...<br/>\n<br/>\n Hope i helped some,</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hey campgod!<br/>\n<br/>\n Val's suggested spread is really optimized, with only one exception. I wouldn't take BG 4 in epics. The reason it's optimized is that you have 4 BG levels to take Divine Might and Divine Shield, (the minimum you need), Ranger 10 gives you a Bonus Feat, which, if taken in Epics (after 20) can be Epic Prowess. And Assassin 26 also gives you a bonus feat.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n One more thing you should do is go to the Search Engine and get an idea from the Ranger / BG / Assassin builds that are already out there. They may serve you as inspiration. You could look at the differences and similarities between them and decide what suits you best in each. I always do this. When I have an idea for a build, I look at what has been done. Sometimes what I thought about is original, but sometimes I find builds that are EXACTLY what I thought about making. Then I save those builds into my \"favorite builds from other builders\" folder. In that folder I have several masterpieces, such as Grizz's Dracolich of Autumn Twilight, Mith's Blood &amp; Faith, Mith's Hierophant of Valsharoon, Kail's Order of Jormungandr, StryderBlade's Dwarven Wall of Wonders, Val's Battle Sorceress, Mick's Spellsword of Bahamut, just to name a few.<br/>\n<br/>\n Those builds were almost exactly done the way I'd do them, and the changes I'd have made to them to suit my style (if any at all) would've been so small that they're just mere tweaks. Seeing what's been done may give you a better idea of what you should pursue.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<br/>\n<br/>\n EDIT: I forgot to mention the most common occurence when it comes to searching the Search Engine. I find many or at least a few builds with the class combo but that are quite sub-optimal according to my standards, which is exactly what happened with my STR-based Assassin. I did find many builds, most were DEX-based, which was out of my scope, but those were quite good, then the two STR-based builds were quite underwhelming and I was able to build something much more powerful\u00a0than what was there.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Not that bad for a 1st build, man! Much better than mine were when I first started, for sure!<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, I do see a few problems and a few good things about it, so let me give you a general overview on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n 1- the split is the best possible, but NOT if you are going for Taunt. The idea is to take BG 4 pre-epic and take Divine Shield in place of Iron Will, for example. Why would a HIPSer stand in front of an enemy long enough to Taunt them? It just doesn't make sense! Suggestion: drop Taunt and move BG 4 to level 15, taking Divine Might and Divine Shield pre-epic.<br/>\n<br/>\n 2- Improved Sneak Attack doesn't work unless you have Sneak Attack (from BG or Rogue), and BGs only get Sneak Attack at level 4, so if you weren't convinced on Taunt dropping, this is surely a very good reason.<br/>\n<br/>\n 3- Warhammers are not the best weapon for this guy, much less a 2-handed Maul, because with 26 Assassin levels, you want as many attacks in the first flurry as you can for more chances to paralyze your opponent (why else would you play an Assassin?). I'd stick with Handaxes or Maces, which can be dual-wielded with ease. That's also part of the reason you went with Ranger and not Fighter, so that you could dual-wield without the DEX investment. Handaxes also have a better threat range.<br/>\n<br/>\n 4- HIPS comes very late, so I suggest dropping Lightning Reflexes for Expertise to increase your survivability pre-epic. I'd also take it at level 1 and delay Blind Fight. <br/>\n<br/>\n 5- The not-taking of Divine Shield in epics frees up a feat, which you can use to rework your starting stats for more HP for free. Drop starting CHA to 15 and take those points and put them in CON, then swap your attribute increases around to include one CHA increase at whatever level you start using Divine Might and Divine Shield. Take Great Strength with that last feat to round up your stats.<br/>\n<br/>\n Other than these few things, the rest looks quite good. How did it feel to lose your building virginity? LOL<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Thanks max! It hurt and felt good...LOL.\u00a0 Since my toon is lvl 40 now i can redo all but my stats and lvl 1. So I see your point for survivability but now i am 40 I could get away with it?\u00a0I wasnt thinking about the size of the weapons...smaller they are the faster\u00a0attacks I can get off? As far as the\u00a0Improved SA i thought it works with the Assassins DA? He has 13d6, why would it let me take it then? I just looked at it in game says rogue, BG or Assassin with 8d6 DA. Now does the Imp. SA add +2 to the 13d or is that with it?\u00a0I think i will try your other suggestions though and see. Thank you for your wisdom.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Apparently you didn't take your time reading the wiki. It describes the bug with ISA. Read it:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Improved_sneak_attack\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">read the notes</a><br/>\n<br/>\n The thing about the weapons is not the size. It's that you can equip one weapon on the right hand as you would and one on the left hand. That is called dual-wielding, which for assassins is VERY good because you get extra attacks on the first flurry ( you have 2 normal and 3 hasted), which means higher chance of paralyzing an opponent with your Death Attack. Normally, you WOULD NEED the following feats to be able to dual-wield without a HUMUNGOUS penalty? Two-Weapon Fighting, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting and Ambidexterity (and you`d need to use a small weapon on the off-hand to prevent a higher penalty even with those feats.<br/>\n<br/>\n HOWEVER, Rangers receive all of that for free. They get Two-Weapon Fighting AND Ambidexterity combined in one feat called Dual-Wield at level 1, and they get Improved Two-Weapon Fighting at level 9, which is EXACTLY WHY we\u00a0told you to go with Ranger, or at least one of the reasons Rangers and Assassins are so synergetic. The\u00a0\"catch\" is that the Ranger dual-wield\u00a0only works with Light armor, so that means LOW AC for you, except that you have HIPS, so you can live with it.</div>"
