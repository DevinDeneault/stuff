      "content": "<div>Hello once more good people of the build pimpin' garage, I've a special order today.<br/>\n<br/>\n I've been thinking about a pvp build and my main interests are either some ranger/assassin build that utilizes bane or a BARBARIAN build,\u00a0<br/>\n now the main reason for that is in my server these classes are a bit changed, Assassin gets Hide in plain sight at level 8, and the barbarian rage, instead of giving you<br/>\n ability bonuses it just gives you +ab and +temporary hp (this stacks with everything else of course). in my server you can easily max strength so coupled with greater rage its +9 totally\u00a0<br/>\n for example. (i'm unsure if mighty rage and greater rage stacks there though). So i've been wondering if there's a good pvp builds that either utilize assassin(8+)/ranger(bane) OR barbarian (having in mind that greater rage gives you +3ab or mighty +4)<br/>\n<br/>\n Level cap: 40<br/>\n medium magic world: (true seeing lasts 18 seconds), can get all +5 ac items, haste, +6 enchantment on weapon, dev critical only doubles the damage of the crit if failed fortitude save<br/>\n<br/>\n p.s\u00a0<br/>\n ----<br/>\n the barbarian change also means that going dex with barbarian isn't that bad because your rage isn't added to strength but to +ab +hp<br/>\n Improved Sneak Attack: works for Assassin without Rogue/BG sneak.</div>"
