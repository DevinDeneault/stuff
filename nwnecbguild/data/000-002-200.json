You see elves a good bit more than gnomes, but usually they're not the best choice. In a\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/sorcerer-in-the-stone-t2354651.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">build request</a> that gave 'Elf' as a racial preference, after working out a build within the restriction Hipmeister commented \"your preference for elf is extremely costly: -33 skills, -30 HP, -1 Fort, -1 feat.\u00a0 At least your toon will have pointy ears, if that's any compensation.\" <br/>\n<br/>\nI really like the elf's (elves's?) racial ability to search all the time, as well as their skill affinities for recon, but I always feel like I'm struggling to make them fit any time I use them. Between their unhelpful favored class and their hit to constitution, whatever they do excel at due to the dex modifier is usually better covered by the halfling (who gets a +1 AB and +1 AC for their trouble). <br/>\n<br/>\nBut are there any situations where the Elf is the <em>best</em> option? Not just a passable one, but the <em>very best</em>? The obvious one that springs to mind is the Arcane Archer, but a lot of the best AAs will even go <em>half-elf</em> before they'll go elf!! Scrolling through the ECB archives with 'Elf' as the only filter, I still haven't found one that isn't an AA... (Perhaps thats due to its privileged position in the alphabetized list, though :P) (One build I'm reading, next to their max HP, reads \"&lt;-- :(\")<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It can serve clerics, bards\u00a0and druids well, and generally make it easier to qualify for CoT or WM in builds based on non-warrior classes.<br/>\nHumans get an extra feat that one can spend on WP Martial, but the other races don't.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Yeah, I used to take elf a lot when playing druids because they cant take weapon proficiencies. Druids do get the scimitar, though, but not a longbow.<br/>\n<br/>\n'Archer' seems to be one area where elves are ideally suited over the halfling because, while they're both +dex, they can use longbows while the halfling cant. Another possibility I'd been thinking of is that they might be best suited on a build that isn't actually dex-based, but wants to grab a cheap 18 dex; somethng that uses robes or light armour... A strength-based dual wielding ranger or something like that, or a sorcerer/RDD who wants to cast spells in combat. An empowered cats grace on top of a 17 dex, as well as +4 ac from the RDD, and +8 from some tumble dump prestige class, gives a naked AC of 29 (vs heavy armour's 31) and saves three feats spent on autostill...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Hopefully I don't come off as some power maniac who's only interested in the very best! Mainly I am just trying to learn the game mechanics &amp; the art of making good builds before I can be more on-the-fly/creative. Kind of like learning to write poems in iambic pentameter before moving on to a more expressive blank verse... That, and getting my butt kicked taking my favourite elf RP character to World of Greyhawk the past couple days has me thinking about turning up the power - although that might not be my elf's (elve's?) fault, admittedly <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /> Anyway, I'm mostly asking in a purely academic way, \"what can an elf do like no one else?\"<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the tip about the Kama Shinobi Stagmeister, I'll check it out!

They could have been much more useful with \"Ranger\" instead. Anyway, if i had to find something useful that they have over Halflings, i would say they are the only medium-sized race that gets a dexterity bonus. Why that matters? Well, IKD with an Elf warrior is more useful that a Hin's one. Also Halflings take a Strength penalty and this can be a factor sometimes. If we are talking about builds, i used an Elf as well for my Epic Dodging-Strength-Based character \"Dodji Domotai\" &amp; Max used an Elf too in his \"Drow Fencer\".<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"color:#A64D79\">Dodji Domotai</span></strong> --&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/dodji-domotai-fighter-16-wm-7-rogue-17-t2353227.html#p632\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dodji-domotai-fighter-16-wm-7-rogue-17- ... .html#p632</a><br/>\n<strong><span style=\"color:#3D85C6\">Drow Fencer</span></strong> --&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/drow-fencer-fighter-14-rogue-19-weapon-master-7-t2329192.html#p457\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">drow-fencer-fighter-14-rogue-19-weapon- ... .html#p457</a><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

A halfling will need a tiny weapon offhand to reduce the AB penalty for dual wielding to -2.<br/>\nThe +1AB bonus from small size is not enough to compensate for the extra AB\u00a0penalty from dual wielding Kamas.<br/>\nThe extra strength that elf provides over halfling,\u00a0is only a minor factor in a build that wears robes and deals 42d6 damage in the opening attack, when attacking from stealth.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
