      "content": "<div>Hi everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently I been playing this server for a couple weeks. I read about it and the more I read the more I worry about building characters. I don't want to waste my time building something that cannot be played dealing with the epic boss. I heard high AC built doesn't fair good in BSK, because boss has insane AB and AC and resistances? So what to built? PM has high AC option but Pale Master's suffer from damage vulnerabilities to Bludgeoning (50%), Divine (100%), and Positive (100%). So it's out of the consideration. Anyone has experience in that server and deal with bosses?? One thing I am lack of is party time. Sigh.... I am always doing solo. Recently I am making a crafter 21 Wiz 19 Bard. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease make me a built that I can solo in BSK, I know it's not possible to solo in BSK but maybe something close to it. Thanks guys!</div>"

Dev critical has changed to 35% more damage instead of instant death. Btw have you played that server? I am new to that server so lots of details I might be missing out. High saves are good. They have lots of crazy items in BSK. Lots of elemental damage weaponary. +20 ab weapon enhancement can be crafted. But has to be made by a crafter. Not sure how many forge stones to do that. Anyway, i guess to solo, properly a Druid dragon or cleric or a wizard that has buffed epic mummy dust and it lvl up base on caster lvl if I am not wrong. <br/>\nHmmmm ... ???</div>"

      "content": "<div>First, check out the Blackstone keep forums. There's an entire section dedicated to various builds.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I've been playing there for a year soon. I've tried out dozens of builds and the way it works is like this: Whenever you find a build that might work, the owner of the PW makes a nerf of some vital item you need to manage to solo. I've been desperately trying to come up with a build that can solo the final two quests, Blood Cult and The Seventh Shrine, but nothing really works. You can search this forum for \"Blackstone\" and you'll probably find my threads trying to find a build.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be successful on Blackstone Keep you need to party up. One tank (typically a Dwarven Defender/Fighter kind of character with massive Damage Reduction) and one hitter (typically a Fighter/Weaponmaster kind of character with very high AB) accompanied by one Cleric with lots of heal spells might work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing is that if you don't reach AC70 fully geared, don't bother, go with DR and immunities instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, here's my recommendation, based on my own (so far failed) attempts to solo those. Try to build the following toons (you need UMD to be able to use wands and other items, hence rogue/bard levels). Note that the builds listed below are examples. If you have a favourite build for a tank, try that. Now the exact build you can search either the Blackstone Keep forums or the full 40 builds on this forum.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrafter Toon - Bard/Fighter/RDD with Craft weapon/armor 80+ (with items)<br/>\nTank - Dwarven Defender/Fighter/Rogue with at least 24DR<br/>\nHitter - Fighter/Weaponmaster/Rogue with AB50+ (DEX-based WM is good according to what I've heard, I haven't tried it myself, I hate rapiers)<br/>\nCleric with craft wand/scribe scroll - Cleric/Paladin/Rogue or Cleric/Bard/RDD<br/>\nWizard/Sorcerer with craft wand/scribe scroll - Wiz/Rogue or some Sorc build<br/>\n<br/>\nThat way you will find lots of Forge Stones and you can craft wands and scrolls with your cleric or wizard to provide the other toons with stuff.<br/>\nThen you need to be lucky and find the proper items.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to rumour and also I've seen some of them, there are builds that can actually solo eqipped with the right gear, but I don't know the specs or equipment for that. Blood Cult for instance is supposed to be solo-able with a cleric using implosion and TimeStop scrolls. I haven't figured it out though. If you do, please tell me!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, there's a discord channel for Blackstone Keep you might use too.</div>"

The owner of Blackstone is adamant that the only way to learn is to ask someone in game. So, if you find me in game, I will answer all your questions, for a price of course.<br/>\nStill, this much I can tell you. First you need to find the Forge. You will get some instructions on how it all works. You get some Forge Stones as reward from second half of quests, lvl 18ish and upwards. You can also find some Forge Stones in loot. There are many Forge Stones with various effects, some awesome, some useless. You need to ask in game to learn which stone makes what. But, you can theoretically make a weapon like this:<br/>\n+20AB<br/>\n+2d12 Fire damage<br/>\n+d6 Acid damage<br/>\n+d6 Electric damage<br/>\n+d6 Sonic damage<br/>\nkeen<br/>\n+2d12 massive criticals<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also (theoretically) make an armor with stuff like:<br/>\n-40% weight<br/>\n+4 Strength<br/>\n+6AC<br/>\nfreedom<br/>\nknockdown immunity<br/>\n+2 universal saves<br/>\n+1 regeneration<br/>\n15% immunity bludgeon<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a random element to Forging, but if you have 80+ craft weapon/armor, you will get best chances of high values.</div>"

In one case (the one which only opens twice a day), there are even switches far away from each other that needs to be switched simultaneously to open a door. So, in that case it's technically impossible to solo that area. You can't use the teleporting thingy to jump in or out of there either, so you HAVE to be a party.</div>"

Since your hit is based on STR bonus, obviously a dex-based WM will not make the same damage per hit as a str-based WM. Still, the dex-based WM will hit more often which should be good. On BSK (Blackstone Keep) it doesn't work that way since most monsters have massive Damage Resistance and immunities, not to mention some 10.000 hitpoints on end-game bosses. So, if you for instance make a monk which can get huge AC and decent AB but won't make much damage, you will pretty much spend all your time watching a fight between your toon and the boss where nobody can damage the other. That's why on BSK, most people build their WM:s on an str-based fighter.\n</div></blockquote>\n\nHmmm...cornflowers, do you mean Dex-based WM is better than Str-based for BSK environment? Hit more often but lesser damage since it is dex based. Does it mean that it's going to take a longer time to finish up the boss??\n</div></blockquote>\nNo, I wasn't clear. If you go dex-based, you will spend hours and hours watching a fight where nobody will hit each other. Go STR-based on BSK.</div>"

Divine wrath is once per day, so not much there either. I'm probably missing something relevant, though....</div>"

CoT give you the same as Fighter would, but better saves for no cost. In most settings though, sprinkle in a few Rogue or Bard instead. You lose 1 Ab, and saves, but thats it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSent fra min SM-G950F via Tapatalk<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>"
