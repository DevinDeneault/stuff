      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">I've had a scout around on Hip's Fantabulous Contrapulator and can't find one of these. RDD has been used to pump pretty much every build (that includes Bard and/or Sorcerer, obviously)...except one. Weaponmaster. So I thought I'd give it a look and see what happened.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can't promise I've made the most of it, but that's what this part of the Guild is about, no? I'm afraid I can't give a complete draft for your consideration, but please have a look and let me know what you think.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the huge problems is the lack of bonus feats (just the 3 WM ones in epic levels). And I'd have loved to get Dev Crit (who wouldn't with a 40 Strength build?), but things are too stretched. Maybe I'm looking for too much - after all, I reckon I do manage an AB of 50, and with +15 damage hits should hurt. I talk about where I think I'm having problems throughout (though there are probably others I haven't considered).<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I've gone for spear as my WoC. I'd have preferred Morning Star in many ways, but how often do you find decent ones?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, opinions please, on what is very much a draft!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>The Singing Spear</strong><br/>\nBard 8/ RDD 10/ WM 22<br/>\nHuman - non lawful<br/>\nPvM (untested as yet)<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR 16 (40)<br/>\nDEX 14<br/>\nCON 12 (14)<br/>\nWIS 8<br/>\nINT 14 (16)<br/>\nCHA 12 (14)<br/>\n<br/>\nHPs - 432<br/>\nAC - 26 (naked). Haven't worked the rest out yet as I'm not sure whether to grab Heavy Armour<br/>\nSaves - Fort 21/ Will 21/ Ref 24 (+9 vs Spells)<br/>\nSkill Points - 256. Disc 43 (58), Intimidate 4 (6), Listen (or Spot) 43 (46), Lore 8 (18) but bumpable with the spares, Perform 15 (17) but I'm not sure whether I only need a modified 15, Spellcraft 42 (45) but can be brought down by 5 points if taking final Bard level at 37 rather than 39, Tumble 40 (42), UMD 31 (33), 26 spare (or 28 if Perform is a modified skill) - for maybe more Lore, or Search, or Conc<br/>\nBAB - 26<br/>\nAB (max) 50/45/40/35 (damage 1d8+15 with spear or morning star.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">What you can consider is to take RDD 8 at lv19 and WM7 only at lv23\u00a0 - BAB wise it makes no difference, however you get the +2 int from RDD9 a level earlier = 1 skill point more. As side results you get the KI-Critical later while the other RDD earlier - but that is all temporary (after lv24 the only difference is that 1 skill point)<br/>\n<br/>\nPerform at 13 is enough as you get +2 from CHA<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat i would reconsider are the feat choices:<br/>\n1. Curse Song while not too powerfull at bard 8 perform 15 still gives enemies -2 to attack/damage. If you have a party that can profit from it well worth considering.<br/>\n2. i am not much a friend of all those \"Extra Strenght\" - basically you trade away 2 feats to get a +1 to attack/damage rolls and +1 to discipline (the extra carry weight shouldn't matter by that time). Getting Armour Skin and Epic Prowess instead gives you the same +1 to attacks but 2 AC more. Likewise Heavy Armour and Epic Wapeon focus are imho better than 2 \"Extra Strenghts\" - again you get 2 AC (due to using full plate instead of chain mail) more while you have +2 attack rolls rather than +1 attack/damage rolls and +1 discipline.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the skills are concerned: <br/>\nno point to ever put more points into Lore - you got 8 (needed for RDD) + 8 (bardic bonus) + 3 (INT) + 18 (Identify spell - it is a lv1 spell so you don't have to skip anything usefull for it) = 37 allready - enough for items under 1,2M gold worth or \"normal\" wapeons of +9 and lower. On top of that you could buff yourself more (+1 from Bard song, +2 from Foxes Cunning if you for some reason take it, potions of lore,....) and probably got some equipmenrt too (like boring generic rings of insight,...). Big point however is that basically anything you cannot identify is worth carrying back to town.<br/>\n<br/>\nConcentration is completely useless as melee-bard in my eyes: You are not casting anything during combat as due to arcane spell failure you want to take of armour and shield before casting (at 95% failure rate don't bother trying) and basides of that: you don't exactly get a big spellbook of \"combat\"-spells: mostly you get pre-fight buffing (Bulls strenght, Endurance, ...) and some \"convenience-spells\" (find traps, identify, ...)<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd rather get UMD up to 40 and depending on the environment dump some points in heal - however that depends a lot on how plentifull healing kits vs potions vs friendly clerics are.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi Karl - thank you and welcome!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou're quite right about taking RDD8 or WM8 at level 20. My thinking was skewed perhaps by playability rather than power-gaming (I'm an SP module player, rather than a PW participant). And having just developed one build that matures later than I'd like, I'm trying to put the brake on that, as I see Ki Critical as bringing more earlier than 1 skill point overall. Glad you caught it, though!<br/>\n<br/>\nGood info about whether Perform needed a modified check or not, so 13 (15) it is. Thanks (and of course that's 2 skill points saved!).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the feats...I was always going to be taking EWF, Armor Skin and Epic Prowess. The question was more about when and how. If I take all 3 of these as WM bonus feats it means at least 2 things. First, I don't get EWF until WM 16 - <em>**bugger! I've just realized I forgot about the WM bonus feat at 13 in my calculations!**.</em> Thus, my temptation now is to take Great Strengths at 24, 27, 30, 33 36 and 39, with EWF at level 21. That leaves EP and AS as bonus feats at levels 30 and 33, and the coward's way out of Epic Toughness 1 and 2 at 36 and 40 for an extra 40 HPs. Or I could go for a second WoC (again, spear or ms, depending what I take first) after taking a secondary WF in whichever weapon beforehand - though it would all be a tad late in the day.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt still doesn't resolve my head-scratching about pre-epic feats. My natural leanings are to take KD and BF, but there's a good case for Imp Crit (especially in a WM build) and taking Heavy Armour for better AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the skills...Aye, I get what you say about Lore. Concentration would be as a Taunt resistor rather than anything to do with combat casting. Looking over Hip's UMD Guide again, a modified 33 ranks in UMD should be more than enough here. So I might leave the 28 spare points to user's discretion - sometimes Heal will be good, sometimes Search, sometimes Conc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, many thanks - and great to have you on board!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT:</strong></em> Just realized in light of the above f**k-up, I could start with a STR of 17 (dropping CON to to 10 and CHA to 11) and ending it with STR 42 (with all 7 general epic feats as Great Strengths, CON ending at 12 and CHA at 13). That way I get EWF, AS and EP as WM bonus feats at 30, 33 and 36 and Epic Tough at 40. Yes, a few HPs, some bard song bonuses and 1 Fort save are lost, but the AB, damage and Disc gain 1. So, still a little unclear...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Knockdown, Heavy armour &amp; Martial/ Exotic weapons.<br/>\nThat particular split would also give intermediate points to boost your umd, taunt &amp; other bard skills instead of waiting for 20+ levels to do so.<br/>\nThat's what I would do anyway &amp; I would be happy with \"Only\" 48 AB or so.\n</div></blockquote>\nErr... Details? When would you get Exotic weapons and the rest? Also, how would you pick which class for which level?\n</div></blockquote>\nExotic weapons should come at the beginning, of course, you just add three bard levels in between 15th &amp; 40th level and gain an 11th level bard song in the process,<br/>\nGoing for more bard levels than 11 though its a trap because you need at least 19 weapon-master ones for the three essential bonus epic feats (EP, EWF &amp; AS).<br/>\nTake all the good feats that you want for your character (blind-fight, improved critical, heavy armour etc) and then take Gr. Strengths with what is left.<br/>\nIt will still be a really good build with high ab/dmg, weapon-master criticals, superior ac &amp; umd, bard-song, taunt etc.<br/>\nYou just make it way more playable.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: And don't bother with EDR in this build, go for straight ab/dmg.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I don't get more feats. Although, if I drop EDR, I get some more feats.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
