Try KD/IKD instead of Exp/IE.  If you play on a mid-high magic server, you'll want to use kama instead of gloves so you don't lose an item's worth of enchantments, just something to think about.<br/>\n<br/>\n Dante</div>"

Take the pre-epic level of Monk early, like level 3 or so, and focus on kamas.\u00a0 You'll have to reshuffle the feats and replace Toughness, Expertise, and Improved Expertise with WF Kamas, TWF and Ambidexterity. It is your call whether you want to replace Improved Critical with ITWF. Also, take Epic Prowess before Armor Skin because your AC is pretty good but your AB is only so-so. In the end, your AB will be the same, but your AC will be 2 higher, and you get immunity to poison, Monk speed, and late-but-free KD/IKD.</div>",

      "content": "<div>well once you work with the CBC (character build calculator) a few hundred times and have studied builds, much of the limiting factor comes in clicking the drop downs. \u00a0:)<br/>\n<br/>\n but you made it sort of easy - you wanted 20 levels of paladin and then said enough levels of monk/rogue to get epic dodge, which means either rogue 13 and some more monk/paladin or rogue 10 monk 9 with 1 level to spare. \u00a0Not knowing how easy XP was where you were playing, I split the monk and rogue evenly to avoid xp penalty. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n For the feats, I've mentally grouped pre-epic feats into several groups<br/>\n<br/>\n required: weapon focus, weapon finess if dex build<br/>\n almost required: blind fight<br/>\n should work in: improved critical, KD, IKD<br/>\n fit in if room: toughness, expertise<br/>\n<br/>\n now those are just general, specific feats like pre-reqs or dual-wield feats become required for certain builds obviously. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n for melee PCs post epic, I start with wanting EWF, EP, armor skin, and 6 great X (str or dex). \u00a0That's 9 feats, so in addition to your 7 generals, you'll need at least 2 bonus feats to get that, not counting any other desired epic feats.<br/>\n<br/>\n For this build for starting stats, you needed 14 WIS and you wanted your dex as high as possible, but still have room for other stats, so I knew from experience that 18 might be tough, so I started with 16. \u00a0Con and int 14 left 0 for strength. \u00a0That felt really solid. \u00a0If you wanted to squeeze one more AB and AC (and reflex save) out of the build, you could start with 18 dex and cut str to 8 and con and int to 12 (don't think there's any feats with int requirements), but that would cost you 40 hp, 43 skill points, 1 damage, and 1 fort save.<br/>\n<br/>\n for the epic stats, since my build doesn't have any bonus feats in epic (except for rogue which you need to use for defensive roll) and you're adding in epic dodge, I knew you needed EWF and Epic dodge. \u00a0that left 5 slots for EP, armor skin, and great dex feats. \u00a0Without knowing about the environment, my first thought was you have +8 AB from spells, so take Armor skin over EP, thought your AB is low at 41. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n the skills were pretty straightforward - take discipline, 40 tumble, and ~35 umd for sure. \u00a0Listen and spellcraft are useful and taunt can be. \u00a0for the extra 56 points, you probably want max concentration for rebuffing divine favor mid battle (forgot that skill). \u00a0So 16 skill points left. \u00a0if you want more for rogue skills, you could get rid of taunt. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n So that was my thought process and it took about 5ish mins, with a few more minutes entering things into the spreadsheet. \u00a0Maybe 10.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n EDIT - I forgot extend spell in my list - swap that out for toughness and probably move it up the list (move improved crit or ITWF down). \u00a0Extended Divine favor is your friend!</div>"
