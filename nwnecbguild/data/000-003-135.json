      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hi all.<br/>\n<br/>\n Long time NWN player, but new to the Arelith server so some help would be appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\n I am looking for a Ranger archer build. Following the build request guidlines, here is what I need<br/>\n<br/>\n 1) PvE build. I dont plan on doing any PvP if I can help it as I generally suck at it.<br/>\n 2) Level Cap - 30<br/>\n 3) Race - Elf<br/>\n 4) Class - Ranger. I dont mind multiclassing, but there is a minimum 3 level requirement for any second classes. i.e. the first 3 levels of second class need to be taken one after the other and you need a minimum of 3 levels in that secondary class<br/>\n 5) Ranged Longbow prefered. Maybe with a rapier for those times when you get swarmed.<br/>\n 6) Dex prefered over WIS wrt to ranged stat.<br/>\n 7) Longbow (bit of a silly question this)<br/>\n 8) Arelith is a low magic world. +3 on items/weapons is max<br/>\n 9) Spells will be ranger spells as needed. no need to focus on the casting side of things.<br/>\n 10) Custom factors = I plan taking the Sniper path, this removes the rangers dual wield feats and replaces them with Called Shot, Point Blank Shot and Rapid Shot. There is thus no need to include these feats in the build. If at all possible, a list of what to take as FE would be appreciated as I am brand new to the server so am not sure on what racial types are the most common.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanking you all in advance<br/>\n Piggy<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
