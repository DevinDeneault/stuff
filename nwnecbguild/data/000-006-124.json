      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Monk/AA is one of my favourite build archetypes due to it's versatility, I'm posting this build since I haven't seen this particular class spread on the ECB. The build is primarily made for low/medium magic PvP but it works well in most environments.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has +10 enchanted arrows, Mind Spell Immunity, Monk Speed, 30 SR, and Empty Body with a total duration of 4 minutes. The main advantage this build has over other Monk/AA spreads such as Monk9/Wiz2/AA29 is increased speed, Empty Body, and Mind Spell Immunity. If you have access to items with Mind Spell Immunity and Improved Invisibility on your server then this build isn't worth choosing over other Monk/AA spreads.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main problem with this build is the low damage, it works best on worlds where arrows have bonus damage. The AB is low for an AA but it still has decent AB compared to most builds.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Monk/AAs I choose the class spread and ability/feat choices separately, since almost any combination of decent class spread and decent ability/feat choices makes for a good Monk/AA. The Monk20/Wiz1/AA19 class spread can easily be built as a STR focused Dev Crit archer or a WIS focused zen archer, however other Monk/AA spreads such as Monk9/Wiz2/AA29 or Monk10/Wiz3/AA27 are better choices for STR/WIS focused archers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI chose Generalist for the Wizard level, you can choose to be a specialist for an extra True Strike per day at the cost of access to spell scrolls from your restricted school.<br/>\nIt's possible to fit in Weapon Finesse by dropping other feats (such as ESF: Listen/Spot or Toughness), but the melee AB will be very low so personally I don't think it's worth doing. The main purpose of ESF: Listen/Spot is to help when fighting sneakers in PvP. If your server is predominantly PvM with few sneaker mobs then there is no real loss in dropping them for other feats. You can get ISR feats to improve your SR beyond 30 but since the limit is only 44 SR I wouldn't recommend it.<br/>\nBy swapping Heal and Listen/Spot for Hide/MS it's possible to give this build decent stealth skills, although whether it's worth getting them or not depends on your server. The 11 ranks in Lore are leftover skill points, they can be moved elsewhere with no issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nClass: Monk 20 / Wizard 1 / Arcane Archer 19<br/>\nRace: Elf<br/>\nAlignment:

In my experience avoiding flatfootedness is easy as long as you're using a decent build and paying attention, Uncanny Dodge rarely matters to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nLosing 1 feat isn't a big deal for most Monk/AA builds, but swapping -1 AB and lower Reflex saves for better detect alone isn't a good trade in my opinion.

The best to date is overwhelming DR combined with regen and overwhelming force (attack damage and AB).\u00a0 These builds still do not come anywhere near the others against the End Bosses.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">The main reasons for being flatfooted are combat feats (Knockdown, Sap, Stunning Fist), magic (most hold/stun spells, WoF, Sunburst, etc), stealth (including Darkness, HiPS, and Invisibility), or just not being in combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nKnockdown and Sap can be resisted with high AC or high Discipline (and immunities in some environments). Most balanced environments provide enough Discipline gear for these feats to be ignored by a properly built and geared character against most opponents, although it's very rare to be completely immune to combat feats through Discipline alone. Stunning Fist can be resisted with high AC, high DR (partially), immunities, or a very high Fortitude save. This is usually the most difficult combat feat to deal with but there are still ways to protect against it.<br/>\n<br/>\nCasters are a huge threat in low/medium magic worlds but are simply threats in high magic worlds, so this depends on both your build and your environment. In general if you're fighting a mage or caster cleric in PvP and aren't prepared for fighting a mage or caster cleric you will die, flatfootedness is rarely the main issue for this matchup. Against battle clerics or druids this is less of an issue, although Word Of Faith is still a pain to deal with if your character can't remove the blindness effect. Most disabling spells have saves or can be blocked via immunities, the biggest problems in this category are the Bigby line and Word Of Faith. This means your build will have a problem if it has low saves or isn't equipped to fight casters, but there are still ways to deal with flatfootedness via spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nStealth is fairly self-explanatory, you are flatfooted when an unseen opponent attacks you. If your build is not built to fight sneakers you can't really complain when you lose to sneakers, this one depends entirely on the build you are playing. See Invisiblity and Ultravision or vanilla True Seeing are trickier since access to those spells isn't universal. However most balanced environments will provide some access to them for non-casters, even if it is only available to characters with UMD.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, going flatfooted due to not being in combat. There are multiple reasons this could happen, going flatfooted after killing the only target in melee range, getting ambushed while running around corners, misclicking when running or fighting, simply being distracted, etc. In some cases (such as corner sneaking) abusing this is a normal part of PvP tactics, but all of them can be prevented by just paying attention when you're fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo to sum up: have a high AC or high Discipline (or both), appropriate detect (including spells), decent saves, don't fight casters, and pay attention. On every server I've played on all of my PvP builds had at least the first 3 points covered, although unfortunately avoiding casters isn't always possible. I usually relax my building standards for PvM but almost all of my PvM builds have the first 3 points covered unless there is an environment-specific reason not to (such as immunities on items or monsters not using stealth).<br/>\n<br/>\nI've never played on WoG, but I imagine that your biggest problems as a dragon were fighting high level casters and getting hit by mobs with very high AB and KD. I don't know if vanilla TS has been removed from Dragon Shape on WoG in addition to the changes to the spell, but sneaker mobs could potentially be an issue too.<br/>\nTaking ESF: Discipline results in roughly 75ish Discipline while shifted, which isn't enough for resisting very high AB KD attempts but can protect against KD attempts from mobs with +60 AB or less. The build has 25 base Fortitude due to the pre-epic spread, so even without Epic Fortitude it stands a decent chance against Stunning Fist if your opponent isn't a dedicated stunner. I don't know how common Stunning Fist is on WoG, but 42 Fortitude with just +12 CON is a decent starting point (or at least it's a decent starting point if item merging has been altered to allow saves to stack properly).<br/>\nCasters will always be a problem for dragon builds, however high saves and immunities protect you from the worst effects. If you have access to Dispel Magic potions (or can brew your own) then you shouldn't have much issues with flatfootedness due to caster mobs. Actually beating caster mobs is another matter, but at least being flatfooted won't be the issue.<br/>\nStealth depends on whether vanilla True Seeing has been removed, but even with just +20 Spot from TS (which I believe is the WoG change) your dragon can easily reach 80ish Spot. Getting ESF: Spot raises it to 90ish, although you will need to be an elf to be an effective spotter. The World Ender is a Dru32/Figh2/Monk6, so even without TS that is still 60ish Listen, 70ish with ESF: Listen.<br/>\nThe sheer size of your character when shifted is honestly the main problem I think Dragon Shape builds face with regards to flatfootedness. Clicking yourself is a very easy mistake to make and it causes most actions to cancel, leading to flatfootedness. Other than managing your camera angle there isn't much that can be done about this issue, although this is just a natural part of playing a Dragon Shape build.<br/>\nAdding ESF: Discipline, (potentially) Epic Fortitude, ESF: Listen or ESF: Spot, and Brew Potion would be fairly easy changes to the build that help protect against flatfootedness.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
