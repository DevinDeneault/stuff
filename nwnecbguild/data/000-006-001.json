I never played an assassin there so cannot confirm or disprove that claim.\u00a0 If that is the case that the class has been redesigned from the default, you will need at least Search of 23 to accomplish that.\u00a0 On most servers, though, assassin dynamics have not been customized to become a psuedo-rogue as far as traps are concerned.<br/>\n<br/>\n I am assuming, with death attack, this toon will be equipping as much +INT gear as possible and buffing with Fox pots to increase the DC so that will also help spot epics but if you have ranks to spare, the boost will spot that much faster.\u00a0 The modified targets for deadlies are -- to recover all but gas: 21 and to set all but gas: 15.\u00a0 The current skill configuration does not provide anywhere near trap handling of epic versions except for spotting them if the PW has modified assassin to even do that much.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Tear your hair, gnash your teeth, bitch, moan, complain and resist in the hopes that someone will build a game similar to NWN (most custom environments have attained exactly that) that includes your own bias.\u00a0 Incidentally, several servers have changed the impact of \"intentional\" alignment change to include, among the many scripted consequences: lost XP, lost levels, loss of access to certain stores, loss of guild status, etc. to punish such mendacity on the part of the player.\u00a0 Those Fallen Pallies have more to lose than just a religious banning.<br/>\n<br/>\n For me, I like NWN \"as is\".\u00a0 Always have.

I soloed Aielund, and that went well until somewhere in act 4 where some packs of true-seeing demi-god mages proved too tough for a lone stealther. Guess I could have found a way to beat them, but I was not in the mood to explore every option then.<br/>\n<br/>\n @Stag: For evil Rp, you don't have to act like you just arrived from the abyss. It will be convincing if you play as neutral and act evilly at critical points of the storyline. That's how \"evil\" real life humans do, anyway. They are often reasonable to deal with and may even be nice from time to time. Looking into the psychology of psychopathy and get some inspiration may also be helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\n Edit: <em>Today I found new inspiration to finish this old Aielund save, and I did find a way to beat act 4 almost solo.

I wonder if the scripters put as much thought in as the players? So, play like Tony Soprano or Dexter, then! (I was going to say Donald Trump, but saw the lunacy of that in time.)<br/>\n<br/>\n I <em>am</em> still looking at a Monk/Ranger/SD build as threatened, and as we speak, but have one quick question (which should probably be posted in the General Discussion forum, but, as I've got you...). While I understand your Kama-Shinobi won't get hit for xp penalties (2 prestige classes), would my proposed counterpoint encounter them, given no Wiz?

I'm guessing this is environment specific, but having decided to follow an earlier suggestion of taking Weapon Focus in Kama at level 9 and pushing all the dual-wields back, I changed my mind. This was down to my picking up some Gloves of Fire +3 during the Exiled Knight quest (which, it transpires, can be done without undue goodness additions), while only having a +2 and +1Kama. You can do the sums, but it seems to me that Mick was bang on with the sequence of his feats, in Aielund at least. Except that\u00a0 I'll be taking WF in Kama at level 15, and delaying Imp 2-Weapon Fighting until level 18. Nonetheless, smart decisions on using different potential weapons, Mick (anyone would think he knew what he was doing).<br/>\n<br/>\n I've been cautioned about my Assassin status when I hit 21 on the evil-good spectrum, but have dragged it back down to 19 now (with 91 in law) - and that's without taking advantage of the psychology of pathology, Mick!

Blackguard could take, in 25 lvls, 5 bonus talents: improved sneak attacks, reaching the same 13d6 but with 4 sneak attacks in the first flurry: 52d6.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you lose, and what do you gain? <br/>\nA DC 38 death attack. Heavy price, I know, but I feel that in most servers a lvl40 foe will be either immune, or have high fortitude (except, well, exceptions). Heavy price, I agree, but not as heavy as I first thought when I took into account server \"reality.\" [Edit: and you can forego INT a bit, giving you small side benefits]<br/>\nYou could take 10 monk levels to max tumble, since Blackguard doesn't need 26. Imho SD 6 is not worth it, if you take into account quality of life: too situational, 3/day, 5 rounds.<br/>\nYou lose the 4 bonus Gr. Dex, alright. But you gain BAB (pre-20). You lose 2 AC, but you would get +1 AC from monk 10.<br/>\nAnd the HP; you would roll the d10 dice. It'd be 104 more max HP.<br/>\nSaving throws: you lose a lot of reflexes, but you have high dex. With blackguard, fortitude goes up, much needed. Evasion would be less efficient, but with improved evasion and higher HP you can survive it.<br/>\nYou postpone Epic Dodge for one level.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know it would be a different build, and I'll maybe post it as a tribute to yours, Mick, but I'm very interested in the opinion of the sacred dragons hanging out in this forum.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You attack unprepared and flat-footed targets from stealth:<br/>\n42d6 damage and forcing the target to save 3 times against a DA DC of 38 (44\u00a0with full buffs)\u00a0in a single flurry of attacks is no laughing matter - and\u00a0is what makes this build lethal.<br/>\nHIPS even let you \"rinse and repeat\".<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

A high AB helps land all those attacks, and is especially important since he dual wields his weapons.\u00a0He has Improved KD and deals full DA damage when the targets\u00a0are prone. The shere\u00a0number of attacks will also add up to a considerable\u00a0damage, even if you are unable to deal DA damage. This gets better in mid/high magic environments where better weapon properties add to the damage.<br/>\nHe has Stunning fist with a DC of 32 as a back-up plan to stun creatures that are immune to the DA paralysis. Hasted and with Flurry of blows active he has 7 attacks per round when unarmed for 3 Stunning fist attempts with his first blow. The unarmed AB is 39, which is\u00a0what you expect from\u00a0a\u00a0strong monk build.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe defence is very good even without AS. The naked and mundane\u00a0AC is 34. Add enhanced armor/natural/deflection/dodge AC to this and add +6 AC from max dexterity bonus\u00a0 and +6 AC from maxed wisdom bonus. If the Shield spell is modified to give shield AC, you can also add that. <br/>\nHe has an undispellable Improved invisibility that secures 50% concealment, with a 50% miss chance. This makes the SC feats unnecessary.<br/>\nEpic dodge cancels the first successful attack made against him in each round, (or the first attack of opportunity). <br/>\nHe is fast: 130% of normal speed. If you have Haste items or can cast the spells Expeditious retreat or Mass haste, you become super fast! If you stack the spells, you can virtually move with DM speed. <br/>\nThis secures a very quick approach for attack, sometimes even before the NPC target has time to react (fires his \"on perception\" script). It also secures a very quick retreat, if need be.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That's where I played the Kama-Shinobi, and I swapped Spot for Listen to my regret. Iirc Mick and I exchanged a couple posts about it either earlier in this thread or in the Aielund one - and annoyingly he was right yet again (I'd basically swapped because Monk also has Listen as a class skill, but doesn't have Spot). Arriving unannounced in a room full of invisible assassins (and I do mean full) and being able to locate them is very handy!<br/>\n<br/>\nTry playing this one as it is - it's a real joy.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Just checked, and the discussion about Listen and Spot takes place on pages 2 and 3 of this thread, and Hip is also involved.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It is sad to see it nerfed, but it does not hurt this build too much.<br/>\nIt is worse with the DA nerf. The chances of landing paralyzing attacks is no longer multiplied in an attack flurry. You still paralyze your targets, especially when the assassin levels begin to stack up, but it doesn't work as consistently as it used to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe DA nerf has made the rogue class even more relevant than before in stalker builds. Even so, the assassin class can help you avoid an XP penalty, like in this build. You get \"SCV for free\" with the Improved invisibility class feature. You also get Great dex as an epic bonus feat, which can give a dedicated assassin build a higher AB than a similar rogue build, something I also use in this build. The DA can still paralyze targets, but not quite as consistently as before.<br/>\nRogue qualifies for Epic Dodge with its bonus feats, something assassin does not. Here, I circumvent that with class feats from monk and SD.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Yes, it costs, but by that stage you should be rich as Croesus anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know if you're soloing, but now might be a good time to make an exception. While Deekin is always vfm, both Nathyrra and Valen have their merits for this one. Valen wields his morning star to great effect (as well he should as a WM), while Nathyrra, with a good bow and +5 unlimited arrows using Rapid Shot is handy - particularly if you can afford to put +10 Mighty and +10AB on Taralash.<br/>\n<br/>\nGear-wise, Dragon Slippers are good (KD immunity), Ring of Greater Electrical Resistance helps against Gedlee's, Cowl of Warding works against Slow and Mind spells, while Belt of Guiding Light protects from Death magic.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon't forget that fighting the Maker is purely optional, and there's no consequence to just leaving him be.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
