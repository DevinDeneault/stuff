      "content": "<div>Hello All<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I've finally done it: I've played a battle-cleric through to level 37 (Aielund). And it is with a heavy heart that I have to say...I didn't hate it. This is probably down to the fact that I could mostly play her as a straight-up meleer. I did have to remember to buff every time I woke up, and I can't profess that I made full use of her short-term enhancements (primarily because I forgot), but by and large there wasn't as much faffing as I'd feared, so that was good. Oh, and I won't pretend I soloed her, having two companions throughout the campaign. Nevertheless, I think room can be made for her in this august forum. Just don't tell anyone else (especially Max), alright?<br/>\n<br/>\nDancing Sunbeam first emerged in the Build Request forum as <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/viewtopic.php?p=23704#p23704\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dancing Sunbeam</a>, where she began life as a Barbarian/ Cleric/ CoT. She would have resided there for eternity were it not for the patient counsel of Max (in particular) and others, to whom my gratitude goes in spades. There were two builds with similar classes and splits in the Guild Filter:\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-divinae-auxilium-cleric-26-cot-10-rogue-4-t515404.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Divinae Auxilium</a> by foojin (Cleric 26/ Rogue 4/ CoT 10) is the first, but is a DEX Zen Archer; while the second is\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/linu-la-neral-cleric-29-cot-10-bard-1-t2269037.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Linu La'neral</a> from Max, our very own Cleric-master, and is his interpretation of the OC's clumsy elf Cleric sidekick and is a Cleric 29/ CoT 10/ Bard 1. Linu is very nicely done, but also has a CHA boost so is stretched a bit thinner stat-wise.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are an inveterate melee-merchant like me, this might actually be a Cleric starter kit you could use.

      "content": "<div>Hey there, Stag!\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn't have expected anything less from you, my friend! Any Cleric built by you should resemble a meathead LOL!\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a few questions / comments about some of the choices you made in this build:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- Stat increases: the reason you want to increase WIS is to be able to cast spells, but of course, in this build, that means you will need to wait until epics for level 7+ spells. So, since you take so many of your regular feats as Great Wisdom, why not just take all CoT levels except one as soon as you reach level 21 to reach 19 WIS ASAP, swapping around the STR increases for WIS so you can have access to level 9 spells? I mean taking CoT levels from 21 (stopping at 23 for the Tumble and UMD dump), then continuing until you get 19 WIS? It'd look something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n21- CoT 4: GW1 (17)<br/>\n22- CoT 5<br/>\n23- R2: (Evasion and skill dumps)<br/>\n24- CoT 6: W+1, GW2 (19)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis way you'd have 9th level spells at level 24, instead of 29 as it is. I think in this case you should prioritize getting at least 18 WIS since you don't have level 9 spells with 16 levels of Cleric, then, and only then, start focusing on STR. I know you don't cast as much, but if other people play her, no reason for them not to enjoy her full potential ASAP, right? Just because you don't normally use some VERY POTENT weapons in her arsenal, it doesn't make them any less potent. I believe you'd call that faffing LMAO.<br/>\n<br/>\n2- Class split: Why not go with 26/4/10 for an extra +1 to all saves, same number of feats, more skill points and an extra epic skill dump, losing only 3 totally irrelevant caster levels? I think you actually created a problem for yourself here because the Cleric Bonus Feat list is less attractive for this character than the CoT list, and basically you robbed yourself of 2 CoT levels and 1 Rogue level for 3 Cleric levels that add very little if anything at all. As an example, if you did go with my suggested spread, you could continue the progression I suggested above as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\n25- CoT 7:<br/>\n26- CoT 8: EWF<br/>\n27- CoT 9: EP<br/>\n28- CoT 10: AS<br/>\n<br/>\nThis means that, at level 28, you'd have all your main Epic Combat Feats, rather than much later as you have here. It's true that a build like this one doesn't really need the extra hit chance, with all the buffs and all else, but still, something to keep in mind. Or you could start focusing on Cleric levels to reach indispellability sooner, and save that sequence for later. But, at least you'd have options, better options IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than these minor comments, a rock solid build, as one would expect from a veteran ECB member, such as yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nKudos!</div>",
