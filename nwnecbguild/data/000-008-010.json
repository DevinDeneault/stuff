You exert control over the natural world. There is little that can harm you when you use your magics.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe student sighed. He knew this was coming. He had spent several years in the company of this wizard who had proven to be an excellent tutor. \"I do not doubt the power of magic; in fact, I agree that there is little that can stand against a well trained magician.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Then what drives you to practice daily with your bow? Your aim is far more accurate with your spells. The effects are varied and flexible instead of the tiny piercing of an opponent's armor. An altogether better use of your time is studying how you can further master the forces of magic rather than hefting your arrows to and fro.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n\"You are untrained in the bow, or indeed, any weapon, master are you not? A weapon is not a separate thing; it is an extension of one's body. Is this not the definition of how you view magic?\"<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Of course, but it is not the same. You assume too much.\" In an instant the student plucked an arrow from his quiver and loosed it toward the old mage. Instinctively the mage deflected the arrow. An explosion of color followed, encasing the mage within a sphere of purple light. Unharmed but shaken, the mage tested his cage. \"What is this child?\"<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Master, the arrow only delivered the spell. You deftly deflected the bit of wood but not the varied and flexible effect. I think this is only the beginning.\" The old mage pursed his lips and slowly nodded to himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fledgling Eldritch Archer smiled shyly.<br/>\n<br/>\nCombining the art of the Elven Warbands with the dedication to the martial and arcane prowess of the Eldritch Knights, the Eldritch Archer is a versatile combatant with many options.<br/>\n<br/>\nWizard(6), Eldritch Knight(19),

\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Background, Analysis and Comments by Author</strong> <br/>\n<br/>\nEquipment<br/>\nLongbow<br/>\nRobes <br/>\n<br/>\nEldritch Archer Advantages<br/>\nAvariel traits. The Eldritch Archer is a free-spirited, rare elf breed who possesses beauty and prowess not seen in normal elves.<br/>\n Avariel Ability Adjustments: +4 Dex, +2 Int, +2 Wis, -2 Con. <br/>\n<br/>\nSleeplessness: Immune to spells and effects of the 'Sleep' subtype. <br/>\nHardiness vs. Enchantments: +2 racial bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting spells. Skill Affinity (Listen): +2 racial bonus to Listen checks.<br/>\n Bonus Proficiencies (Longsword, Rapier, Shortbow, Longbow)<br/>\n Skill Affinity (Listen): +2 racial bonus to Listen checks.<br/>\nSkill Affinity (Search): +2 racial bonus to Search checks.<br/>\nSkill Affinity (Jump): +4 racial bonus to Jump checks.<br/>\nKeen Sight: +4 racial bonus to Spot checks.<br/>\nKeen Senses: Avariel make active Search checks automatically and with no movement penalties.<br/>\nDive: +2 attack while suffering -2 to armor class. A successful attack does double damage if using a piercing weapon.<br/>\nLow-Light Vision: Allows them to see better than normal in the dark.<br/>\nElven: Avariel are considered Elven for the purpose of spells.<br/>\nLevel 9 Arcane Spells, and 52 Epic Spells (almost all of which he can cast relatively effortlessly - i.e. he will make her spell craft check on a reliable basis). These spells allow the Eldritch Archer to utilize the strength of the arcane on his opponents, rather than just his prowess with a bow alone. He can perform tricks that are beyond most studiers of the arcane, such as: <br/>\nContingent Ressurection (epic spell). If the Eldritch Archer (or a chosen ally) is slain in battle, his energy is automatically rechanneled to allow him (or a chosen ally) to be born anew, so long as he prepared the ritual. <br/>\nChampion's Valor (epic spell). The Eldritch Archer can invoke the power of the arcane to become immune to Knockdown, Mind-Affecting spells, Critical Hits, and Sneak-Attacks.<br/>\nDeadeye Sense (epic spell). If the Eldritch Archer is having difficulty hitting a foe, he can invoke the power of the divine to be able to have the sense of a true predator, invoking the Deadeye Sense, giving him +20 to his attack bonus for a good amount of time.<br/>\nArmy Unfallen (epic spell). The Eldritch Archer can completely heal himself and all of his allies, as well as resurrect all fallen allies in a large radius.<br/>\nHe also has access to all of the standard arcane spells, and has many uses per day of each due to a good INT score.<br/>\nGood DCs on spells. The Eldritch Archer has a sufficient INT score allowing him to cast spells with great proficiency.<br/>\nGood Caster Level. The Eldritch Archer casts as a level 29 wizard.<br/>\nHigh Armor Class (although not extremely high). As a Dex-based character, the Eldritch Archer has a good AC.<br/>\nVery versatile due to spellcasting.<br/>\nGood AB. With a +47 without any buffs at all, the Eldritch Archer is no slouch when it comes to his attack bonus.<br/>\n<br/>\nEldritch Archer Disadvantages<br/>\nLow Damage with bow without magical enhancements. For an Archer, the Eldritch Archer cannot deal high damage - only 1D8+6 damage on base attacks. This can be enhanced magically, but it is still pretty low for an archer.<br/>\nIf made from scratch, he must endure many hardships to gain his epic spells once he has reached epic levels. Much sacrifice is required to gain epic spells.<br/>\nVery low HP.<br/>\nLow Un-buffed Saving Throws.<br/>\n<br/>\nMagic Item Wish List<br/>\nA Composite Bow and +Str, +Dex, +Con, and +Int items.<br/>\nA permanently hasted item. Who would say no to an increased movement rate, +4 to AC, an extra spell per round, and an extra attack?<br/>\nAC boosting items. With his mediocre hit points, an even higher AC is important.<br/>\nSpellcraft boosting items. With more Spellcraft, he can learn more epic spells and also cast epic spells easier. With more Spellcraft, because of his high insight within the arcane world, he can learn even the most difficult of epic spells.<br/>\nSaving throw boosting items. Although, with spells, his saving throws can be decent, they are not reliable enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nKey Stats<br/>\n<br/>\nFinal Saves (Vs. Spells)<br/>\nFortitude: 23 (35)<br/>\nReflexes: 27 (39)<br/>\nWill: 18 (30)<br/>\n<br/>\nFinal Saves (Vs. Spells) [BUFFED (+12 con/dex/wis &amp; recitation/divine protection)]<br/>\nFortitude: 29 (42)<br/>\nReflexes: 33 (46)<br/>\nWill: 24 (37)<br/>\n<br/>\nFinal AC (Buffed / Unbuffed)<br/>\nUnbuffed, 25<br/>\nSelf-Buffed (Epic Mage Armor, Shield, Shadow Shield, Mantle of Egregious Might, Haste) = 64<br/>\nBuffed fully (EMA, Shield, Shadow Shield, +12 Dex, Mantle of Egregious Might, Haste) = 68<br/>\nWith Ring of Protection +5 = 73<br/>\n<br/>\nAB and Damage<br/>\nWith no buffs, normal longbow:<br/>\n47/42/37/32 1D6+8 (19-20 X3) <br/>\nWith +12 Str, +12 Dex, +6 mighty +5 enhancement longbow and +5 arrows:<br/>\n59/54/49/44 1D6+19 (19-20 X3)<br/>\nMaximum AB with longbow 73</div>"
