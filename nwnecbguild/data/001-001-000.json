I don\u2019t know if every one here has played this series, but the series is so good that i can\u2019t resist the urge to post a recommendation for it.For more detail about the mod please refer to the link below, which covers the series quite informatively.\u00a0\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://lilura1.blogspot.com/2015/02/swordflight-series-part-i.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://lilura1.blogspot.com/2015/02/swo ... art-i.html</a>\u00a0PS: I am not the author of this blog.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A quote from the coverage above, to give you a quick rundown of what Swordflight is all about.Realmslore, reactivity, resource management, rest restrictions, replayability, quest density, non-linearity, meat-grinder dungeons, TOUGH AS NAILS COMBAT.This is Swordflight - and it's peerless.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For me, Swordflight is hard and satisfying in the same time. I finished the Chapter II two months ago and was informed by the author that Chapter III would come out soon.The series is quite new compared to the Aielund Saga and for that reason bears many merit in design which i appreciate a lot.\u00a0I recommend everyone give it a try and you will not regret your time spend, especially when you reach the Chapter II. \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

This is a good set of modules to highlight.<br/>\n<br/>\n Back in 2010-2011 I was helping rogueknight test out Chapter 1.\u00a0 He claimed that it was designed for fighter types but I showed how many other classes can have fun and even dominate.\u00a0 Don't know if my feedback evolved into altering the original design or not (he was trying to make it really tough for non-fighters) but it's an all-around notable piece of work everyone should try out.\u00a0 He won an AME award back in 2009 for RP value of Chapter One and the fact that it used only vanilla resources (In Chapter Two, he used some fancier tilesets but you still don't need CEP to play it and the story, as usual, is great.).<br/>\n<br/>\n Here are the Vault links:<br/>\n<strong><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/module/swordflight-chapter-one\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#0000FF\">Swordflight Chapter One</span></a></strong><br/>\n<strong><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/module/swordflight-chapter-two\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#0000FF\">Swordflight Chapter Two</span></a></strong><br/>\n<br/>\n Check the date on Lilura's Blog closer, though: Feb 2015 with no recent comments.\u00a0 But am trying to stay positive because I'd love to play more of rogueknight's work and this summer would be a perfect time for me.\u00a0 I choose to believe you got some hot insider information, Mate! <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Have thus just downloaded parts 1 and 2 of Swordflight, which seems to have rave reviews everywhere, so thanks for the recommendation, Vecho! Think I'll go with a STR-based Monk - I need something familiar to play with (titters from the cheap seats) while attempting both Cleric and Barbarian for the first time<br/>\n<br/>\n Most noteworthy, however, was that I managed a successful download, first time, without coming to the ECB Guild wringing my hands and pleading for help!<br/>\n<br/>\n I also checked Lilura's blog, and, as at the end of July (this year!)

Now you have your own thread for status reports away from the hussle-bussle of tech problem solvers.<br/>\n<br/>\n Rogueknight may not remember anymore, but I was one of the responders on the old IGN Vault project page for the first module.\u00a0 He claimed it was designed for fighter types which I took as a challenge and ended up testing all sorts of classes successfully, reporting my experiences on that old forum thread.\u00a0 We had a lot of fun exploring aspects of the design (I dabble a bit myself in the design department).\u00a0 I can't help but wonder if any of our discussions affected the subsequent offerings.

Time, how it flies..!<br/>\n<br/>\n 1) Fixed a bug allowing one in some conversational paths to see Kalomas Zekar as part of Hamad's quests, before doing the quest involving him assigned by Zarala, potentially introducing some bugs.<br/>\n 2) Fixed a bug that sometimes resulted in Kelem/Chelys being in Stealth and thus very difficult to find when met for a second time in the Desert Dragon Tavern.<br/>\n 3) Fixed a conversational option of the friendly ogre in the Marching Mountains cave which had the wrong conditional script and did not always appear on the correct occasions.<br/>\n 4) Tweaked the alterations to the Gate spell slightly.<br/>\n 5) Miscellaneous minor tweaks and fixes, such as correcting typos.<br/>\n<br/>\n If you're not far into the third chapter then I would probably just start over, yeah.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You can gain foreknowledge by consulting the walkthroughs, I suppose.<br/>\n<br/>\n Btw, it's best to ask these sorts of questions on the Swordflight neverwintervault.org entries (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/tags/swordflight\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://neverwintervault.org/tags/swordflight</a>) in order to get a response from Rogueknight himself, who I don't think is registered here.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'm now playing a half-orc, barbarian, ranger, rogue and he seems to be holding up pretty well. The initial henchman issue was actually an interesting touch but I just ended up letting her die over and over otherwise it would have been way too much of a drain on resources. The only other things I would quibble about so far are (spoiler alert) the alignment shifts toward evil for things that are not really evil like stealing which I would rate more as chaotic depending on what is stolen, who it is stolen from and the manner in which it is stolen. I also thought it was a bit jarring seeing a 7 foot tall gnoll (with a halberd dripping acid onto the floor) just casually standing in the middle of a tavern while no one bat's an eyelid but hey, some strange stuff happens in Faerun.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I really like is that it's set in Faerun, it's bloody challenging, it's huge in its scale, it is non linear and you can easily end up somewhere that you have to RUN AWAY from. I've had a few times where I've gotten so engrossed that I've forgotten to save, wandered into a really difficult fight and died. It definitely keeps you on your toes. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm considering putting points into intimidate due to the frequency of dialogue choices between persuade, intimidate and bluff. Incidentally, It has always annoyed me that intimidate is based solely on charisma. I think STR is more appropriate or a combination of STR and CHA and possibly INT or WIS for bluff. It has always seemed odd that all of the conversation skills are based solely on CHA. I guess it's for balance but I find it odd. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I'll need to figure out what skills to sacrifice somewhat. It's very difficult because the module is demanding, making it a real challenge to deal with the opportunity cost. Plus, I'm starting with a -2  modifier for CHA. But I feel pretty strongly that the game would open up significantly with a strong intimidate check. Any suggestions about how many points to sink into it?<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my G3125 using Tapatalk<br/>\n<br/>\n<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The modules are hard, and unusually well balanced for melee characters. Rest restrictions will make it hard for casters, but there are ways to circumvent that. It was a bit unusual that thievery gave an evil alignment change, and not the chaotic that we are used to, so be careful if you want to play a good aligned rogue. The death and respawn system is a bit unusual, but is in line with the story, and offers a \"pocket plane\" where you can recover before reentering the story where you left. Death has an xp and gold penalty though.<br/>\nThe first module was short, ending at lvl 5. I started out with a level 1 dex based ranger (yes, I do love the challenge). And that was an uphill battle all the way, always wanting better weapons and equipment, always wondering if I had enough potions to survive, and enough trap components to be able to deliver some punch in the next tough encounter. It added to the challenge that I had to baby-sit a hench-woman essential to the plot.<br/>\nThe second module is gigantic and offers a lot of free roaming. It has many optional quests and even class specific quests, but becomes more plot-driven after a while. The city has layers upon layers of of areas to explore. The final part on the other hand is far more linear. The module has several henchmen to choose between, but for the most part they are not forced upon you. The equipment gets far better in the late part. I think my character ended at level 16. <br/>\nPart 2 is one of the best modules I have ever played. It is challenging and rewarding, the plot line has the drive and depth of a good novel, and there are dialogue options that makes it natural to play all alignments.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'm still in the desert ruins, but the story and feel are off the charts! It's a little on the easy side given how little damage the enemies do, but less so than other Single Player modules. What makes it harder are the fact you need to fight many enemies at once, and there's a severe lack of safe resting spots, which for melee toons isn't a problem, but for casters might be a nightmare. I'm using Yoshimo (STR version) on this playthrough, and he's doing great! It's really low magic, so spending all your gold on consumables is absolutely essential! The only thing I don't like about it so far is the fact that you NEED Rogue skills so much, but being a sible player module, you can't rely on party members, and that henchwoman is, well, horrible LOL. I think that playing any non-rogue seems undoable without missing out on a lot of things from what I've seen so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, I'm very happy with the way the story is developing!

Even if your Taunt is low, all you need is to get lucky with your roll and you can attack the rats without penatlies. I'd also suggest spending all your gold on Barkskin Potions in chapter one.

I can't imagine doing swordflight chapter 1 without some rogue skills. I also highly recommend atleast 1 conversation skill as you miss out on tons of fun dialogue, extra rewards, and XP without them.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently just started Chapter 2, A flame berried, bulls strengthed, cats graced, barkskinned, awakened (from a rod), dire wolf is easily chewing through encounters with my main character tanking and taunting or shooting his +1 short bow with negative damage arrows. I also have found a lot of good conversational uses for animal empathy and quite a few strong animals to dominate so I recommend that skill for chapter 2.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy only annoyance is the build will end up with uneven dex, but from my scouting it seems I can only reasonably hit +9 dex bonus with shifter limitations in swordflights lootpool so I opted for the extra con and strength for an easier early game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother note: DO NOT play my build without serious shifter experience, the ac will only be equivalent to a strength based sword and shield character, so mediocre and the ab is also lackluster. The strengths are Druid scrolls, great druid gear available, combat useful social skills, a pile of immunitys and a strong weapon for a low magic module. Swordflight also has a massive amount of consumables of all types that don't require UMD, haste gear, and customizable gear which greatly benefit shifters.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeres my build for those curious:<br/>\n<br/>\nJarrok Grimgor, Uthgardt Outcast<br/>\nHuman<br/>\nNeutral Evil<br/>\nBarbarian 16/Druid 7/Shifter11<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nStr 11<br/>\nDex 17(25)<br/>\nCon 10<br/>\nInt 14<br/>\nWis 13<br/>\nCha 8<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n1 Barbarian1: Weapon Proficiency Exotic, Toughness<br/>\n2 Druid1<br/>\n3 Druid2: Expertise<br/>\n4 Barbarian2<br/>\n5 Druid3<br/>\n6 Druid4: Blindfight<br/>\n7 Barbarian3<br/>\n8 Druid5<br/>\n9 Barbarian4: Alertness<br/>\n10 Barbarian5<br/>\n11 Shifter1<br/>\n12 Shifter2: Weapon Focus: Greataxe<br/>\n13 Shifter3<br/>\n14 Shifter4<br/>\n15 Barbarian6 Weapon Focus: Scythe<br/>\n16 Shifter5<br/>\n17 Shifter6<br/>\n18 Shifter7: Improved Critical: Scythe<br/>\n19 Barbarian7<br/>\n20 Druid6<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nEPIC<br/>\n21 Shifter8: Armorskin<br/>\n22 Shifter9<br/>\n23 Shifter10<br/>\n24 Shifter11: Undead Shape<br/>\n25 Barbarian8<br/>\n26 Barbarian9<br/>\n27 Barbarian10: Epic Weapon Focus: Scythe<br/>\n28 Barbarian11<br/>\n29 Barbarian12<br/>\n30 Druid7: Epic Prowess<br/>\n31 Barbarian13<br/>\n32 Barbarian14<br/>\n33 Barbarian15: Terrifying Rage<br/>\n34 Barbarian16<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nSkill Points: 259<br/>\nAnimal Empathy 23(22), Craft Trap 19(21), Disable Trap 1(3), Discipline 37(37), Intimidate 37(36), Listen 37(41), Open Lock 1(8), <br/>\nSet Trap 1(8), Spellcraft 33(35), Taunt 37(36), Tumble 15(22)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nSkill Point Leveling Order:<br/>\n1 Craft Trap(2), Disable Trap (2), Discipline(4), Intimidate(4), Listen(4), Open Lock(2), Set Trap (2), Taunt(4), Tumble(4)<br/>\n2 Animal Empathy(3), Craft Trap(1), Spellcraft(3)<br/>\n3 Animal Empathy(3), Spellcraft(2), Tumble(2)<br/>\n4 Discipline(2), Intimidate(2), Listen(1), Taunt(2), <br/>\n5 Spellcraft(3), Tumble(2), Save(2)<br/>\n6 Save(9)<br/>\n7 Discipline(4), Intimidate(4), Listen(2), Taunt(4), Tumble(2)<br/>\n8 Animal Empathy(4), Save(3)<br/>\n9 Discipline(2), Listen(4), Taunt(2), Tumble(2)<br/>\n10 Discipline(1), Intimidate(3), Listen(2), Taunt(1)<br/>\n11 Animal Empathy(4), Listen(1), Tumble(2)<br/>\n12 Animal Empathy(1), Craft Trap(6)<br/>\n13 Animal Empathy(1), Craft Trap(3), Tumble(2), Save(1)<br/>\n14 Animal Empathy(1), Save(7)<br/>\n15 Discipline(5), Intimidate(2), Taunt(5), Tumble(2)<br/>\n16 Craft Trap(7)<br/>\n17 Animal Empathy(1), Tumble(2), Save(4)<br/>\n18 Save(11)<br/>\n19 Discipline(4), Taunt(4), Tumble(2), Save(8)<br/>\n20 Spellcraft(15)<br/>\n21 Animal Empathy(5), Tumble(2)<br/>\n22 Listen(7)<br/>\n23 Listen(5), Tumble(2)<br/>\n24 Save(7)<br/>\n25 Discipline(6), Taunt(6), Tumble(2)<br/>\n26 Discipline(1), Intimidate(2), Listen(3), Taunt(1)<br/>\n27 Discipline(1), Intimidate(2), Listen(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(2)<br/>\n28 Discipline(1), Intimidate(4), Listen(1), Taunt(1), Save(1)<br/>\n29 Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Listen(1), Taunt(1), Save(4)<br/>\n30 Spellcraft(10), Save(1)<br/>\n31 Discipline(2), Intimidate(3), Taunt(2)<br/>\n32 Discipline(1), Intimidate(5), Taunt(1)<br/>\n33 Discipline(1), Intimidate(4), Listen(1), Taunt(1)<br/>\n34 Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Listen(4), Taunt(1)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I really wish the regular minotaur form had a greataxe as well...<br/>\n<br/>\n<em class=\"mention\">@Stagmeister</em> <br/>\n<br/>\nI have indeed seen your shudder build and I think its probably the best level 40 version of the Dex primary Druid/Shifter/Barb combo I've seen posted.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I believe a Dwarf or Half-Orc Barbarian/Shifter/Druid with Epic Damage Reduction and Mighty Rage is the strongest version of the level 40 build but its a late bloomer and requires good access to Damage resist Slash/pierce/bludgeoning gear making it a poor choice for swordflight which only hits early epics and very weak and limited amounts of damage resist gear.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm planning to post a rough draft of that build once I am finished leveling it on World of Greyhawk once I've finished my playtest, but at level 32 its a monster.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
