I've been battling an addiction to WoW Classic (I know, for shame) but I've finally kicked the habit and am in need of panacea to keep me from falling back down that gods-awful rabbit hole. So with that in mind, I've decided that I don't care how difficult WoG is, I'm going to give it a real go this time around. But, since I don't want to /ragequit from constant death/respawn (which seems to be about all I've managed to do at WoG thus far) I'm turning to the members of this community to either point me toward, or build from scratch, a viable World of Greyhawk toon who won't constantly die every time he sets foot outside city limits.\u00a0<br/>\nYes, I know it's a difficult server, and I'm fine with that -- I'm just hoping for advice or a build that will give me a bit more survivability than I've heretofore experienced. That said, I'm not a big fan of mindless hack&amp;slash (I tend to favor arcane caster type builds) but I'm willing to branch out and try something new if that means I can play for more than 10 minutes at a time without dying. Also, I should mention that I'm looking for a character I can use solo rather than having to rely on bumping into random strangers who feel like grouping up. =)<br/>\nAny suggestions from the experts? As I said, I'm open to pretty much anything at this point that will give me a leg up in the World of Greyhawk.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n1)\u00a0PvM or PvP\u00a0- PvM<br/>\n<br/>\n2)\u00a0Level cap\u00a0- 40, preferably playable all the way through that journey<br/>\n<br/>\n3)\u00a0Race preference\u00a0- Surprise me!<br/>\n<br/>\n4)\u00a0Class preference\u00a0- I'm open to anything WoG allows<br/>\n<br/>\n5)\u00a0Melee preference\u00a0- Sure?<br/>\n<br/>\n6)\u00a0Range preference\u00a0- Maybe?<br/>\n<br/>\n7)\u00a0Weapon preference\u00a0- Whatever gets the job done<br/>\n<br/>\n8)\u00a0Maximum item enhancement\u00a0- Whatever WoG caps at.<br/>\n<br/>\n9)\u00a0Spellcasting\u00a0- Yes please, as long as I can sling spells and not just insta-die on WoG as a n00b. I'm totally open to Divine or Arcane, and even outside-the-box thinking like Recipro-Damage or Melee Mage spec.<br/>\n<br/>\n10)\u00a0Custom Factors - WoG, baby!\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi Noctem!<br/>\n<br/>\nI've played through several characters to 40 now<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers have played the server long than me though, I've played for about the last 5-6 months pretty solidly<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are looking for a new player friendly build to start playing in WoG solo, a Str or Zen Archer Cleric (Animal/Plant domains) / Rogue / Third Class or a Str Cleric / Bard / RDD (think Mithdradates's Blood and Faith) would be my suggestion<br/>\n<br/>\nThe empowered summons from the animal domain help you deal with difficult engagements early on much more easily than a melee fighter would be able to. It should be enough to get you through the early pre-epic levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nCats Grace / Barkskin from animal and plant respectively help boost your AC further (clerics have crazy AC boosting) when you are melee'ing more often around level 3-4+.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nLater on clerics get divine power and crazy AB boosting. Darkfire is a very nice spell. SoV and Implosion are handy against non-spell resistant enemies.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nUMD is very powerful in a mid magic PW to cast other spells such as Mind Blank (no mind immunity items exist)\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nMick Dagger's Spirit and Steel - Cleric 24/ Bard 16 I think would do very well although for WoG I would drop Still Spell/Auto Still I and II as there are a few -% arcanist runes and -%arcane chainmails floating around to reduce arcane spell failure. Its a build I'm yet to play test but is on my list (along with the x amount of unfinished builds I've made I havent playtested yet). I'd choose Animal Plant domains again for a new player<br/>\n<br/>\nI would start in Hommlet as the starting area. Try to 'pull' individual enemies to deal with them. As a soloist, if you get mobbed you usually end up dying.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there was some screenshot somewhere in either this forum or the WoG forum of some character running, nearly dead, from a bunch of giant frogs at level 2 - I think the response was 'don't worry, you're doing fine!'<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
