      "content": "<div>Hello.<br/>\nFirst of all, let me extend kudos to Grrizzled_dwarflord, Kail, Kaliban, Grimnir and all other excellent builders of this community. i'm a long time lurker and i did pick quite a few of my builds from among your creations.<br/>\nBut this time i need a custom made build for Arelith server (level cap at 30, low-mid magic, no dev. crit., no HiPS, multiclass dips must be 3 levels minimum)<br/>\ni want this character to be a classic adventurer. R. Howard style. buff, fast, durable, sneaky, skillfull and womanizing (can you be handsome with 8 Charisma?)<br/>\nmyself i was thinking of something like STR based 15 barbarian/15 rogue. or d/w 3 ranger/4 fighter/13 rogue (because rangers get cool tracking ability). the server is pretty low-magic and hence is dominated by casters. so it would be cool if this build had some shtick against them too (UMD is a must, of course) i am not against caster levels altogether, but i'd prefer not to rely on spells.<br/>\ni'd also appreciate if you gracious builders would give me some pro tips on successfully playing such a character. <br/>\nthanks in advance.</div>"

CoT gives him Epic Weapon Spec and some bonus to saves, not to mention a respectable Smite Evil, Divine Wrath and a Lay on Hands.  Fighter also gives him Heavy Armor proficiency that Barbarian doesn't grant.  He tops it off with a Lasting Inspiration, though it doesn't appear until Level 30.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Demos, thanks for your time and effort! this is truly a strong and versatile build and no doubts fun to play!<br/>\n..but it is not exactly what i wanted. he relies heavily on spells and has a heavy religious influence. <br/>\nif you have not read any Conan books, another example would be Rashemen dajemma warriors (the character will actually be of rashemi origin). maybe like Minsc (before he got hit on a head )?<br/>\ndo you think that builds i mentioned as examples are not viable? too weak? i'm not set on pure melee, but, as i said, he shouldn't ~heavily rely on self-buffing.<br/>\n<br/>\nalso, i was only half serious concerning high charisma, this is not a requirement really.</div>"
