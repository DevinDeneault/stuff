It's not intuitive, actually I would suggest a pure Fighter8, WM32 would max out your AB. Add some monk and you'll change some AB for AC, but still. Also heard something about Ranger 10, WM30, but that can't be right?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I guess the build I'm looking for is somewhere in the lvl 40 section, but which? There are so many.... Can I humbly ask for some guidance?</div>"
