      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">I've wanted to build a Bard 20/Monk 20 for some time. I'm still looking for a PW that will allow it, but this isn't quite that, as Arelith builds max out at 30.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, the possibility of Bard Song with Monk Speed is too good to pass up. Arelith also offers Quarterstaff as a Monk Weapon, meaning that the Two Weapon Fighting feats can be shaved, and I'm not using Kama.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was looking at a Dex based Bard 20/Monk 6/Paladin 4, but don't really know what I'm doing, so I'm pretty flexible on everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy firm requirements would be...<br/>\n<br/>\nLasting Inspiration <br/>\nCurse Song<br/>\nBlind Fight<br/>\nImproved Expertise (not sure why)<br/>\nMonk Speed<br/>\nGSF Transmutation<br/>\nConc/Disc/Heal/Perf/<br/>\n<br/>\nOther that that, pretty flexible on Dex vs Strength,  Weapon Focus, 3rd Class, Feats, ect.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for your help.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
