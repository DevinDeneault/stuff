DwD also has d12 hit die which is very nice. The Defensive stance is ok for the +4 dodge AC, the stats are also good early on but not so great later when stats can get capped.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, I've had a brief look at <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/request306326.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Thax's guide to Dwarven Defenders</a> again and I've found some things I'm still not doing optimally so I might have to make some modifications to the build which I'll look into when I have some time! For example I don't think epic warding and the damage reduction stacks so I might as well ditch EW to see if I can get that DR to around 20 +<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Edit:</strong><br/>\nRedid the build, dropped EW and added EDR x3 at the cost of 2AB (which may or may not matter). Put in some set trap skills from removing some points from spellcraft now EW is not needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas DR 21/- now which should tank a very large proportion of any enemy's physical melee attack, particularly now that they can't critically hit you.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAC can get to 10 +8 (dex) +4 (tumble) +2 (AS) +10 (PM16) +20 (EMA) +4 (defensive stance) without items = 58 AC. Add +5 robes, +5 tower and capped dexterity (+6) its 74 AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nMagical/elemental damage is still a problem, death immunity will need to be cast from party members or by equipping that belt of guiding light<br/>\n<br/>\nA bard PM DD would have a much better AB but there are alignment issues there<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Wizard(6), Dwarven Defender(18), Pale Master(16), Dwarf\nSTR: 8\nCON: 18 (21)\nINT: 16 (17)\n\n01: Wizard(1): Toughness, {Scribe Scroll}\n03: Wizard(3): Weapon Finesse\n05: Pale Master(2)\n07: Pale Master(4)\n09: Pale Master(6): Knockdown\n11: Pale Master(8)\n13: Pale Master(10)\n15: Dwarven Defender(1): Weapon Focus: Rapier, {Defensive Stance}\n17: Dwarven Defender(3)\n19: Dwarven Defender(5)\n21: Wizard(5): Epic Damage Reduction I, Great Intelligence I, (INT=17)\n23: Dwarven Defender(8)\n25: Dwarven Defender(10)\n27: Dwarven Defender(12): Epic Damage Reduction III\n29: Dwarven Defender(14): Epic Weapon Focus: Rapier\n31: Pale Master(11)\n33: Pale Master(13): Great Dexterity I, Epic Energy Resistance: Acid I, (DEX=22)\n35: Pale Master(15)\n37: Wizard(6)\n39: Dwarven Defender(17): Great Dexterity III, (DEX=25)\n\nSkillpoints: 215\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8, Traps: +1, Poison: +2\nAB (max, naked): 35 (melee), 32 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Wizard(7)\n\n\n01: Concentration(4), Disable Trap(1), Open Lock(1), Search(2), Set Trap(2), Spellcraft(2), Save(2),\u00a0\n03: Concentration(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Save(6),\u00a0\n05: Listen(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Save(6),\u00a0\n07: Listen(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n09: Concentration(1), Listen(1), Set Trap(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n11: Concentration(1), Listen(1), Set Trap(1), Save(8),\u00a0\n13: Concentration(1), Listen(1), Save(14),\u00a0\n15: Discipline(18), Listen(2), Save(4),\u00a0\n17: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n19: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n21: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(10),\u00a0\n23: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(2),\u00a0\n25: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(6),\u00a0\n27: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n29: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n31: Listen(1), Spellcraft(9), Save(2),\u00a0\n33: Concentration(5),\u00a0\n35: Concentration(1), Save(8),\u00a0\n37: Concentration(1), Tumble(5), Save(6),\u00a0\n39: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(3),\u00a0</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
