      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Fighter 6/ Bard 16/ Dwarven Defender 18 for the most amount of damage reduction, plus a strong Bard song. You take four levels of Fighter pre-epic and just two more in epic for the EWS.<br/>\n<br/>\n You start/ finish with something like that for ability scores,\u00a0 STR 16 (<strong>26</strong>)\u00a0 DEX 13\u00a0 CON 18 (<strong>22</strong>)\u00a0 INT 13\u00a0 WIS 08\u00a0 CHA 06<br/>\n<br/>\n You won't have the ability to cast any Bard spells but you can use whatever arcane scrolls/ wands you liike for buffing because you are an arcane caster already and the most important thing is your Bard/ Curse song anyway. This build will get you EDR III as well offering 21/ -- Damage Reduction plus the usual Defensive Awareness, Dodge, Uncunny Dodge and Defensive Stance. Stance/ Song/ Curse and Dodge alone will give you something like<strong> +12 armour class over and above, </strong>what a normal full tumble warrior already has and with the amount of HP's you will have plus Defensive Awareness plus 21 points of Damage Reduction will make you a <strong>very hard nut </strong>to crack. AB will be relatively low (40) unbuffed but with Bard Song/ Curse Song it essentially is +7 from what shown on paper.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
