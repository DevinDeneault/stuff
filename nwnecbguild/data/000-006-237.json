This Bard-at-arms is a melee warrior, a \u201cCrit Crazy\u201d WM in fact with not just one but two weapon specializations, thus preferring not the Pen (Song) but the Sword. To see the original, with links therein to other characters in the \u201cFighting Bard\u201d Series along with other build combos utilizing the FTR/WM/Bard Class in the ECB1 at the time of original posting, see: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build250991.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 50991.html</a> </div></blockquote>\n<strong>Pros and Cons:</strong><br/>\nThe Medieval Mercenary enjoys a double weapon mastery, enabling among other things the delivery of different damage types, with high/PG AB 52+1 Song: 53 (78 AB Bio-Cap) to deliver what is nothing short of exceptional damage output -- slicing through enemies like there\u2019s no tomorrow. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to achieve \u201cCombat/Level 40 Excellence\u201d some things had to be sacrificed, but defense wasn\u2019t one of them\u2014i.e., has a nice enough AC for a melee warrior (with Expertise for more), bolstered by IKD, and over 450HPs, such that defense is rather solid. Skills on the other hand are rather thin (but has what s/he really needs), and while saves could be better, has more than enough strength for carting i.e. clarity potions (typical melee!).

That said, weapons are a matter of personal choice and if looking for a \u201cperiod correct\u201d (Medieval Knight) weapon, might I recommend a polearm? The closest in NWN being the Halberd, with damage stats set out in Combat section, below. <br/>\n<blockquote><div>\nALTERNATE OPTIONS:<br/>\n<strong>Want a more skilled Blade? (PvP Optimization recommendation Included): </strong><br/>\nAdjustments: STR: 17 (32), DEX: 13, CON: 14, WIS: 8, INT: 14, CHA: 8<br/>\n+1 Fort, +40HPs (496HPs) and +43 Skills [217 points, full-train Taunt (+6 AB) or Spellcraft (Bonus, +9 saves v. spells)], picking up Epic Fort (another +4 Fort, or 26 adj (35 v spells) or Armor Skin (+2 AC) in epic as opposed to what would be an extraneous STR. If looking to PvP your Mercenary, then consider the above stat adj. (picking up Epic Fort), and also swapping PA, IKD, WS/EWS Heavy Flail to pick up grt.fort (28 adj/37 v spells), disarm/impr.disarm, and ESF: Disc. (+10 Disc., or impr.unarmed strike) for PvP as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\n06: Fighter(6): Weapon Focus: Heavy Flail, spring attack<br/>\n08: Fighter(8): STR+1, improved critical: scimitar, (STR=19)<br/>\n12: Weapon Master(2): STR+1, improved critical: heavy flail, (STR=20)<br/>\n15: Weapon Master(5): great fort (or, improved knockdown)<br/>\n18: Fighter(11): disarm<br/>\n19: Fighter(12): improved disarm<br/>\n21: Weapon Master(8): Epic Fortitude<br/>\n33: Fighter(14): Epic Skill Focus: Discipline, epic weapon specialization: scimitar<br/>\n<br/>\nCost -2 STR (-1AB/damage, for an all-natural high/PG AB 52 (51+1 Song adj) still, and loss of WS/EWS on your Heavy Flail which WS/EWS on your secondary weapon along with IKD is quite enjoyable PvM/E, but not so much PvP where you\u2019ll enjoy that boost to Fort, Disc. and disarm ability instead. [Note: skill check v opponent\u2019s AB/attack to resist KD/IKD, Called Shots and Disarm, meantime reaching out with your large weapon (size boni, which also enhances your AB/attack roll, too) to disarm your foes instead, while enjoying all that 1.5x STR boni on your 2-hander, with WS/EWS also and still on your crit.charged scimmy, too; heh, best defense is a strong offense always (Enjoy!)].<br/>\n<br/>\n*<strong>Prefer Early UMD/Magic Access\u2014i.e. Versatility (PvM/E)? Alright. Here you go:</strong> <br/>\nDrop 3 WM for 2 more FTR and 1 more Bard (i.e., FTR 16, Bard 2, WM 22). Run pre-ep as is, taking your first Bard at Lvl 23 (for a skills dump), other Bard at 40 as is. From Lvl. 24 on, run with WM (i.e., WM 10-21, and feats accordingly), grabbing your FTR 14 at Lvl. 36 (for EWS Scimitar/EWS Heavy Flail) followed by WM 22 at Lvl. 37 (epic prowess in turn), with 2 more FTRs thereafter (selecting Epic Toughess as a FTR bonus feat) and finish thus with your 2nd Bard [skills dump, with final distribution as follows: Disc 43(55), Intim 4(3), Listen 42(41), Perf 7(6), Tumble 40(41), UMD 36(35)]. Cost: -1 AB/damage, -4HPs, but +2skills and early magic access/added versatility. Your choice, your Medieval Mercenary, Double Weapon Master.
