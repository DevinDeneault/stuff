Doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t make the others work. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs an aside, EBT doesn\u2019t use your foci, it\u2019s a grapple check that bypasses SR. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you are arcane and it comes down to either/or between evo and conjo at level 23, maybe there\u2019s a third option you\u2019ve overlooked. </div>"

I edited my first post to make it less confusing. So I think Evocation is the school more reliant on saves. Also yes, I have chosen Necromancy as the primary option.</em></div>"
