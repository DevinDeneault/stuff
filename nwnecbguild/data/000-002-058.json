As far as i understand mechanics of game, best 1h weapon will be battleaxe, if I'm encounter enemy with relatively high DC, (for example 70% chance to hit with 1st attack in row), and\u00a0relatively high DR, compare to scimitar (with equal feats and\u00a0additional damage of other types on weapon)?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Well, actually, for any weapon that does a straight amount of damage (no conglomeration) like this (1-6), the chance is equal for 1,2,3,4,5 or 6.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere really is no \"higher chance\" for a 3 or 4 here.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere that starts to come into play is 2-8 (2d4), 2-12 (2d6), etc.\u00a0 Then the chances that the middle numbers come up increases.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo no, the Battleaxe is not the best 1-h weapon in the game.\u00a0 It also does 1d8, not 1d6.\u00a0 Maybe you mean the handaxe??<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, to compare weapons like this, you also need to factor in the crit range and bonus imo.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf what you mean here is Battleaxe vs Scimitar, and you are only talking base damage, then yes, Battleaxe&gt;Scimitar (1d8 &gt; 1d6).\u00a0 <br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise, a Bastard Sword/Katana does 1d10&gt;1d8 of the Battleaxe.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That average damage per attack I'm compare with Scimitar (with same bonuses and feats)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as I'm understand, scimitar is superior, than i can easly hit target within its threat range. If target harder to hit, than crit multiplier is more valuable. And if i had 4 attacks per round, and 1-st has around 70% chance to hit target, than 2,3,4 attacks have even less chance to hit target. <br/>\n\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Undeads and constructs a pretty common in OC, if i remember correctly.\u00a0 There are many great builds on this forum and on the internet,\u00a0 many of that builds suggest to take scimitar as good 1-h weapon. Trying to figure out game mechanics, and enjoy theorycraft something by myself. <br/>\n<br/>\np.s. I'm sorry if the reasoning sounded too confident,\u00a0 I don't pretend to be \"the builder of year\" or something like that.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
