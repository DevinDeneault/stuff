There is both a vanilla version and a BSK-specific version of the script for people who want a tool that can help with min-maxing builds. The download includes a basic explanation of the script and examples of how to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/other/tool/average-damage-round-calculator-adprcalc\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://neverwintervault.org/project/nw ... r-adprcalc</a><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

How time flies, lol<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently wrote out a 'weapon damage comparison' google sheet for A Dawn of Heroes, but it uses average damage values and doesn't take AB/AC calculations into account. This would be waaaaaay more thorough than the thing that I put together.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for releasing it to the public! :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
