I am in the starting city, Heliopolis, and I have done everything I can find to do, except stopping that \"heretic\" on the roof, whom I cannot stop without murdering him. I need the captain of the guard to ask me to investigate the desert folk, and I can't seem to trigger that. I have played this before, but it was years ago, and I don't remember how I got it to work before. I have rescued the miners, cleared out the remains of the snake cult under the old tower and returned the seargent's amulet, cleared out the couple's basement that was connected to the snake cult ruins, found the lost boy in the dragon's cave and talked to his mother and the captain about him, found the missing oxen and reported it to the herder and head priest, and found several herbs for the potion maker. What am I missing?</div>",

      "content": "<div>As a word of advice, this is a character building guild, not really a module strategy forum.  I noticed you posted this in the bioware social forums as well.  You are probably better off waiting to get a reply there.  However, the .zip that you downloaded in order to get the Sands of Fate module included a walkthrough.  I would check that first to see if perhaps it can help you. I have never played that module, so that is as far as I can go in order to help.  If, for some reason, you no longer have the walkthrough and don't know where to find the .zip.. here's a <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Modules.Detail&amp;id=3940&amp;comment_page=1\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">link</a>.</div>"
