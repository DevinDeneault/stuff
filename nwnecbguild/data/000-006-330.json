Self Concealment has been given up but that is not to be a big concern in environments where Improved Invisibility is easily available, especially if in (rechargeable) wand format which will grant a near endless and easily recastable supply of 50% concealment.

I think the lower HP and the diminished ability to pierce concealment are outweighed by the capacity to generate Sneaks and to neutralize casters, but I understand your choices, I guess. I'd also go for EMA before EW, just because with the very high AC you should have, EMA will function in all encounters (16 hours) and make it so that you just won't get hit except on 20s, whereas EW only lasts for 16 rounds, even if it gives you a much better property. Scrolls of Premonition will have to do till then <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, congrats, indeed there are not enough skill points to a guy like this.</div>"

Besides, Epic Warding is sort of more useful for mobs than players, because mobs fight once every so often (when someone comes to them), while players are always looking for trouble, making its usage somewhat limited in the sense that you'll have multiple encounters between rests so you'll have to choose one to use it in and that's it. And Premonition, which grants 30/+5 DR but lasts an hour per level, can be used by this toon through scrolls.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Question for you Kail.  You have really high trap skills but a really low search skill.  Is there a specific reason for this?  I know this build is skill starved, but it seems kinda weird to have really high disable trap without being able to actually find those traps to disable with the low search.  Is 5 (modified) search enough to find the traps you want to disable?</div>"

      "content": "<div>You need 23 modified ranks to spot on a 20 a standard epic trap (walk slowly and stop very often where you expect traps). With 5 modified ranks you can spot all traps but epic ones with a more or less lucky roll (depending on the trap, of course) since the highest DC is 22. Getting gear that enhances search is not so unusual, but you may consider also to divert points from Taunt or also Perform, given the weak song. Spellcraft can be dropped to 34 ranks if EW is kept but can be lowered up to 26 ranks if one goes for Mummy Dust/Dragon Knigh/Greater Ruin instead of EW or to 32 ranks if Hellball is taken instead.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Correct me if I'm wrong, but you only need 1 rank in disable traps to recover your own epic traps.  You have 48 modified ranks in Disable trap, which only makes sense if you want to recover enemy epic traps.  However, with 5 modified ranks into search, you will never be able to detect those Epic traps.  I know you just replied with alternatives to boost search skill, but it seems like it's not really an alternative but mandatory as built.  You either pump up search to 23 modified ranks or you scale back on disable traps skill a few ranks.  Unless you are depending on +search equipment to get you the remaining +17 skill?<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, I know this is nitpicking. The build looks very solid, if not spectacular, otherwise.  I know I'd want builds I presented to be nitpicked.  I'm just trying to understand the seeming contradiction in your skill point allotment.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Aye, Int and search enhancement is necessary to get to 23+ search score. Watchman's Helm is +8 search, Greater Robe of Eyes is +10 search. Int enhancing gear like rings and amulets or even potions also contribute to the final score. That +17 score is not that unreachable and even less so with a bard in the party.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, it's true that as is it is kind of not consistent so the skillpoints distribution can be changed to:<br/>\n<br/>\nDisable Trap 34(48), Hide 39(50), Move Silently 37(50), Open Lock 1(12), Perform 10(9), Search 21(23), Set Trap 31(44), Spellcraft 34(36), Taunt 36(35), Tumble 40(51), UMD 31(30)<br/>\n<br/>\nSet trap is 1 point below the mark, but one will surely benefit from at least a +2 Dex enhancement by the time one can set epic traps, so no harm done there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for pointing out the issue</div>"
