      "content": "<div>Get ready because the next few days you will witness some truly unique builds, and the first one is noone else than \"<strong>The Dark Assailant</strong>\", a build that i constructed in order to combine some of the best features of DEX-based builds on a full STR-based character. Moreover i gave it the potential of one-shot-kills by adding to the mix the brutal efficiency of a Weapon's master critical hits. What we have here is a character that appears out of nowhere, makes a flurry of hits to their opponents and they simply crumble under the weight of that immense damage, while he is back at shadows before everyone's eyes. Now this has been done already by Mith's \"<strong>Silent Knight</strong>\", the only build i could find that matched my criteria but with a major difference, with only three lvls of Shadowdancer he doesn't take some of the most juicy class features, like <strong>Improved evasion</strong> or <strong>Shadow evade</strong> or <strong>Slippery mind</strong>.<br/>\n<br/>\nMith's Silent Knight =&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build240420.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 40420.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNow, you most likely noticed how i mentioned in particular the \"<strong>Shadow Evade</strong>\", an ability that Shadowdancers can operate 3/ Day and provides them with some damage mitigation and most importantly +4 AC for a duration of five Rounds. And i am aware that in most PW's this ability has been expanded to at least 1 Round/ SD lvl. This could mean that \"<strong>Shadow Evade</strong>\" can now constribute to the defenses of a character significantly so, making characters that use Big Weapons have a good AC also. In this particular build we will have a \"<strong>Shadow Evade</strong>\" that lasts for at least 16 Rounds each time (a whole fight). In addition the \"<strong>Dark Assasilant</strong>\", despite the plethora of Shadowdancer lvls has a very good AB, allowing him to take full advantage of his Expertise feat and adding more AC when he needs it. And with that AB, attacking flat-footed foes with Improved Knockdown and with all that Strength boosted by a Big Axe &amp; Weapon's master advanced training, you can guess the most likely outcome, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, we all know that these kind of builds always have bad saving throws &amp; hit points alike, based more on their active defenses to survive (and they do have lot's of them) but this particular Dwarf, will respectfully disagree on the matter having over half a thousand hit points and some boosted from both Spellcraft &amp; Dwarven Hardiness saves, along with slippery mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n* I choose a <strong>Greataxe </strong>as my weapon of choice, which is a weapon that most benefit from Weapon' masters augmented criticals and a fit weapon for a natural 34 STR character, but you can always change to Battleaxe &amp; large Shield for even more AC if that is what you prefer. The stealth penalty you get from them is completely mitigated from the ESF's in both Hide &amp; Move Silently.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;line-height:normal\"><strong>THE DARK ASSAILANT</strong></span><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>(FTR 16/ SD 16/ WM 8)</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n RACE: Dwarf<br/>\n<br/>\n ALIGNMENT: TN (Smite proof)<br/>\n<br/>\n PLAYABILITY: PvM 1 \u2013 40<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>STARTING/ ENDING STATS</strong>:<br/>\n STR  - 17 (<strong>34</strong>)<br/>\n DEX - 13<br/>\n CON - 16<br/>\n INT   - 14<br/>\n WIS  - 08<br/>\n CHA - 06<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Hit Points: 528</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Skill Points: 236</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n Discipline: 43 (55)<br/>\n Hide: 42 (53) \u2192 {first 10 cc}<br/>\n Move Silently: 42 (53) \u2192 {first 8 cc}<br/>\n Intimidate: 4 (3) cc<br/>\n Spellcraft: 18 (20) cc<br/>\n Heal: 7 (6)<br/>\n Tumble: 40 (41)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fort/Ref/Will): 22/ 23/ 15 \u2192 28/ 29/ 21  (saves Vs spells) &amp; (Imp.Evasion \u2013 Slip.Mind)<br/>\n<br/>\n Naked/ Armoured AC: 21/ 29/ 34  (Full plate) \u2192 (Expertise mode)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong> AC in plain Full plate with Shadow evade &amp; Expertise: 38</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n BAB: 29  (Four attacks)<br/>\n<br/>\n AB: +46/ +41/ +36/ +31  (Greataxe)<br/>\n<br/>\n DMG: 1D12 +24 / 17-20 X4  (Greataxe)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>HiPS!</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Shadow Evade</strong> 3/ Day:  +4 AC for 5 Rounds  (minimum)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Shadow Daze</strong>: 1/ Day DC:  27 (33)<br/>\n<br/>\n Improved Evasion/ Slippery Mind/ Defensive Roll/ Uncanny Dodge<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>LEVELING GUIDE</strong>:<br/>\n<br/>\n01) Fighter (01): Dodge, Expertise<br/>\n02) Fighter (02): WF: Greataxe<br/>\n03) Fighter (03): Mobility<br/>\n04) Fighter (04): WS: Greataxe<br/>\n05) Fighter (05):  <br/>\n06) Fighter (06): Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack<br/>\n07) WM (01): <br/>\n08) WM (02): <br/>\n09) WM (03): Blind Fight<br/>\n10) WM (04): <br/>\n11) WM (05): <br/>\n12) WM (06): Knockdown<br/>\n13) WM (07): <br/>\n14) WM (08): <br/>\n15) Fighter (07): IC: Greataxe<br/>\n16) Fighter (08): Improved Knockdown<br/>\n17) Fighter (09): <br/>\n18) SD (01): Toughness<br/>\n19) SD (02): <br/>\n20) SD (03): <br/>\n21) Fighter (10): Great STR I, EWF: Greataxe<br/>\n22) SD (04): <br/>\n23) Fighter (11): <br/>\n24) Fighter (12): Great STR II, EWS: Greataxe<br/>\n25) Fighter (13):<br/>\n26) Fighter (14): Armour Skin<br/>\n27) SD (05): Great STR III<br/>\n28) SD (06): <br/>\n29) SD (07): <br/>\n30) SD (08): Great STR IV<br/>\n31) SD (09): <br/>\n32) SD (10): <br/>\n33) SD (11): Great STR V<br/>\n34) SD (12): <br/>\n35) SD (13): ESF: Hide<br/>\n36) Fighter (15): Great STR VI<br/>\n37) SD (14): <br/>\n38) SD (15): <br/>\n39) SD (16): Great STR VII, ESF: Move Silently<br/>\n40) Fighter (16): Epic Prowess<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>SPECIAL NOTES</strong>: <br/>\n<br/>\n+4 AC Vs Giants (Racial)<br/>\n<br/>\n+1 AB Vs Orcs &amp; Goblinoids  (Racial)<br/>\n<br/>\n+2 to Saves Vs Poison  (Racial)<br/>\n<br/>\n   Darkvision  (Class)</div>"
