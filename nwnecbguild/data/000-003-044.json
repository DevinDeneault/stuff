Prefer Human, or Elf/Half Elf for the race. For weapons, any one handed weapon with a Tower Shield [Prefer Longsword].<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease post the build format, and make it easy to understand, and idiotproof. I have no idea how buffer builds work.</div>"

Good to have you here.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlas, your request is way out of my particular comfort zone, but while you're waiting for someone better to come along, have you had a look at Mick Dagger's Guide to Bards in the Game Guides sub-forum? It might help with your thoughts on buffing...<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!</div>",
