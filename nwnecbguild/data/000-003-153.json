      "content": "<div>For the Shaolin, I think a DEX-based Rogue / Monk / Fighter dual-wielding kamas would be best. I made one years ago that balances the Monk and Fighter levels to avoid EXP penalty, but it needs tweaking with what I have learned since then.<br/>\n<br/>\n For the Battlerager, I am picturing a STR-based Fighter / Bard / RDD that can switch back and forth between dual-wielding a dwarven waraxe and a kukri and using a dwarvern waraxe and a shield. I recently made a silimar build that would need to be modified for this. Or, a Barbarian / Fighter ( / WM?) taking advantage of that Intimidate bonus for his Terrifying Rage.<br/>\n<br/>\n For the Swashbuckler, I like the idea of a DEX-based Rogue / Fighter / WM either using rapier and shield or rapier and short sword.<br/>\n<br/>\n For the Kender, a stealthy DEX-based Rogue / Fighter / CoT would do well.</div>",

But the problem will be identical in both cases... you'll need a lot of CHA to make the commitment to either DivGrace or DarkBlessg pay off.\u00a0 Else, just way too feat-starved either combo over fighter. PA/DivMight would be nice for a Dexer to draw upon as well but where to shove it in?\u00a0 Tight fit if even possible with all the subrace shenanigans.<br/>\n<br/>\n Is this a server where you need to take a minimum number of each class before switching?</div></div>"
