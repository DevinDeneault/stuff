      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The Avatar of Thor, or Torm as some of the modern misguided infidels call him, is the Incarnation of the God of Thunder himself.<br/>\n Commanding the Asgardian army against the vile King of Frost Jotuns during the peak of the fimbulvintr, the Avatar stands as an unmovable beacon of unfailing determination amidst the Aesirs.<br/>\n<br/>\n Not even the Ancient White Dragon King's aura of terror and despair effects him. The Great Frozen Lich Lord, Iceheart the Black, points his finger towards the Avatar and an arrow of frozen death slams into his chest and engulfs his body. The Lich cackles ominously, but as the cloud of pitch black iceflakes slowly dissipates, the Mighty Man-Turned God shows no sign of injury.<br/>\n He throws his hammer, Mjolnir. It slams into the skull of Iceheart, exploding it like a melon.<br/>\n<br/>\n As the battle rages on, the Avatar just stands at the foot of Bifrost Bridge, his stern glare locked onto his biggest adversary, the very reason his God lent him his divine power, the King of Frost Jotuns himself.<br/>\n<br/>\n Finally the King himself enters the fray, swatting Aesirs aside like they were flies circling a cow's tail. With large thunderous strides he closes in on this glaring mortal standing at the foot of the bridge he has been craving to cross for so many eons.<br/>\n<br/>\n The two titans exchange blows for minutes without slowing down, the snow on the ground swirling around and covering the combatants in an icy mist.<br/>\n Finally! Thunders the Jotun King as he thrusts his greatsword, Icingdeath, through the chest of the Avatar freezing his very lifeblood, its tip sticking out the back dripping with gangrenous ooze from the evil magics cast upon the frozen blade.<br/>\n<br/>\n The Jotun King, thinking the battle won triumphantly roars at the broken body at his feet.<br/>\n All hope is lost?<br/>\n<br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\n<br/>\n The Avatar clenches his fist and holds it againt the wound in his chest... A divine light illuminates the dark misty battleground and his wound closes, leaving no trace of the grievous wound.<br/>\n<br/>\n Dumbfounded by the impossible feat he has just witnessed, the Jotun King takes a step back from the man before him.<br/>\n The avatar slowly stands up, his hand now grasping Mjolnir so tight his knuckles turn whiter than the first morningsnow.<br/>\n He calls out to his God to grant him the Might of Thor, raises Mjolnir with both hands above his head and brings it back down with all his might.<br/>\n<br/>\n As the hammer hits the chest of the Jotun King, the sky opens up and an enormous crack of thunder, caused by the lightning bolt bolstering the impact of Mjolnir, sends shockwaves across the battlefield so forcefull it knocks Jotuns and Aesir's alike off their feet and deafening the weak. The very earth raises up in a circular pattern around the combatants.<br/>\n<br/>\n Standing in the middle of the newly created crater is a lone man grasping a hammer crackling with divine lightning.... No evidence of the Jotun King remains, except for the bardic tales spreading from tavern to tavern. The Avatar has not been seen since that night.... Until now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#000000\">Pros: Godlike (obviously) saves, Laughs at Dev.

The saves ended close at: 50/34/35 (not sure where I lost that reflex, though, so somebody shed some light please?)<br/>\n<br/>\n Skills all the same with one adjustment.\u00a0 Take all 21 points in Spellcraft yielding a modified 23.\u00a0 Half of the times you pre-buff with a Fox pot prior to combat or doing recon, you will reach another +1 saves vs. spells.\u00a0 It's a triviality but why just throw it away, eh?<br/>\n<br/>\n This is a great toon to taunt with! <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /></div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">A champion of Thor wielding a lethal hammer! I like the concept. I like the story!<br/>\n<br/>\n The saving throw boni are impressive when you combine a level 28 Sacred defence with Divine grace and some charisma, Spellcraft and Luck of heroes! Divine wrath caps the saves.<br/>\n The AB is not a \"con\". +44 is quite adequate for a Warrior. Divine wrath works like a strong turbo engine when you need an extra boost. And Taunt will always be available.<br/>\n Divine might adds divine, and in most cases irresistable damage. +10 x 10 rounds when capped with gear. In that way you can \"touch\" mages, even with Epic warding up. <br/>\n IKD and DM together make a strong weapon against mages.<br/>\n You list AC under \"cons\". I like to see the naked AC in the 30's, but then you will need a tumble class or RDD/ PM. Dex gear or a cat's pot can add +2. Divine Shield adds Dodge armor, and you have Expertise to help you out. Armor skin might be worth it, but you are feat starved.<br/>\n Warhammer is a grat all-round weapon. Few resist blunt force. The threat range is short, and that is not optimal in a Dev crit build. But I understand why you have picked hammer in this case.<br/>\n<br/>\n All in all, an interesting and strong build. I like it!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

But the theme kind of pigeonholes it into hammer. Its ok though, i like a good warhammer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n If i'm right, doing 8F 6P, compared to this one (changing Great Fort to Armor Skin) would net me -1 base saves, +4 fort and same AC, so a net gain of 3 fort and a loss of 1 will/ref and i would not be able to dump taunt during epic progression which would lower the playability some i think.<br/>\n<br/>\n To me i'm not sure the trade is worth it when you already have 47 fort.<br/>\n<br/>\n Although, 8F 6P could give \u00a0-1 fort/ref \u00a0for +3 will if i take Epic Will over Great Fort. And still get armor skin, that might be tempting ending at 46/35/35.<br/>\n<br/>\n Dev Crit levels is a matter of preferance i guess, same with the earlier con, i prefered the +1 con bonus early for slightly better ac and duration during the mid epic levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n I never liked dev crit very much, but wielding mjolnir and not being able to pulverize something in one hit seemed wrong.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
