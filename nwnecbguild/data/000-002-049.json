Do you guys think it would be the same if a PC had an active aura they can turn on ? <br/>\n<br/>\n\"Thanks for the tips on attacking. I think I maybe figured out why it was not working on any of the unique mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n The auras that they have are attack auras (such as cold dmg, etc.), and they turn\u00a0 on combat the moment I step within the aura. So due to this I lose the status I need to be in to qualify for paralysis attempt. Maybe?\"\u00a0 From the kama-shinobi-monk-9-assassin-26-sd-5 build page 7<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

In the meantime, I'll just ask, what sort of PC aura do you mean? And if an assassin sneaks up on the PC without their knowledge how can they turn on the aura in time to prevent the DA?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Every time the aura damages somebody it will count as combat, so you will remain in combat for as long as someone is inside the aura. In that case it will prevent you from getting paralyzed by Death Attack unless the assassin uses a ranged attack to stay outside of the aura.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther auras/AoEs such as Battletide or Darkness only trigger when you enter the aura/AoE. In that case you'll be in combat for the first round or two after an enemy enters the aura/AoE but after a couple of rounds you'll leave combat provided that nothing else enters the aura/AoE. This means you won't be safe from getting paralyzed by a Death Attack, but it also means that if you're an assassin you can paralyze something that entered and left combat by simply waiting.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you worried about PvP then an aura won't really help though. A smart assassin can either use a ranged weapon to attack you from outside of the aura or enter the aura and then wait until you're out of combat before attacking. The safest way to avoid Death Attack paralysis (other than immunity) is to constantly attack a placeable such as a door in order to stay in combat.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
