      "content": "<div>Well, TBH, OrangeAGENT, Sands of Fate is one of the few level 40 modules that start with you at around level 27/8 (actually, it's the only one I can think of). Don't get me wrong, it's a perfectly fine and shiny thing, but for me, Aielund still rules (and you can certainly get to level 37 there: Mick's managed level 38 a time or two). Swordflight is tough, and I haven't engaged with it as fully as I'd like, but it's still a work in progress - currently at low-mid 30s, I believe - designed to end up at level 40 by its final installment. Mines of Twin Summit is a hack'n'slash blast, with very high magic. If you start that at around level 17 (pretty much when you finish the OC), you should manage level 40 not long after beginning its third part.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",
