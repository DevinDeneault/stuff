A good fortitude save is a start, but those casters have some nasty defences they can throw up, and it won't work as a first (ie most likely to hit) attack on a build with ED - and that's leaving aside crit-immune types. The list goes on...<br/>\n<br/>\nSpell-chuckers: whingers, the lot of 'em. <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's the essence of my argument, Shia.

Here is a brief discussion and some tips.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of this is simply my opinion and can be subject to further debate in the thread.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Pre-requisites</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nStrength 25+<br/>\nPower Attack<br/>\nCleave<br/>\nGreat Cleave<br/>\nImproved Critical [both melee and ranged weapons]<br/>\nOverwhelming Critical<br/>\n<br/>\nA level of monk will save only one feat (cleave) as power attack is required to be taken to obtain great cleave.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Recommended</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nBase AB 40+ (at level 40)<br/>\nWeapon with 18-20 or 19-20 threat range\u00a0<br/>\n- 15-20 / 17-20 with improved critical, 12-20 / 15-20 with keen<br/>\n<br/>\nBase Strength 28+ (for base Str 40 when capped) -&gt; Fort save 39-45 or die at level 40<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Likely base fortitude saves of opponents at level 40</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nHigh save: 22 + cons modifier + save feats<br/>\nLow save 12 + cons modifier + save feats<br/>\n<br/>\n(pre-epic multiclassing ie Fighter/Cleric can modify this slightly, also module designers/DMs can modify this as well)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Mechanics</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nAny opponent who receives a critical hit must make a fortitude save or die.<br/>\nThe DC is 10 + 1/2 attacker character level + strength modifier.<br/>\nAn opponent rolling a 1 will fail the fortitude save roll and die.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Landing critical hits</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nThe attack roll firstly needs to land in the threat range.<br/>\nThe attack must hit.\u00a0<br/>\nConcealment (ie 50% from improved invisibility) must be beaten.\u00a0<br/>\nThe attack roll has to either be a 20, or the attack roll plus the attack bonus plus modifiers (ie +2 AB from flanking) beating the opponents AC.<br/>\nA threat roll will then occur. The threat roll plus AB plus modifiers must beat the opponents AC. Rolling a 20 with a threat roll will not lead to a critical hit, if the AC is not beaten.<br/>\nThe opponent must be susceptible to critical hits.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">The main problem with enabling Dev Crit is that the entire server/environment needs to be balanced around it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor PvM, any major mobs will need either high fortitude saves (making DC casters less effective) or immunity to critical hits (which affects most non-casters). Higher AC isn't an effective counter for PvM since raising mob AC will negatively affect most non-casters. Even if mob saves are high enough to resist Dev Crit, unless the server has changed 1's to not cause auto-fails then eventually a Dev Crit will trigger and kill anything that isn't immune to critical hits. This means that for big bosses to actually be threatening the only choices are to remove auto-fails, make them all immune to critical hits, or edit/remove Dev Crit.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost PvP environments nerf Dev Crit but they usually nerf other OP feats and spells too. Altering or removing Dev Crit, Epic Warding, Greater Sanctuary, Harm/Heal, HiPS, IGMS, Time Stop, and True Seeing are usually among the first changes PvP servers make due to how unbalanced they are in vanilla NWN.<br/>\n<br/>\nA human Figh14/WM25/Bard1 dual-wielding kukris is a fairly simple build that shows how powerful Dev Crit can be. In addition to high AB, high damage, and UMD, with +12 STR it also has a 48 DC Dev Crit and a 13-20 threat range (10-20 with keened kukris). A maxed Implosion can be cast twice a round and has a 48 DC, the main difference being Spellcraft boosts saves against Implosion so Dev Crit is harder to resist.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a list of the average number of critical hits per round from the build for the important AC range.<br/>\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" data-s9e-mediaembed=\"imgur\" onload=\"var c=new MessageChannel;c.port1.onmessage=function(e){var d=e.data.split(' ');style.height=d[0]+'px';style.width=d[1]+'px'};contentWindow.postMessage('s9e:init','https://s9e.github.io',[c.port2])\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://s9e.github.io/iframe/2/imgur.min.html#ZZiI24T\" style=\"border:0;height:400px;max-width:100%;width:542px\"></iframe><br/>\nThe key is \"Ha_Ke\" = hasted + keened kukris, \"Ha_NK\" = hasted + non-keened kukris, \"NH_Ke\" = non-hasted + keened kukris, \"NH_NK\" = non-hasted + non-keened kukris.<br/>\nThis assumes +12 STR but only +0 weapons, if +X weapons are available in your environment then add X to the AC (eg. with +5 kukris the AC range is 46-85). Concealment and Epic Dodge aren't factored into this calculation, just AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen hasted and using keened kukris, against creatures with 42 AC or less the build does an average of 3.85 critical hits per round. This decreases to 2.0725 against creatures with 61 AC, which is slightly better than the 2 per round from Implosion. This also shows why increasing AC isn't a viable tactic to deal with Dev Crit in PvM. In order to reduce the average number of critical hits per round to less than 1 a creature needs an AC of 67 (72 in a +5 EB environment), which seriously restricts the number of viable PvM builds.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
