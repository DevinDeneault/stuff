      "content": "<div>As I was tweaking my 2WM (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/2-weapon-weapon-master-help-needed-t2355131.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2-weapon-weapon-master-help-needed-t2355131.html</a>), thank you for all the help with it!, I had a few thoughts that I'm not sure if they were a stroke of genius (probably not) or just plain stupid...\u00a0 Bear with me, because this is totally optimized for Blackstone and show my abysmal lack of knowledge of game mechanics, but...<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Blackstone Keep the following applies:<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>High-end bosses and mobs have too high AB/AC/damage for anyone to survive against them solo with an ordinary build. Either you use a tank+2dps, or 2 dps (and win the war off attrition) builds.</li>\n<li>AC is not as important as Damage reduction and/or immunities.</li>\n<li>If you have +6 vampiric on your weapons and many attacks per round, you can stay alive a bit. It's very easy to add +6 vampiric to a weapon.</li>\n<li>Many high-end bosses and creatures are immune to crits.</li>\n<li>Nobody is immune to Divine Damage or Magical Damage (well, almost noone).</li>\n<li>You can easily add +d6 divine damage to (almost) any melee weapon.</li>\n<li>You can with some luck with the RNG gods add HA to any melee weapon.</li>\n<li>You can easily add +20 AB or +10 EB to (almost) any melee weapon.</li>\n<li>You can easily add 2d4 to 2d12 elemental/physical damage up to three times to any melee weapon. (It's random distribution of both rolls and damage type, so you might get anything, really.)</li>\n<li>Level 40 is the limit, though.</li>\n<li>There are two weapons in game that give you magical damage. One Battleaxe and one Dwarven Waraxe. (You can also get it from an Elf Blade, but that requires a special subrace which have other disadvantages.)</li>\n<li>You can easily equip your character with every possible wand that can be created by another character.</li>\n<li>You can easily equip your character with various items that give +6 AC and +4 STR and other abilities. Maxing out two abilities is somewhat easy, but three is hard. (It requires that you find stuff like +5CHA cloak, +6STR gloves, +5STR belt and +7CON boots.)</li>\n<li>You can equip your character with an armor with 25% immunity (and shield/helm with 5%). Theoretically, you can make two sets of armor+shield+helm and get 35% against piercing on one set and slashing on the other. (Don't think you need bludgeoning, really.)</li>\n</ul>\n\nNow, considering all that:<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes it make sense to ignore DevCrit/WeaponMaster and instead go for High-Charisma Axe-weilding Paladin/Barbarian or Paladin/Dwarven Defender, add divine and vampiric to weapons and go for 2-weapon fighting? (Or possibly Ranger levels to save on feats?) You want one or two Rogue/Bard levels for UMD, so you can use Wands, or you can throw in some druid/wizard which lets you use some more of the wands. (As a Paladin, you can use Cleric Wands if I remember correctly.)<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladin/Bard/DD, Cleric/Rogue/DD, Barbarian/Paladin/Rogue? Huh? Or do I go Cleric/Monk with divine Kamas for max attacks and max vampiric regen?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there (of course there is, I just need to find it) such a build available somewhere? Or do we need to invent it?<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people use DD to build tanks and WM for dps builds, but I'm still trying to figure out a build that can be OK as both. (Yes, I'm obsessed with soloing the high-level areas on Blackstone. Everyone needs a hobby...) So, before I start playing my 2WM, I wanted to run this idea by you guys. You've been patient with my weird builds and generous with your thoughts before, so once again I turn to you. With the above mention facts, what would be a nice build?</div>"

Hm. Is that a known build, or do I need to invent it? (Also, I'm allergic to dwarves, so I hope to come up with something that's not dwarven, but I guess I'll end up with a dwarf at the end...)<br/>\nAs for alignment, yes, Bards and Paladins don't mix, but Cleric/Paladin or Sorc/Paladin or Bard/Cleric or Barbarian/Cleric/CoT could work. In any case Good-Evil axis is easy to handle on BSK. Lawful/Chaotic not so much.</div>"
