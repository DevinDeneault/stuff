      "content": "<div>I had a rather interesting concept pop in my head. I was thinking a shady bard halfling that had a prime agenda of causing mayhem and trouble. Ideally the race would be Halfling, and would be of an evil alignment. As for classes, I was thinking along the lines of at the very least 16 bard levels. I would much rather be built for facing off other players than spawns.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome class combinations I had thought may be good for this concept; Rogue/Bard, Bard/Blackguard, Bard/Fighter,<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'm really looking for<br/>\n-Armor Class<br/>\n-PvP Survivability <br/>\n<br/>\nDamage on this build doesn't concern me too much. I'm mostly interested in AC and Saves. Decent AB would be under those two in my list. For feats, I was thinking something like..<br/>\n<br/>\nCurse Song<br/>\nExpertise<br/>\nWeapon Focus<br/>\nKnockdown<br/>\nBlind FIght<br/>\nImproved Critical<br/>\nImproved Expertise<br/>\nEpic Weapon Focus<br/>\nArmor Skin<br/>\nEpic Prowess<br/>\nLasting Inspiration (If I have the 20 levels. That's more of a cookie than a necessity)</div>"
