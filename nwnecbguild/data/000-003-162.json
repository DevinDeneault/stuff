Does that mean there is no favored class like a Human?<br/>\n<br/>\n With such STR and CON, this would make a great melee warrior type, with RDD or WM as the prestige class. With that DEX bonus, he could be a decent archer, but not as good as an Elf AA, and you would be wasting the potential form the STR and CON.</div>",

      "content": "<div>The answers you gave earlier imply that you want to make this an archer. This race would be an only slightly better archer than a regular Halfling. The only improvements would be that he would be better able to take advantage of a mighty bow and he would have more health. That is not much to gain to compensate for the massive ECL 3 penalty.<br/>\n On the other hand, this race would excel as a melee warrior, using a scimitar as a two-hander for massive damage, or short sword and shield for still-pretty-good damage and more AC, or even dual-wielding kukris, very deadly.<br/>\n So, choose your primary weapon(s) (shortbow, scimitar, shortsword, or kukri) and I will make the first 40 levels of a build for each weapon chosen.<br/>\n Also, I need to know whether or not to include Dev Crit. It is banned? Is it changed, and if so, how?<br/>\n What about classes? Are there any classes that would be hard or impossible to use, like RDD as a common example of banned or nerfed class?</div>",

That would probably be something like rog/ftr/SD and there are lots of those builds around for you to ruminate over. Unless rog/ftr levels are kept close, though... -20% XP penalty haunts.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n A ftr/Asn/SD would avoid XP pen, yield many Grt DEX bonus with enough Asn but lose out on ED.\u00a0 You'd be able to DA with ranged or melee attacks, especially with Darkness.<br/>\n<br/>\n Else, you could potentially go ftr/brd/rdd for the draconic goodies since there will be an XP penalty with rogue as well. Finessing DW would work but ED not possible with that split.<br/>\n An STR build is easier but tactically limited.\u00a0 And same deal with the XP penalty.\u00a0 Only a double prestige will avoid penalty.<br/>\n<br/>\n Since you haven't mentioned any class, race or feat restrictions/modifications any suggestions the guild makes are being made blind, for whatever help that may prove for you.\u00a0 There are so many alternatives, it's really difficult to settle on a no-miss combo at this point.</div>"
