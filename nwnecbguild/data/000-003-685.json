      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">I wish I could have made the subject title a spoiler, but it appears I can't.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've just finished a Baldur's and Baldur's 2 run-through and before embarking on another Dragon Age run, I'm at something of a loose end (there, that's my excuses out of the way). Thus, I find myself thinking about forbidden subjects - namely magic and its uses.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, a couple of things to get out of the way...I've never made an arcanist before, so will need even more babysitting than usual - yes, it's another round of dumb-ass questions from Stag on its way! Second, I've decided on Sorcerer for my first foray. Being a meleer by nature, all that preparation of spells that Wizard entails leaves me cold - give me spontaneous casting any day. Third (yes, I know...), if I'm going to do it, I don't want to confuse myself by being a spellsword or melee-mage: I want to stand behind and hurl horridness at things from afar.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first thought was to harness the CHA synergy between Sorcerer and Bard, but then two things happened. I realized that the Sorcerer spells were always going to supercede the Bard ones, so in effect Bard would only be there for song, Tumble, and Lore, and given that I'm looking at about 26 levels of Sorcerer that wouldn't amount to very much. The second thing that happened was that I looked up the prospective classes in the Guild Filter and the Legacy Archive and there were none, which was a pretty big clue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I thought about other classes with potential synergy Pally, BG and CoT. I ruled BG out purely on the basis of not wanting 2 classes I've never played before at the same time, let alone having to be evil. Pally then went in the bin having seen Valerfor's Battle Sorceress, because it's both a combat pc and far too good a build for me to get close to. So, CoT, for a bit of occasional smiting (oh, and bonus feats and saves, too).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I was left wondering about a 3rd class. Rogue has its appeal, as it always does, but guess what popped into my mind... Yep, Monk. A little speed, Tumble, and gear.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's probably about time I asked a question now (if anyone's still awake). Is the idea of a Sorcerer/ Monk/ CoT build a stupid one? I'm currently toying with a Sorc 26/ Monk 4/ CoT 10 split, but I don't want to hurtle down a dead-end immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone about this, thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Sorry, should have said that I'm looking at human. Would have been dwarf but for the CHA pen or gnome but for the xp pen. And human gets an extra feat and skill points, obvs<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If you hold a weapon, it is because it has item properties you want.<br/>\n2) Spell DC and Spell penertation are your new AB. You can either start reading up on it, or you can just take my word for it and get a<strong> high Cha</strong> (if sorcerer) for the Spell DC and a <strong>high casterlevel</strong> for the Spell penetration. There are feats to enhance both further, but that is secondary.<br/>\n3) A high caster ability (Cha for sorcerer) also grants you extra spell slots<br/>\n4) Keeping a high caster level while leveling pre epic is essential for getting powerful spells as soon as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond (secret) lesson for building a sorcerer:<br/>\nYou want a high spell DC to prevent your target from saving versus your spells. You want to focus on one or two spell schools to improve the DC of those spells. You have three feats you can take: Spell focus, Greater SF and Epic SF in any given spell school. You need the first to take the second, and the second to take the third. Each adds +2 to the DC of spells from that school. <br/>\nYou want a high enough Spell penetration to ovecome the Spell resistance of your target. You may need to boost this with extra feats if you multiclass and lower your caster level, if you take your mage to an area with foes above your level or if you just happen to play a module where the designer has added a high SR to bosses or just given SR to more monsters than usual. So this may be circumstantial.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird (silent) lesson for building a sorcerer:<br/>\nThere is something called meta magic. It has two uses: 1) It changes the spell 2) it makes it possible to cast the same spell from spell slots of different spell levels. The first is important for all mages. The last is especially important for spontaneous casters, like the Sorcerer. My hottest for a sorcerer are: extend, empower, maximize and silent.<br/>\n<br/>\nForth...<span style=\"color:#999999\">.shhhh</span><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks Mick. Given that none of the great and good have produced a Sorcerers' Guide in the Game Guides section (irresponsible people that you are), I've just had to go by what I can pick up from other builds and the wiki. Which only further confuses me as often as not.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I do remember about meta magic - I had a thread back in 2017 entitled \"Explaining Meta Magic to a Monkey\" - a little sly learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile researching a bit about these infernal arts, when I half-contemplated Wiz, I particularly liked the look of Evocation and Conjuration schools - kewl AoE effects apart from anything else - and if I'm going to stand on a hilltop in a dress with my hands aloft I want it to look pretty damned impressive. I'll confess, not specializing as a Wiz was another attraction to going for Sorcerer.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, as for the other (secret, on tiptoes) info... Effectively, the deal is to swap combat feats for arcane ones. Thus, Blind Fight, Knockdown, Imp Crit can all hit the high road (I might still want to keep one or two, just in case) - particularly as a non-melee build. Then crank up both potency and volume. Hence the meta malarkey and things like Still, Extend, Empower and Max.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, my biggest problem (and this is only a guess, there may be way bigger ones) is likely to be preventing myself from being too squishy, which is why I was wondering about Monk and CoT as potential complementary classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so the story that no one will ever know moves on...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Forth lesson for building as sorcerer (don't tell anybody):<br/>\nDefense:<br/>\nYou already know how AC works. It works in the same way for casters.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is even possible (shh), but somehow complicated to use shield and armor. You will then need the armor and shield feats. The best way to get them is to take a level of a class that gets them at lvl 1 like fighter, paladin, blackguard and cleric. Armor and shield interfere with arcane spells and can cause you to fail at casting your spells. You can still your spells (Still spell metamagic feat) and cast them at one spell level higher than normal, and you can take the epic Auto still feats and cast normally, despite your armor and shield. So using armor comes at a price. You have to spend feats and most probably you want to multiclass. Most sorcerers work well without, but on WoG they started playing a build known as the Exalted sorceress.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou already know how saves work. You have Spellcraft to improve the saves vs spells. You also have a fat Charisma that will give a great boost to saves if combined with the Divine grace feat of the Paladin or the Dark blessing feat of the Blackguard. This is one more of the ideas behind the Exalted sorceress. You don't have to use this, but you must know of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have good saves, Evasion can protect you from much elemental damage. You can get it early from several classes, already at lvl 1 from Monk. One more idea behind the Exalted sorceress.<br/>\nAnother point when using those classes is the access to Tumble as class skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have access to a lot of spells that come into play for defensive purposes. They can give you different forms of AC, Damage resistence, Damage reduction, absorption of elemental damage, Self concealment, Invisibility, spell absorption etc etc.<br/>\nBut how to use spells falls under the lessons for <strong>playing</strong> a sorcerer.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Let's assume 18-20 levels of human Sorcerer. That's 8 feats. If I ignore all combat and defensive feats (at least for now), there appear to be 10 caster feats that could be worthwhile - 9 if I go without armour/shield and so don't need Still Spell. These are Extend Spell, Empower Spell, Maximize Spell, Silent Spell, Spell Focus, Greater Spell Focus, Quicken Spell, Spell Penetration and Greater Spell Penetration.

Even the Exalted Sorceress has 3 classes. So I'm still keen to add a few levels of other classes myself, and the addition of Monk does seem reasonable (including in Mick's own Evil Speed Caster, above). CoT might seem an odd choice, and I'm thinking of it in epic levels only (and I appreciate I'd have to take a WF in a melee weapon first, thus losing another of the aforementioned mage feats), but it has a weird panoply of epic bonus feats, including Epic Spell Focus, Combat Casting, and so on, which could allow for more Sorcerer bonus feats in Great Charisma. It also brings Divine Wrath and great boosts to saves. In other words, I'm still thinking Sorcerer 26/ Monk 4/ CoT 10. Just tell me if it's stupid.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Spells</strong>. I entirely understand the number of base spells I can cast per day, but as far as \"known spells\" is concerned, once I \"know\" a spell, am I able to forget it and know another another one of the same level instead?

They serve you best if you have low caster levels or if you from some other reason struggle a lot with SR.<br/>\nQuicken spell let you cast immediately and adds a second casting per round. But you get the same all the time without the feat whenever you are hasted. Quicken let you cast from slots 4 levels above the original spell, so it is only useful with level 5 spells and lower. It may be useful if you decide that you need to cast a spell like Firebrand a zillion times, but most often you can live well without it.<br/>\nExtend, Silent and Still all cast from slots 1 level above the original spell. Extend is useful bercause it gives longer duration to \"rounds per level\" spells. Still and Silent work with more spells than Extend, and are useful for that reason. If casting in armor is not a problem, you pick Silent. <br/>\nSome people take the Combat casting and Improved CC feats. A high Concentration skill will be enough in most cases to avoid attacks of opportunity in defensive casting mode and spell failure from taking heavy blows.<br/>\nIn vanilla NWN you can cast in Expertise mode and get +5 and even +10 AC for free since you don't suffer from the AB penalty. Many module designers and PW owners have disabled that \u00a0possibility, but sometimes taking both Expertise feats are worth it.<br/>\nAs for the spell focus feats, grab both SF and GSF (and also ESF) in one school, and take two schools if you can afford it.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>\n<strong>Starting Stats</strong>.

Concentration and \u00a0Spellcraft are a must. If you want more skills depends on what kind of build you make. You need 13 Int if you want Expertise. 14 int gives a modifies Spellcraft of 45 whith full ranks. 12 Int gives Spellcraft 50 with capped Intelligence, and so on.<br/>\nPeople differ a bit when choosing between Strength, Dexterity and Constitution. You can boost them all with empowered spells if you want. I prefer Constitution for the hitpoints since this is a d4 build. Strength is good for carrying and for melee mages. Dexterity helps a bit in early levels when you hide behind your mighty badger and familiar, anxiously squeezing an x-bow between your swaety hands.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>\n<strong>Class Split</strong>.

I was particularly fond of the mighty badger and the sweaty hands (goodness gracious!).<br/>\n<br/>\nPlenty more to ponder. I still can't help myself, it seems, when left to my own devices I start running straight into the sharpened arms of a meleer (sorry, \"spellsword\" to be fancy about it). Okay, any future twitchiness will, for now, be the result of either too much or too little whisky.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I need to read up on more of the spells themselves. Actually, there's something to be said about this, I feel. You clever wombats who've been coming up with casters for years hardly ever give your recommendations for spells - shame on you! It's like a Fighter build just saying, \"Take lots of combat feats.\" I appreciate that's not an entirely accurate analogy, but I trust you get my point.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers (He signs off with harrumphing indignation <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" />)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Your high caster level also secures a very good SR penetration.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don't twitch, you can squeeze in another greater spell focus by removing Expertise and Quicken. You will soon learn other ways than AC to avoid damage. You may even take the epic focus in the second school, if you only take one epic spell. As for schools I often pick Evocation or Necromancy or both.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother question is when to take the feats, and in what order. The simplest answer to that is - when you need them.<br/>\nI would take SF early and GSF somewhere in mid-pre-epic. The level where you take meta-magic feats looks good<br/>\nNote that epic spells need a given rank in spellcraft. If you want them, take them as early as possible (unless it messes with something you have given priority).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for what spells belong to what schools, the logic is beyond me as well. Look up the NWNWIKI and find a table that sorts spells by school, just so you know what you're dealing with.<br/>\n<br/>\nFormula for spell DC:<br/>\n<em>DC = 10 + spell level + ability modifier + feat modifier</em><br/>\nThe level 40 Soren has a feat modifier of 6 for his chosen school and the abilify modifier is 14 unbuffed and 20 when capped. Add 1 for level 1 spells and upwards to 9 for level 9 spells. A level 1 spell from an unfocused school has a DC of 25 if there are no charisma buffs. A level 9 spell from the focused school has DC of 45 when you cap charisma.<br/>\n<br/>\nLvl 40 Soren will always penetrate SR 41, and can penetrate SR 42 to 60 depending on a d20 roll.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Now imagine you Cha modifier added :) But first, I think Nick and Val are right, do it pure. You'll have other ways of not being affected by spells.<br/>\nConsider Necro for one of your SF. Wail of the banshee is a top spell (4x better than weird) but it has a saving throw.<br/>\nDepending on where you play, scribe scroll or craft wand can be taken instead of expertise (I love wands, but that's a personal preference and a WoGism.)<br/>\nThe last theoretical bit that remains: spell choice and how it changes during leveling.<br/>\nAnd finally, the big one: how to play. I'm not just thinking about the theory. A lot of it, more than with any other class, is execution.

That gave me 2 spare epic feats (because I was always going to take Epic Spell Focus) and Hellball or Greater Ruin sounded kewl, while Epic Warding or Epic Mage Armour sounded sensible (it's all about balance). However, if I'm going truly untwitchy, I'm fine with Mick's suggestion about dropping Expertise and Quicken (as Haste will have a similar effect in any case) pre-epic and picking up another focus and its greater cousin, then dropping an Epic Spell for the epic focus. That way I could have both Evocation (fun) and Necromancy (serious - see, balance again). It's not that I've changed my mind about liking Conjuration (I've always liked Melf's Acid Arrow, Flame Arrow and Cloudkill), but Horrid Wilting and Wail of the Banshee (as well as all that negative energy stuff) are hard to ignore.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I go down that route, then I'm fine to drop INT to 12 - losing Heal or Lore - and popping a couple more points into Dex (I don't like it being of a negative value, even if in \"full plate and packing sword\").<br/>\n<br/>\nYou're quite right about the yardstick Mirnaia, but it's kind of hard not to semi-duplicate it given the lack of bonus feats available (in pre-epic, at least) without deliberately gimping yourself. But I promise I did construct this myself before looking back at the build (which, btw, I had wrong, it was D'Alessandro's build, and is on page 4 of the thread).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this is where it all goes t*ts up. I can't actually play the damned build atm, so theory is the only place I have left. Clearly, this is the type of build that needs to be practiced with, and it would be pointless to ask someone to test it for me. First, because I've already got Mirnaia running another putative build around for me (brilliantly), and second, I think I'd really need to get a proper feel for this one myself, having never played a Sorcerer in NwN before.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

(*<em>mutters</em>* And still no one respects \"tell no one\"...*<em>sulks</em>*)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlas, no, I haven't yet taken Soren out for a run - I'm furtling around with a couple of potential builds currently (a Half-Orc and a Halfling). But I do seem to recall having made an idiotic deal with conlaoch that involves me playing a caster and him a cleric sometime this year.

There is an x-bow \u00a0she had with some magical properties. Between act 1 and 2 I exported the character and crafted a spear with the same properties, just for style. I could have done the same with a mage staff or any other simple weapon. It had no impact on game play.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
