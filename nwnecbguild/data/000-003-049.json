This build is for all those PWs out there that have made happy adjustments to the Shadowdancer class. I\u2019ve played in several now where Shadow Evade has been given some actual use, and the duration is based on level, or have given Shadowdaze more teeth, or have altered the Shadowlord summons, and so on. Even if HiPS has been changed, given a cool-down period, or nerfed outright, this kind of character can still enjoy success. To explain the goal of this kind of character, it\u2019s simply to maximize the utilities of the Shadowdancer class while still maintaining a healthy melee presence.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, we wanted an assassin-like character, except instead of using Death Attack, we use Dev Crit. We maximize SD levels to give us the most out of Shadow Evade and to grab that great DR it grants at higher levels, as well as that juicy Shadowdaze DC. Even in Full Plate this character will have the same steath score as if he were naked and dex-based with a 26 Dex. We use the the SD bonus feats in a way one not normally sees SD feats used\u2014for Epic Skill Focus feats. With 5 of those coming in Epic levels, there is lots of room for customization. Hide and Move Silently are a must, and the 3rd I nodded to the Epic Summons, and then I choose Taunt and Discipline because those things are important to me and my playstyle. I can easily see someone giving those up for Listen/Spot or UMD/Search, etc\u2026.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019ve done this kind of character before, such as in The Assassin King or the Zhentarim Field Agent, in which Strength-based stealthers launch from the shadows to lay waste with their sneak attacks. Since it hasn\u2019t been done this way, I thought I\u2019d post the full-blooded SD version. I\u2019ve done other versions that were also quite fun, and did a Halfling version (had to swap Rogue for Bard) that got an even better Stealth score. Dwarf also works well with this, but you have to give up 43 skill points. The non-Dev Crit version got a slightly better AB and finished with Improved Expertise and Improved Disarm, which may be a nice option if Dev Crit is banned on your server. If Shadowdancers haven\u2019t been given incentives to go deeper into levels on your PW, then this build may not be for you, though would still be playable and unique.<br/>\n<br/>\nHalberd was chosen for coolness factor, though admittedly Greatsword would be better for crit efficiency. What\u2019s nice about the Halberd is that it does to damage types, and 1.69 finally got that 2 damage type bug fixed. Comments and flames welcome. Cheers.</div></blockquote>\n\nMy question is, how would you rework this build for a level 30 environment using the Amia rules? These are the rules in general (they're really simple actually).\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.amiaworld.net/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;p=934718#p934718\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.amiaworld.net/phpBB3/viewtop ... 18#p934718</a>\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyone want to give it a shot?\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!</div>"

      "content": "<div>The build can be adapted to the Amia rules (as far as I know them). But Dev Crit is nerfed and HIPS comes later than normal.<br/>\nI have made a level 30 build that has several similarities. I dropped Dev crit and some of the prerequisites for the above reason and since there are really few epic feats in a level 30 build. I added Expertise that can be used with Taunt. And I added Concentration that helps resist taunts. I stopped UMD at 11 (10) because Bards need no more for scrolls, and I guess Amia is not high magic.
