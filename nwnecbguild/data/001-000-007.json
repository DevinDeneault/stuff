I did and now I can launch the app, the first screen comes up fine; clicking play every screen after that is a solid pink, it looks as if the normal process is going on, yet cannot see or click on anything. Have to use task manager to end the app. Is anyone experiencing this also? I have placed a support ticket but have yet to hear back from them - which make me believe that it has effected a lot of people.</div>"

I read on the beamdog site that it could be something with the override files. I deleted the override and it relaunched with no issues, until the last screen where you can choose to do multiplayer or play the game. When it stated that it needed the override - thinking that maybe something got messed up when I first updated. Did another upgrade but same issue. I will be next checking the files in the override directory and see if I can find the one(s) causing the issue.</div>"
