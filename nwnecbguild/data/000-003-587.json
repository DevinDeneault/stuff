      "content": "<div>Without playing on your server I can't recommend a specific build for a beginner, since what works on some servers doesn't work on others.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk9/Cler26/SD5 is normally a decent beginner build on a server assuming that you know how to use the build properly. If you've never played a Cleric before you might struggle, but it has Epic Dodge and many useful spells to help in tough battles. It has +63 AB / 85 AC with Flurry Of Blows, or you can get +55 AB / 95 AC in Improved Expertise if you want to play defensively. In parties it can cover both healing and AC tanking which makes it very useful for party PvM.<br/>\n<br/>\nPal28/Bard2/RDD10 (or Pal26/Bard4/RDD10) requires a lot of buffing and you need to keep those buffs up during the fight. With IExp it has +65 AB / 98 AC when fully buffed, high saves, and immunity to Disease, Fear, Fire, and Paralysis. Mechanically it's one of the stronger choices but if you don't have much experience with a buffing playstyle it will be tough to adapt.<br/>\n<br/>\nRog13/Figh8/WM19 is the easiest of these three builds, you just point and click. With Improved Expertise it has +59 AB / 96 AC, plus it also has Epic Dodge as an additional defence. The Fortitude and Will saves are pretty low, but depending on your server this might not be a problem.</div>"

If you've never played a Cleric before you might struggle, but it has Epic Dodge and many useful spells to help in tough battles. It has +63 AB / 85 AC with Flurry Of Blows, or you can get +55 AB / 95 AC in Improved Expertise if you want to play defensively. In parties it can cover both healing and AC tanking which makes it very useful for party PvM.<br/>\n<br/>\nPal28/Bard2/RDD10 (or Pal26/Bard4/RDD10) requires a lot of buffing and you need to keep those buffs up during the fight. With IExp it has +65 AB / 98 AC when fully buffed, high saves, and immunity to Disease, Fear, Fire, and Paralysis. Mechanically it's one of the stronger choices but if you don't have much experience with a buffing playstyle it will be tough to adapt.<br/>\n<br/>\nRog13/Figh8/WM19 is the easiest of these three builds, you just point and click. With Improved Expertise it has +59 AB / 96 AC, plus it also has Epic Dodge as an additional defence. The Fortitude and Will saves are pretty low, but depending on your server this might not be a problem.</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">\nThe cleric, many times I have thought about it, but in this service it seems that the clergymen and druids have their spells very nerfed, harm the masses for example or heal the masses, they are eliminated, so I never considered using them, although they have very good looking</div>\n<div align=\"left\">\nthese do not look bad as you raised them</div>\n<div align=\"left\">Pal28/Bard2/RDD10 (or Pal26/Bard4/RDD10)</div>\n<div align=\"left\">Rog13/Figh8/WM19\u00a0 (this is very similar to one that I was using at the beginning\u00a0 monk34/ds5/rog1 weapon: disarm,<br/>\nIt was quite good to level and advance, but when I reached the 1st boss, 20 min of combat and 0 effective shots for inmunit for critc and furtive)</div>\n<div align=\"left\">Monk9/Cler26/SD5\u00a0 (I liked this one a lot, but as I said before, I am totally null outside the monk, so many years of play and I never left the monk hehehe</div>\n<div align=\"center\">New mail</div>\n<div align=\"center\">Copy</div></div>"

It looks like he is sneak immune ?crit immune. Cold damage affects him. It looks like Smaug has some physical damage immunity. You seem to be doing 10 damage to him with your equipment. His non critical hit did 78 damage. Couldn't see another hit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the second log I can see El Rey de los Muertos's AB is 95/90/85/80. Your character is hitting him with attack rolls of\u00a0 67 but missing with attack rolls of 52 presumably his AC is between 53 and 67. It looks like he is acid immune, sneak immune, and has some physical resistances. It looks like you can do some magical damage, although I am unsure whether there is magical resistance/immunity. Not sure how much damage he does it looks like there is some acid damage which you resisted.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in summary your opponents:<br/>\n- have very high AB<br/>\n- your character can hit them with 52 AB but you seem to not do any physical damage only magical damage. No acid damage.<br/>\n- there is physical damage resistance and possibly immunity<br/>\n- there is sneak immunity and possibly critical hit immunity (unclear from the log)<br/>\n- there could be acid immunity<br/>\n- unsure about magical resistance/immunity<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a tricky puzzle in my mind.\u00a0<br/>\nI'll let the others comment from the physical combatant side of things since they have analysed that more than I have.\u00a0<br/>\nI will say with such a high enemy AB and dealing around 80 damage, I do worry about critical hits.\u00a0<br/>\nCan critical hit immunity come from items? Then you can avoid getting palemaster.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the caster perspective Mestil's Acid Sheath won't be effective against the second boss.<br/>\nUnclear if elemental shield will help (?fire immune).<br/>\nIGMS / death armor might be effective but unsure magic resistance is there in the second boss, unsure about the first one.<br/>\nAura vs alignment on a sequencer could be considered, holy aura / unholy aura will do divine damage or negative damage respectively. If they do not resist divine or negative damage then this could help, possibly do more damage against him than your attacks, noting your attack against the first boss did 10 damage.\u00a0</div>"

Either cleric or UMD 20 as you say seems valuable.<br/>\nPerhaps <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/viewtopic.php?p=18524#p18524\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mestil's Crafty Juggernaut</a> could be an option, although I have not yet fully playtested that build idea, it is a minor variation on GDL's Half-Dead Juggernaut using Rogue (for skills, evasion) instead of fighter, it has less HP because EDR III has to be taken as general epic feats rather than bonus fighter feats. But it gets you UMD, and you also get evasion (although you can drop rogue down to 1 for more wizard caster levels, if you want).<br/>\nPut the shields up, cast extended haste, spam empowered and maximised IGMS.<br/>\n400+ damage / round from the IGMS x2, plus 300-350 damage / round from the damage shields.\u00a0<br/>\nIt has about nearly 900 HP with Con capped. If you can get some physical damage resistance / immunity as Yunim has suggested I think you can last a while.<br/>\nCast greater sanctuary or time stop to get yourself out of danger. Can even scribe them onto scrolls so there is no concentration check.<br/>\nYunim brings up a nice point about the bosses possibly having +20 weapons to penetrate epic warding.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Below is a minmaxed Rog13/Figh8/WM19, if you can get the right gear it should be able to solo some of the bosses. There are multiple other builds that should do well solo, but most of them either require buffing multiple abilities (eg Monk9/Cler26/SD5 and Pal28/Bard2/RDD10) or prior knowledge of the server (eg Rang26/Figh4/SD10).<br/>\nIn Improved Expertise the build has +59 AB, 96 AC (+1 with Dodge), and Epic Dodge. When combined with DI/DR and concealment this should be enough to go a few rounds before it requires healing.<br/>\nThere are several problems with the build, such as low Discipline and terrible saves, but it should be able to survive the actual combat. If saves are important on the server then you will need a different build.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of gear you should be aiming for +12 DEX, +12 CON, at least +8 AC items, haste, 25% physical DI, 15/- physical DRes, some form of concealment, and some form of healing. The build has 40 UMD so you shouldn't have a problem using the staff.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I dislike fully minmaxed builds, but in this case it's probably best to minmax first and then rebuild to be more balanced if you can afford to. If you do choose to rebuild it in the future, drop the starting DEX to 18 and swap some G DEX feats for other feats like ESF: Discipline, Epic Fortitude, or Epic Will.<br/>\nToughness is the only spare feat in the build if you minmax, I opted to ignore IC: Shortsword and Knockdown since critical immunity is common and knockdown probably won't work as a halfling. Maybe consider swapping it for a saves feat like Luck Of Heroes or Iron Will, but don't bother swapping it for a combat feat.<br/>\nI chose shortsword for the weapon, but if you can't land crits then the only real difference between handaxe, mace, and shortsword is the damage type. I don't know which damage type is best for your server, so consider changing shortsword to another finessable weapon if you think that's best. It's also possible to drop feats to focus in two weapons, but I decided against it since I don't know if that's worth doing on your server.<br/>\nThere are a lot of spare skill points for this build so I invested in Set Trap and Spot. If there aren't any useful traps or if none of the mobs use stealth then you can drop them for something else.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nClass: Rogue 13 / Fighter 8 / Weapon Master 19<br/>\nRace:

similar, but I think it is not the same, I do not know if this configuration would also work with this race<br/>\nDwarf ,Uruk-hai,Elf,Half-elves,Minotaur.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like the idea of the short sword, regarding damage, being a crafted weapon is the damage that I put on it, even if it is a sword I can put forceful, acid and penetrating damage, the one that I see best, some improvement with regarding the mace or ax? or are they the same base stats? Also, this character setup, is it to just go for the short sword? short sword and shield? I don't rule out the 2 short sword setup unless I drop the AB a lot, as secondary weapons I can focus on defense, vampiric regeneration, resistance to the elements, etc<br/>\nAnd ty for you time and help ^^\u00a0 I love you ^^</div>"

      "content": "<div>You can change the race to elf but it will cause an XP penalty, you would need to use a tower shield instead of a large shield (+30 lbs), and you would lose 1 AB, 2 Fortitude, 1 Reflex, 1 Will, and 40 HP in exchange for +1 damage and Keen Sense. If you do go for an elf change the starting abilities from 8STR/14CON to 10STR/12CON, everything else is the same. Also change the weapon choice from handaxe/mace/shortsword to handaxe/mace/rapier if you go for elf. Even if most monsters are immune to critical hits that change will help slightly against the ones that aren't.<br/>\n<br/>\nHandaxe (slashing) is 1d6 (x3), mace (bludgeoning) is 1d6 (x2), rapier (piercing) is 1d6 (18-20/x2), shortsword (piercing) is 1d6 (19-20/x2). If you're fighting critical hit immune monsters then the only difference between these weapons is the base damage type, which is important for DI/DR.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon't put piercing damage on a rapier or shortsword, it doesn't stack with the extra damage from EB. For the rapier/shortsword (piercing weapon) you should add Bludgeoning and Slashing damage but not Piercing damage. This changes depending on the weapon, so for a mace (bludgeoning weapon) you shouldn't add Bludgeoning damage, and for a handaxe (slashing weapon) you shouldn't add Slashing damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nDropping the shield is a very bad idea for this build, you lose 3 feats and (at least) 10 AC in exchange for 2 more attacks per round. If you were planning to work alongside a tank then it would be fine, but if you're soloing then you will need as much AC, concealment, and DI/DR as possible. When I said to focus in two weapons I meant to get AB feats for two different weapons so that you can switch between them, such as getting WF: Mace, EWF: Mace, and Weapon Of Choice: Mace as well as the rapier/shortsword feats.\u00a0You should still use a shield when using the other weapons.<br/>\nPersonally I recommend carrying multiple weapons with different damage types on servers that are built around DI/DR even if your AB with the other weapons is lower. Your AB with a mace or handaxe would be 7 points lower than your AB with a rapier/shortsword, but the difference in DI/DR could be more important than the loss of AB.\u00a0For example, let's say you're fighting with a rapier/shortsword but your opponent has 50% Piercing DI and 0% Bludgeoning DI. In that scenario it might be worth switching to a mace even if your AB is lower when using a mace.</div>"

If you also swap the +12 CHA for +12 CON that will result in 48 Fortitude, although I don't know if that will be high enough. If you rebuild it completely then you could also drop the starting DEX to 18 and increase your starting STR and CON slightly.</div>"
