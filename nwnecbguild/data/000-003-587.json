Or rogue for extra sneak attack, evasion and uncanny dodge/epic dodge. Or Bard for its amazing skills.<br/>\nBarbarians have certain nice synergies with a high Dex AA, most importantly Uncanny Dodge (to protect the Dex AC at all times) which fighter, bard or paladin does not provide.\u00a0<br/>\nThe d12 hit die and barbarian speed also are nice along with a full BAB class.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere I try to make the highest possible\u00a0dex and AB AA while also having uncanny dodge.\u00a0I thought I would share what I worked on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt obtains ranged AB 63 and Dex 40-&gt;52 from Great Dexterity X.<br/>\nIt has base 344hp and a naked AC of 29. With +5 items and capped dexterity the AC hits 55 (63 with a +5 tower shield but he or she will always want to be shooting with a bow).<br/>\nHe or she will not want to be tanking damage however as it triggers attacks of opportunity. Tumble 20(35) with barbarian speed should help, along with the ability to use Wizard scrolls for summons, improved invisibility and haste.<br/>\nThe F22 W17 R34 saves don't look great on first glance, but there is +5 against spells and +2 against mind effects, so the effective fort save against most death magic and implosions is 27 and effective will save is 24, plus the wizard level allows for scrolls such as shadow shield (death magic immunity) and prot v alignment/mind blank (mind immunity), admittedly all dispellable but this is common to all combat builds.\u00a0<br/>\nAlso wizard robes tend to be cooler than the usual robes and the wizard level helps equipping those without UMD.<br/>\nI put Int to 14 and Con to 8 to give the build stealth skills with all that dexterity, it can also set and retrieve up to deadly traps, and open DC 52 locks with a +10 pick and capped dexterity (16+20+10+6).<br/>\nIf stealth is not desired then Con can be put to 12 and Int to 10 for over 400 hp and +2 to fort.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought about putting weapon finesse in the build. With weapon finesse, any finessable mundane weapon would have an AB of 45 without needing any weapon focus feats. I figured this was not worthwhile given it would do very little damage (1d6 /17-20x2 +2-8) compared with the builds arrow damage (1-8 / 19-20x3 +15 +2-8 mighty plus arrow damage) but I can see how it might be attractive against a mob with a heavily enchanted flamed weapon'ed rapier and +5 tower shield. AA 30 was taken for the final bonus feat for Great Dexterity X but swapping wizard to bard and putting AA to 29 for a late spellcraft, tumble and discipline dump was also tempting for -1AB and 20% xp penalties.\u00a0<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Barbarian(8), Wizard(2), Arcane Archer(30), Elf\nPvM 1-40 low to mid magic\nSTR: 14\nCON: 8\nINT: 14\n\n01: Barbarian(1): Point Blank Shot\n03: Barbarian(3): Weapon Focus: Longbow\n05: Barbarian(5)\n07: Wizard(1): {Scribe Scroll}\n09: Arcane Archer(2): Improved Critical: Longbow\n11: Arcane Archer(4)\n13: Arcane Archer(6)\n15: Arcane Archer(8): Called Shot\n17: Arcane Archer(10)\n19: Barbarian(8)\n21: Arcane Archer(11): Great Dexterity I, (DEX=26)\n23: Arcane Archer(13)\n25: Arcane Archer(15)\n27: Arcane Archer(17): Great Dexterity III, (DEX=29)\n29: Arcane Archer(19)\n31: Arcane Archer(21)\n33: Arcane Archer(23): Great Dexterity VI, (DEX=34)\n35: Arcane Archer(25)\n37: Arcane Archer(27)\n39: Arcane Archer(29): Great Dexterity IX, (DEX=38)\n\nSkillpoints: 254\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +5, Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +1\nAB (max, naked): 32 (melee), 63 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Wizard(1)\n</details>\n<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>ECB Archives\nLittle John, Wildwood Lieutenant (EDR3 TR-Archer) barbarian 15 / arcane archer 23 / bard 2 (half-elf) by TyrTemplar\nThe Angry Archer barbarian 21 / bard 2 / arcane archer 17 (half-elf?) by Xylophone\nOverwhelming Thunder barbarian 21 / sorcerer 1 / arcane archer 18 (half-elf) by sbtedarknight\n Bard 10 / AA 30 by\u00a0Nimueh_Leafbow\nECB filter search (ECB Tapatalk Forum)\nAA 9 / Wiz 8 / Brb 3 -\u00a0</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Here you want dex 40 and must go with Elf, so bard will give an XP penalty. Otherwise, I would choose half-elf and go bard/barbarian/AA.
