      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">I invented this dragon-warrior some time ago, when i was in search of additional sources of AC for a STR-based character that can take upon some extreme challenges presented in WoG, such as face-tanking the \"White Dragon King\" and similar things. That is, i wanted a straight-up beater, no temporal buffs of any kind that would be lost from a well placed Dispel/ Mord's or anything else. It seems that the only extra sources of this kind would come from a pale master and nothing else, but these characters have their own agenda, so i was left with a choice that i would not normally take under normal circumstances. And so i took upon the chalenge and worked full time on that, making what you are gonna see below and i was quite satisfied so to say, from the final results. This character has a constant 70 AC in WoG (and WoG is on the low side of madium -magic PW's), that rises to 80 AC when he makes use of his improved expertise fighting mode. I made a point also to have the earliest possible full-blown RDD for extreme playability, it is basically a lvl 20 builded RDD in a lvl 40 build for that purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\n Possibly the only build that compares with this one, is the \"Avatar of the forge\" by grizzled_dwarflord, they have a similar concept, mine is quite a bit more tanky so to say, while his build has some buff potencial and a slightly better song because he takes 12 lvls of Bard.<br/>\n<br/>\n Avatar of the forge --&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build200533.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 00533.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n The opposite of this build (Bard 20/ Rdd 10/ Ftr 10), works really well too and maybe it is slightly better overall but it looses quite a bit on the hp's department and has no DR to speak off and anyway it is a build already well-known by now, but i will leave that kind of build for a future concept and move on to what we have now at our hands.<br/>\n<br/>\n -- Draco Mauler has the earliest possible full RDD development from all dragon builds.<br/>\n -- Draco Mauler has the best tanking abilities amongst all of his breathren, including concentration skill and a dragonic armour that has almost double the thickness.<br/>\n -- Draco Mauler has an incredible amount of hp's &amp; a moderate amount of DR, backed up with solid saves and that is especially true when it comes against spellcasters.<br/>\n -- Draco Mauler hits incredibly hard with his all-natural 40 STR further utilising advanced Fighter techniques (EWS) and Arcane knowledge (UMD).<br/>\n<br/>\n And that's it, a straight-up scrapper that will never let you down and is playable from the start-up, enjoy!<br/>\n<br/>\n DRACO MAULER (FTR 10/ BARD 4/ RDD 26)<br/>\n<br/>\n RACE: Dwarf<br/>\n<br/>\n ALIGNMENT: <strong><span style=\"color:#FF0000\">Any non-lawful</span></strong> (Chaotic Neutral, <strong><span style=\"color:#FF0000\">recommended</span></strong>)<br/>\n<br/>\n PLAYABILITY: PvM 1-40<br/>\n<br/>\n STARTING/ ENDING STATS:<br/>\n<br/>\n STR \u2013 17 (40)<br/>\n DEX \u2013 09<br/>\n CON \u2013 18 (22)<br/>\n INT - 14 (16)<br/>\n WIS - 08<br/>\n CHA \u2013 06 (08)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hit Points: 700 <strong><span style=\"color:#FF0000\">[Max: 680]</span></strong><br/>\n<br/>\n Skill Points: 206<br/>\n Concentration: 37 (43)<br/>\n Discipline: 43 (58)<br/>\n Lore: 8 (16)<br/>\n Perform: 10 (9)<br/>\n Spellcraft: 42 (45)<br/>\n Tumble: 40 (39)<br/>\n UMD: 26 (25)<br/>\n<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fort/Ref/Will): 31/ 19/ 21 \u2192 42/ 30/ 32 (saves Vs spells)<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"color:#FF0000\">Add'l saves: Poison: +2</span></strong><br/>\n<br/>\n Naked/ Armoured AC: 26/<strong><span style=\"color:#FF0000\">37 (mundane armor/shield)</span></strong> 39 (Full plate &amp; T.
