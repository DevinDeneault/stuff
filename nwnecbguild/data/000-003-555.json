      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hi everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\nHope all are well.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome time ago (like 15-18 years) my sister and I played together on one of the first Nordock servers as drows. We were in one of two biggest families in the whole Underdark with the most amazing ppl we could possibly play as teens. Not only we have learned how to live in an online rpg society, but also we were shown how a drow family looks like with the whole hierarchy, intrigue and all the good stuff.\u00a0<br/>\nAs those were our first rpg characters ever we decided to start easy and play as siblings who were best friends (yeah, I know).\u00a0<br/>\nWherever we went we always went together. Even DMs created a special events to separate us so other could save another some time to time.\u00a0<br/>\nSo long story short the server, ppl and everything was amazing. Of course, nothing last forever and server went down coz at some point there was no one interested in playing at some point.<br/>\n<br/>\nI came back to NWN +/- 2 years ago and was playing campaing, found a new Nordock and couple others server so I stayed till today. My sister on the other hand didn't play ANY game in last 10 years. So for her's birthday last month I decided to buy her NWN: EE and convinced her to start playing again. Of course she was happy as hell and even proposed that we could continue our adventure as those drow siblings. In a heartbeat I started to think how will I write my toons history. What happend with him when he got separated from his family, and why. Was there a giant earthquake that destroyed the city they lived in, or was there a great war with other family/surface ppl? And what skills and feats he gain during all those years... In other words what classes he will have. And then it came up to me... I need a build(s)!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that is why I am here... My sister knows nothing about making decent builds and I only know where to search or where to ask for one, hehe.<br/>\nSo here I am, asking you to recommend not one, but two builds that will support each other. My sister was a high priest so she definatelly had a cleric class. I was her scout and muscles so If I'm not mistaken I was a fighter mixed with ranger or rogue fighting with bow and two short swords. The build was aweful, but it was fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I prepared a build request template (below). For my sister I think it's gonna be easy as all she said she wants is \"A powerful cleric build that will be able to save your pity butt every time you come up with one of your great ideas like putting an invisibility spell on yourself and then go sneaky on that dragon and his shiny treasure.\" In my defence, I did it JUST once, I was new to the whole D&amp;D stuff and freakin' DM told me that \"only your imagination holds you from doing something that will last in memory forever.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for myself? Not sure what will suit me best. I'm torn between a bow focused sneaky assassin with hips and monk speed or a two weapon figting silent killer.\u00a0<br/>\nI know I will need a high AB because the server we will play on has it's bosses, and raids so there are mobs with even 85 AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think that's all. Thank you all for reading and for any propositions. Will appreciate everything!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1) PvM or PvP -Both PvM please with a high AB for my toon and a decent tank build for my sister<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Level cap - 40<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Race preference - Elf/Drow stats below:\n<ul>\n<li>Ability Bonus: Charisma +2</li>\n<li>Ability Bonus: Intelligence +2</li>\n<li>Darkvision</li>\n<li>Saving Throw Bonus: Specific: Will +2</li>\n<li>Skill Bonus: Hide +2</li>\n<li>Skill Bonus: Move Silently +2</li>\n<li>Abilities from the unique item:</li>\n<li>Cast Spell: Darkness (5) 1 Use Per Day</li>\n<li>Cast Spell: Light (1) 1 Use Per Day</li>\n<li>Must be Elf.\u00a0</li>\n<li>Light Sensitive.</li>\n<li>Favored Class - Male: Wizard, Female: Cleric.</li>\n<li>Can only be evil</li>\n<li>Spell Resistance: Base (at Level 1): 10, Max(at Level 40): 50.</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n4) Class preference - For my sister cleric, for me something fast, sneaky and deadly.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Melee preference -\u00a0fine with everything<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Range preference - fine with everything<br/>\n<br/>\n7) Weapon preference - My sister - whip or anything she could \"reprimand \"me with. As for myself - bow or shortswords but can go with anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n8) Maximum item enhancement - +5. +6 if lucky.<br/>\n<br/>\n9) Spellcasting - For my sister we think a support cleric that will be able to buff us will be most efficient. Maybe some necromancy as well? I would like to be a non-magic character if possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n10) Custom factors - Server is using PRC and it's a high magic server.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

But the DA damage works as before.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Thank you. I think I will go with Kama Shinobi that does not exist but with shortsword or something else istead of kama because the whole server is fighting with kamas. It's like there is no other weapon *_*<br/>\n<br/>\n\u00a0So now I just need a good elf/drow cleric build for my sister that will go with your Shinobi.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
