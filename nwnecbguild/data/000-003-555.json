      "content": "<div>Hey, Luck_Dragon!<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, there are many improvements I could suggest. Let's list them in numeric order:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- Go for a 3rd class. There is no situation in which this build wouldn't be better with a 3rd class. I'd suggest Monk. For these specific classes, you could go with Druid 24 / Fighter 14 / Monk 2. There is XP penalty involved, but IMO that's what would make it more optimal.<br/>\n2- Choose a weapon. There is no point in getting all those Fighter levels pre-epic if you're going to spread the feats and be bad with a lot of weapons instead of good with just one, which\u00a0 is what's recommendable.<br/>\n3- If you choose to get Spell Focus in your Druid, you need to know that the DCs will only be high if his casting stat (WIS) is high, otherwise, you're just wasting these feats, much like you are wasting the Fighter feats.<br/>\n4- If you want your DCs to be high, then you should invest in Wisdom. If you choose to specialize in the Sling, you can take Zen Archery to make Wisdom your combat stat as well.<br/>\n5- If you play a Druid, you should know that they fight in melee by taking the shapes of various beasts, and that said shapes will override the druid's physical stats. That means that if you plan to play this guy as a Druid, you probably should take ALL the points from STR, DEX and CON and put them somewhere else.\u00a0<br/>\n6- As Stag suggested, read my guide to the class, and you'll understand why I'm saying these things. While you're at it, please read my Complete Guide to the Basics of Building. It has a lot of information, but once you get the hang of it, it can be really helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!</div>",

      "content": "<div>If you're planning to use this on NS4 you should seriously consider getting Automatic Quicken Spell 3, Blinding Speed, and Dragon Knight.<br/>\nYou need AQ3 in order to cast 2 spells per round on NS4, all forms of Haste have been changed so that it doesn't increase casting speed.<br/>\nHaste is very important on NS4, so making a DEX build without Blinding Speed is a huge waste. At level 40 Blinding Speed has a duration of 8 minutes which is much better than the 1 minute vanilla duration.<br/>\nSince your WIS is very low I suggest dropping ESF: Evocation. ESF: Conjuration is still useful due to the buffs it provides to Dragon Knight, and if you choose a planar race your\u00a0summon will be buffed even more. [<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://ns4ee.com/wiki/index.php/Dragon_Knight\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://ns4ee.com/wiki/index.php/Dragon_Knight</a>]<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a Druid you might also be interested in the changes to Elemental Shape. [<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://ns4ee.com/wiki/index.php/Elemental_Shape\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://ns4ee.com/wiki/index.php/Elemental_Shape</a>]<br/>\nSomething like a Rog13/Dru21/Figh6 could have Blinding Speed, Dragon Knight (with ESF: Conjuration for buffs), Epic Dodge, and focus in one of the Elemental Shape forms. However, due to the lack of epic feats you would need to drop AQ3 if you went with this build.</div>"

That limitation for Dragon Shape.... I don't understand. Is it illegal to have Dragon Shape at all or is it illegal only if you have a 3rd class?<br/>\n<br/>\nWe could squeeze 5 Monk levels, but that would also affect the effectiveness of the build. Too many restrictions. Perhaps you could try a variation of GDL's World Ender with fewer Druid levels. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>",
