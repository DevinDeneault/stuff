      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Let me introduce you to the most addictive single player module ever made for NWN, <strong>The Lord Of Terror</strong> will eat your nights, whisper in your ears and monopolize your thoughts with it's mystical atmosphere, continues action and brutal fights.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a reason why this module has not only be in the hall of fame for so many years but has the most downloads ever on NWN Vault with over 66 thousands! All these come from a single guy that wanted to play Diablo on his PC but in the 3D perspective of NWN. He searched time and again for such a module that would make him loose his sleep like the original game had but found only sub-par imitations that made no justice to the original. Finally one day he took the initiative and decided to learn the toolset and make his own module out of his love for the game. And what a masterpiece he created!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>The Lord Of Terror</strong> is unlike any other Diablo clone out there, it has all the original sound, the awesome voices, the creeping sound effects in the tombs the original had and more. The overall design tries to stay as close as possible to the original game featuring though many welcoming additions such as extra areas and bosses from the expansions and even Diablo 2. Even the secret cow level is implemented (after you finish the game). Claustrophobic catacombs filled with undead, demons, dragons, hell knights, lich lords and many other bizarre and terrifying creatures, that take you deeper and deeper to the source of evil till you reach the Hell itself and face the lieutenant of the dark lord first and then Diablo himself in an epic battle! During your course there you may or you may not uncover the secrets of the eternal war by the seraphim themselves and gain weapons of ultimate power, make no mistake - you will need them!<br/>\n<br/>\nDespite it's high magic (about the level of HoTU) setting, the module is very well balanced letting the features of the classes play an important role by themselves, and compined with its good level range (expect to reach level 28-30 by the end) make this module very good for testing of the Epic Builds here. Class features like Divine Might/ Shield - EWS - Evasion, are all very important for the module although as you may have already suspected it is more suitable for Paladin types than say - for Assassins. And here comes another feature of the module straight out from Diablo 2, many of the items themselves (and there are many) are based on their originals with all those awesome naming and powers in a seemingly endless supply. There are so many weapons that are worth to have (including awesome monk gloves) that the module has a distinguished re-playability based of that fact alone! The module also is open-ended not forcing you to take one route or the other giving you the choice to select each area you want to visit for yourself (in a logical manner). Excellent usage of true blackness where darkvision can be a real help is also worth noting. <strong>The Lord Of Terror</strong> is sufficiently long, expect to spend more than 30 hours of solid gameplay before you reach the end of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those classes that operate better with someone else nearby as a shield, the module offers the choice of four seperate henchmen, each with his own sub quest, that you can equip as you like (or as your pocket allows). For better visuals and more it uses the CEP as well (the 1.50 version) and many armors/weapons/monsters use that fully in order to deliver a superb experience. It can also be played as a multi player experience if you like, playing with your friends against the forces of darkness and trying to survive the intense combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore i give you the link to the actual module please make yourself a favour and use also those very important Haks for your NWN. Tony's AI and NWNQ. No NWN folder must be without them anymore, and if you want put the Undead Override there as well, makes a ton of difference, trust me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Lord Of Terror site --&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.tolitz.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwn.tolitz.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe Lord Of Terror module --&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/module/lord-terror-diablo-campaign\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://neverwintervault.org/project/nw ... o-campaign</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNWNCQ project --&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/hakpak/tileset/nwncq-project\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://neverwintervault.org/project/nw ... cq-project</a><br/>\n<br/>\nUndead override --&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/prefab/creature/undead-redux\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://neverwintervault.org/project/nw ... dead-redux</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHenchman Inventory &amp; Battle AI Mod --&gt;\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/hakpak/original-hakpak/henchman-inventory-battle-ai-mod\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://neverwintervault.org/project/nw ... tle-ai-mod</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy gaming!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">This probably will be the next module I play. If I get it to run properly on my WIN 10 machine, that is (in the comments on the vault people mention having issues with the module crashing on saving and stuff). I best start with modules with no or low role-playing and save the RP-heavy ones for later. Makes it easier to learn optimizing my characters, step by step.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I would guess social skills like Bluff or Persuade are not used here?<br/>\nWhile it might be useful to have things like Lore or UMD I would assume. Appraise probably won't be necessary when treasure availability is like in Diablo (where you often found the best stuff in the dungeons anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nTo sum up what I have read here: Will get you to level 28-30. Pally-types would make most sense, while feats like Divine Might, Divine Shield, EWS (as I get it, all weapon types are available), Evasion and Darkvision will be helpful... I will check for possible class combos and if the module runs properly on my computer, then come up with a request (for general guidance, *not* for a complete build) in the Requests section during the next days.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

No crashes or strange-looking tiles. (Using my old Platinum here, as they are still working on EE.)<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure what the Henchman AI does, but I had a short test run with a Druid build... while normally henchies or animal companions have a tendency to rush into battle head over heals and are suicidal, during that short test run I suddenly had to deal with a cowardly brown bear who ran away a bit more often than would have been necessary. And still didn't always do what I wanted... lol...<br/>\n<br/>\nLooks great, especially with NWNCQ and the Undead Redux.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is impossible, of course, to build an NWN module that is the same as Diablo. Totally different game engine and ruleset, won't work. But the author caught the atmosphere very well here.<br/>\nAnd even though I am not that far yet, I would agree with Valerfor that lawful stup... I mean LG types make the most sense here.<br/>\n<br/>\nAppraise is not used at all.<br/>\nPersuade can save you a bit of cash, and you might need it to get one of the Henchies when you alignment is not lawful (know that from my test run with the druid, with the other characters I am running through, I solo as much as I can), but probably is not really necessary.<br/>\nAlignment shifts are such a thing (what counts as good and what as lawful, I sometimes don't really get it), but when you are LG (and not NG or N and depend on it), it is easy to avoid shifts in the \"wrong\" direction (not sure if there are enough of these to actually change your alignment anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, I would say, The Lord of Terror definitely is recommendable!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

In some modules (including the OC) what I would consider to be chaotic, sometimes counts as evil, pffft (like when you spare the fallen ranger or the minotaur in chapter 2...) In other modules, including SoU, what I would consider to be good counts as lawful. And when trying to play chaotic good, I do not know which is worse, evil or lawful...<br/>\n<br/>\nBetter ask Valerfor. I am not that far into the module yet. The shifts towards lawful I got so far wouldn't be enough to change your alignment from neutral to lawful yet. There are a few occasions to save townsfolk from getting killed in the dungeons. When you manage to save them and tell them to flee and that you will handle it afterwards, you get +1 lawful and a couple XP, 250 when you are level 3, 200 when you are level 4 or something. I have no idea how many of them you will encounter later on (the only character so far who never failed to save them was yours, by the way).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I hadn't even considered going ranged (the second build) - that would make a nice change: iirc it's about 18 months since I was last a shootist. I notice you take Improved Sneak Attack as a Rogue bonus feat (at level 37), and I can't remember if that can be applied to ranged attacks. If not, would Slippery Mind be a reasonable idea, to help with the low Will save?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Personally, I'd go for the mental protection - at least you'll be able to use scrolls (assuming they're available) of restoration afterwards, or glug potions during combat. I suppose one could argue you could do the same with Clarity pots, but they've got a rubbish time limit for bigger fights. Anyway, that's just me. Of course, as you take more CoT levels your Will saves will improve dramatically (it does still irk me, though, that stun doesn't seem to count as a mental attack in NwN).<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless, glad you're having a (mostly) good time!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That is why I started over as a Rogue, but then i discover that they are set to require a specific key (which doesn't exist), and the explosions are scripted, so my Rogue couldn't disarm or even find the trap. That was annoying, but it was only in the Cathedral.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fight that stands out in my mind as the toughest was not the final one with Diablo, but the one not long before in the Armories of Hell.

She was accurate with her arrows from a distance but some enemies would always break off and go after her. Even with SL armour +4 she just gets owned by everything. I suppose I'll need to splash out for an amulet, cloak and rings too instead of being a miser. Also, I might be going in too soon but my fighter 9 WM 2 seems to easily crush everything in his path. <br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my G3125 using Tapatalk<br/>\n<br/>\n<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

And, again iirc, if you're at the highest level of difficulty, you'll lose all your gear and gold on transition. You can always crank it up after you arrive in Heliopolis.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere should be some more tips on useful stuff in the Sands of Fate thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
