      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hail, Mighty ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my NWN adaptation of Keldorn, the Inquisitor. In BG, an Inquisitor was a LG Paladin specialized in hunting down and killing Evil Mages, Necromancers to be more precise. There is no similar class in NWN to emulate that, but what tools would you need to hunt down mages? Well, first and foremost, a BIG SWORD and DevCrit (a mage's worst nightmare). Then, high saves, and then Smite Evil just to be sure. He's by no means a specialist in smiting Evil, but he is a VERY GOOD offensive meleer that will have no issues disposing of undeads. He will dish out damage like the best of them with his Greatsword buffed up with Deafening Clang, Divine Might, Divine Favor, and Holy Sword. his 26 STR + Paladin buffs will pretty much guarantee he will hit with his attacks, and his high saves will allow him to resist Necromancy spells like nobody. His buffed Fortitude save with Capped CHA is 47 against spells, 53 with capped CHA and CON. It's basically impossible to kill him with Necromancy spells unless he rolls a 1. This makes him a very efficient Inquisitor! May the Necromancers watch in horror, as Keldorn chops through their undead minions whilst resisting their spells, and then cleaves them in half with his Greatsword!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, because he specialized in hunting down mages, I thought it was a nice touch to give him Craft Wand. Why wouldn't he learn a couple of tricks from the enemies he studied so extensively, right?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said before, he's a very good OFFENSIVE character, best played in a party, where other characters can take the heat and he can do what he does best, which is kill things quickly. However, he can take the heat for a little while too, by switching to Sword / Board, turning on Expertise and Divine Shield. He's not the best tank, because his CON is really low, so CON-enhancing items are important, and an Empowered Endurance from a fellow Cleric wouldn't hurt either. I wouldn't recommend soloing with him, as all the great things he has going for him offensively, he lacks in defense, but he'll be a great addition to any party!<br/>\n<br/>\nLadies and Gentlemen,

I have trouble seeing him running around like speedy gonzalez punching people, so I went with the next best thing. DevCrit is a great way to deal with mages if they don't see you coming, as their Fort save will most likely be their worst and the DC is extremely hard to save against.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
