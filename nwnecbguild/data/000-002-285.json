It's very intuitive and compact; start it up, talk to the first NPC to set your level / rebuild the character, talk to the 2nd NPC to get your gear, attack the training dummy to get information on your average damage, and head into the arena to try it out vs either premade archetypes, like Barbarians / Wizards, or any monster.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd give it 10 / 10.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I use the Halls of Advanced Training Deluxe. It's way more complex than this one appears to be, but it has many nice features:<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can test your AB in several dummies that are in the training room: AC 10 dummy, AC 20 Dummy, AC 30 Dummy... AC 80 Dummy. That way you can figure out your chances of hitting a certain pre-set AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also archery targets doing the same thing. Then there is a thieves training room for skills, a monster arena for random monsters (however you can't pick any type of monster, they just randomly spawn), and finally a PvP arena, if you and a friend want to try out builds one vs the other. It's listed here in the guild I believe in the Builders Tools section.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
