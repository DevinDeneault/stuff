This training, combined with its extremely high Dexterity and the Weapon Finesse feat, have enabled him to achieve an AB of +38/+33/+28/+23 at level 40 for a mundane rapier. As if this were not high enough, he can use its arcane spells to further bolster its accuracy, using True Strike, Cat's Grace, and Greater Magic Weapon to achieve a minimum +64/+59/+54/+49 at level 40 with the same mundane rapier.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrequent and Powerful Criticals - The Versatile Kensai's long training and arcane capabilities have enabled it to precisely calculate strikes against its opponents. The rapier, a weapon with an already good critical line, 18-20/x2, becomes an amazingly powerful 13-20/x3 in the hands of the Versatile Kensai, who can cast the arcane spell Keen Edge to further increase the power of its rapier to 10-20/x3.<br/>\n<br/>\nRapid Attacks - Unlike many builds boasting level nine arcane spells, he receives four attacks a round, receiving a +16 BAB at level 20. He can easily Haste himself to receive a fifth attack at its highest attack bonus, meaning more hits, and by extension, more critical hits.<br/>\n<br/>\nMassive Damage - As if the frequency of critical hits wasn't enough, the Versatile Kensai can add significant damage to his Rapier. The Flame Weapon spell adds 1d4+10 fire damage to each blow, while Greater Magic Weapon adds an additional +5. The Bull's Strength spell will also contribute damage, bringing Strength to a minimum of 16 for +3 damage. All of these bonuses are multiplied in the case of critical hits, which will be plentiful for the Versatile Kensai.<br/>\n<br/>\nSneak Attacks - He can use either an Invisibility spell or his stealth skills to sneak up on opponents for 7d6 sneak attack damage. Alternately, he can distract an opponent with a summoned creature or his panther familiar while racking up damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nDefensive Capabilities<br/>\nTactical Movement - He will not provoke attacks of opportunity while moving around in combat, thanks to the Dodge, Mobility, and Spring Attack feats. This can come in handy when he needs to carry out a strategic retreat, possibly to come back later to wreak arcane retribution on his foes.<br/>\n<br/>\nExceptional Agility - The Versatile Kensai receives a large amount of AC thanks to his extreme Dexterity and training in the art of dodging. His 30 Dexterity will increase AC by ten points, his 40 ranks of Tumble will provide another eight points, and the Dodge feat provides another one point, for an unbuffed, unarmored AC of 29. Furthermore, the Uncanny Dodge feat ensures that he will never have to fear losing his Dodge AC bonus, which comprises a significant portion of the character's AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nArcane Defenses - Through his training as a wizard, the Versatile Kensai has developed the ability to cast a number of defensive spells to further boost his defensive abilities. He may cast Cat's Grace or Mage Armor to directly improve AC, and he may also cast Shadow Shield to provide AC and other useful defensive abilities. Premonition can provide damage reduction against especially persistent foes, while attackers will suffer damage from Mestil's Acid Sheath, Elemental Shield, and Death Armor. Bigby's Interposing Hand will make it very difficult for opponents to hit him. Finally, he may conceal itself entirely with a Greater Sanctuary spell, enabling him to cast buffs, retreat from combat for more preparation, or sit and watch as his Black Blade of Disaster does all the work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSelf-Concealment - The Versatile Kensai's familiarity with the arts of stealth have enabled him to hide from view very effectively. Thanks to the feats Self-Concealment I, II, and III, only 7 out of 10 incoming hits will even have a chance to strike him.<br/>\n<br/>\nImmunity to Smites - Staying true to his diverse heritage, the Versatile Kensai is a character of true neutral alignment, meaning he will never have to worry about being instantly killed from Smite by those pesky Blackguards, Champions of Torm, and Paladins. (Builder's note: Sorry, couldn't resist. It was too amusing to pass up. )<br/>\n<br/>\nDefense against Spells - Improved Evasion ensures that the he will take, at most, half damage against a spell allowing a Reflex save. Furthermore, with his high Spellcraft score, the Versatile Kensai receives +8 to all saves against spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nSkill Set<br/>\nI think his set of skills (at level 40) pretty much speaks for itself. He possesses an incredibly wide variety of skills, all of which enhance the character as a whole.<br/>\n<br/>\nArcane Capabilities<br/>\nAs a level 20 Illusionist Wizard, the Versatile Kensai has access to all spells 9th level and below. Buffing spells will particularly enhance the character's combat prowess, while offensive spells enable him to wreak havoc from a distance. Because of his relatively low number of Wizard levels (20) and Intelligence (20), he will ideally want to take offensive spells that do not allow a saving throw, such as Ice Storm, Isaac's Greater Missile Storm, Vampiric Touch, and the Bigby's Hand spells. Here is a list of possible spell memorizations that will make him ready for nearly any situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 0:\tRay of Frost x5<br/>\nLevel 1:\tExpeditious Retreat x1, Mage Armor x1, Magic Missile x2, Protection from Alignment x1, True Strike x2<br/>\nLevel 2:\tBull's Strength x1, Cat's Grace x1, Death Armor x2, Flame Weapon x1, Melf's Acid Arrow x1<br/>\nLevel 3:\tClarity x2, Dispel Magic x1, Greater Magic Weapon x1, Keen Edge x1, Vampiric Touch x1<br/>\nLevel 4:\tElemental Shield x2, Ice Storm x2, Lesser Spell Breach x1, Stoneskin x1<br/>\nLevel 5:\tBigby's Interposing Hand x2, Maximized Melf's Acid Arrow x2, Mestil's Acid Sheath x2<br/>\nLevel 6:\tBigby's Forceful Hand x2, Isaac's Greater Missile Storm x1, True Seeing x1, Maximized Vampiric Touch x1<br/>\nLevel 7:\tMaximized Ice Storm x2, Shadow Shield x2, Spell Mantle x1<br/>\nLevel 8:\tBigby's Clenched Fist x2, Greater Sanctuary x2, Premonition x1<br/>\nLevel 9:\tBlack Blade of Disaster x1, Greater Spell Mantle x1, Maximized Isaac's Greater Missile Storm x1, <br/>\nMordenkainen's Disjunction x2<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember, though, that you can use your stealth or the Greater Sanctuary spell to reconnoiter your opponents before a fight even takes place, enabling you to use your newly gathered intelligence to tailor your spell list for the occasion.<br/>\n<br/>\nEquipment Wishlist<br/>\nThe best weapon for the Versatile Kensai will be a high-quality magical rapier, ideally with high elemental damage so that he adds it to the tripled damage roll on a critical hit. The Versatile Kensai might also do well to carry a light, bludgeoning weapon such as a mace in case it finds itself confronted with undead or other monsters resistant to blades. When it comes to choosing armor, he will want to wear either Monk or Wizard robes, as these pieces of armor do not inhibit spell casting or agility. Isaac's Sequencer Robe is a fine choice, as are the Master Robes of the Old Order, which may require the Versatile Kensai to use Charisma-boosting items to increase his Use Magic Device skill. The Versatile Kensai will also want to acquire a permanent source of Haste, such as a Platinum Helm, and another source of AC, such as Boots of the Sun Soul. A Belt of Storm Giant Strength wouldn't hurt either.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I have had a look at this legacy build. It must be somewhat popular, since it has many views. And I can understand that, because the build promises a Weaponmaster, a Rogue and a Wizard with level 9 spells in one build. The Weaponmaster part secures 4 attacks per round and an extreme critical threat range with the Rapier. Rogue offers SA damage and skills galore. 20 wizard levels secure level 9 spells and the full table of spell slots. Spell DC and penetration on the other hand suffer from the limited number of caster levels, a relative feat starvation and a limited intelligence compared with specialist mages. There is also the thing that you are vulnerable to Greater dispelling.<br/>\nThe strength of the build is the versatility, you have a big tool kit and many ways to solve different challenges you come across.<br/>\nWhen I compare the build with current ECB standards, I see some flaws. So I have tried to revamp the build.<br/>\nAB is increased from +38 to +41<br/>\nI have given it Epic Dodge<br/>\nI take Expertise earlier<br/>\nI have reworked the skills more to my taste with better stealth and Epic trap handling.<br/>\nI removed the three Self concealment feats and changed intelligence from 20 to 19 to get room for Epic weapon focus, Epic prowess, Epic dodge (and its prereq - Defensive roll). You still have level 9 spells and the Improved invisibility spell will give you 50% concealment.<br/>\nI wish there was a way to take Weapon finesse earlier than level 15 without compromising the build.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Rogue(13), Illusionist(20), Weapon Master(7),\n\nDEX: 16 (30)\nWIS: 8\nCHA: 8\n\n02: Rogue(2): {Evasion}\n04: Illusionist(2): DEX+1, (DEX=17)\n06: Rogue(4): Mobility\n08: Rogue(6): DEX+1, (DEX=18)\n10: Rogue(8)\n12: Rogue(10): DEX+1, Whirlwind Attack, Improved Evasion, (DEX=19)\n14: Weapon Master(2)\n16: Weapon Master(4): DEX+1, (DEX=20)\n18: Rogue(11): Improved Critical: Rapier\n20: Weapon Master(7): DEX+1, (DEX=21)\n22: Illusionist(4)\n24: Illusionist(6): DEX+1, Epic Prowess, (DEX=22)\n26: Illusionist(8)\n28: Rogue(12): DEX+1, (DEX=24)\n30: Illusionist(11): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=25)\n32: Illusionist(13): DEX+1, (DEX=26)\n34: Illusionist(15): Great Intelligence III, (INT=19)\n36: Illusionist(17): DEX+1, Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=29)\n38: Illusionist(19)\n40: Illusionist(20): DEX+1, Empower Spell, (DEX=30)\nSkillpoints: 365\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9, Traps: +2\nAB (max, naked): 41 (melee), 37 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Wizard(9)\nConcentration 43(44), Craft Trap 15(19), Disable Trap 10(16), Hide 42(52), Intimidate 4(3), Move Silently 42(52), Open Lock 21(31), Search 38(42), Set Trap 33(45), Spellcraft 41(45), Tumble 40(50), UMD 36(35)\n01: Craft Trap(4), Disable Trap(4), Hide(4), Move Silently(4), Open Lock(4), Search(4), Set Trap(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(12), \n03: Concentration(6), Craft Trap(1), Spellcraft(2), Save(12), \n05: Craft Trap(1), Disable Trap(3), Hide(3), Move Silently(3), Open Lock(3), Search(3), Set Trap(1), Tumble(3), UMD(3), \n07: Craft Trap(1), Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(1), Search(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(5), \n09: Craft Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(1), Search(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(15), \n11: Craft Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(1), Search(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(25), \n13: Save(32), \n15: Save(44), \n17: Save(56), \n19: Save(48), \n21: Concentration(14), Spellcraft(15), Save(31), \n23: Save(43), \n25: Spellcraft(5), Save(50), \n27: Save(62), \n29: Concentration(6), \n31: Concentration(4), Save(3), \n33: Concentration(1), Save(15), \n35: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5), Save(22), \n37: Concentration(1), Save(34), \n39: Hide(11), Move Silently(11), Open Lock(6), Search(8), Set Trap(2), Tumble(10), UMD(5), </details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The problem then becomes the dip of 1BAB by having to take 1 more Rogue level and 2 more Illusionist pre-epic, as well as dropping to only 3APR. It would also have the knock-on effect of leaving only 1 Rogue for epic levels and a real messing up of the skills schedule.
