Created by uber-moderator Christian \"Torias\" Gillott, this character has been built to pound undead to dust. Her full plate heavy armour and tower shield make her suitably difficult to hit. On the other side of the equation, her longsword specialization and great cleave gives her mighty offensive capabilities. In addition, her prestige levels as a Champion of Torm, and her experience as a paladin, reward her with powerful divine buffs.<br/>\n<br/>\nReformatted by HipMaestro &amp; pals, 110912 <br/>\n<br/>\nPaladin(6), Fighter(8), Champion of Torm(26), Human, Lawful Good<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 14<br/>\nDEX: 10<br/>\nCON: 14<br/>\nWIS: 12<br/>\nINT: 10<br/>\nCHA: 16 (33)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Fighter(1): Luck of Heroes, Strong Soul, Weapon Focus: Longsword<br/>\n02: Fighter(2): Power Attack<br/>\n03: Paladin(1): Iron Will<br/>\n04: Paladin(2): CHA+1, (CHA=17)<br/>\n05: Fighter(3)<br/>\n06: Paladin(3): Divine Might<br/>\n07: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Longsword<br/>\n08: Champion of Torm(1): CHA+1, (CHA=18)<br/>\n09: Paladin(4): Divine Shield<br/>\n10: Champion of Torm(2): Cleave<br/>\n11: Champion of Torm(3)<br/>\n12: Paladin(5): CHA+1, Extra Turning, (CHA=19)<br/>\n13: Champion of Torm(4): Improved Critical: Longsword<br/>\n14: Champion of Torm(5)<br/>\n15: Champion of Torm(6): Extra Smiting, Great Cleave<br/>\n16: Champion of Torm(7): CHA+1, (CHA=20)<br/>\n17: Champion of Torm(8): Blind Fight<br/>\n18: Champion of Torm(9): Toughness<br/>\n19: Fighter(5)<br/>\n20: Paladin(6): CHA+1, (CHA=21)<br/>\n21: Champion of Torm(10): Great Charisma I, Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword, (CHA=22)<br/>\n22: Fighter(6): Epic Weapon Specialization: Longsword<br/>\n23: Fighter(7)<br/>\n24: Fighter(8): CHA+1, Great Charisma II, Armor Skin, (CHA=24)<br/>\n25: Champion of Torm(11)<br/>\n26: Champion of Torm(12)<br/>\n27: Champion of Torm(13): Great Charisma III, (CHA=25)<br/>\n28: Champion of Torm(14): CHA+1, Great Smite I, (CHA=26)<br/>\n29: Champion of Torm(15)<br/>\n30: Champion of Torm(16): Great Charisma IV, (CHA=27)<br/>\n31: Champion of Torm(17)<br/>\n32: Champion of Torm(18): CHA+1, Great Smite II, (CHA=28)<br/>\n33: Champion of Torm(19): Great Charisma V, (CHA=29)<br/>\n34: Champion of Torm(20)<br/>\n35: Champion of Torm(21)<br/>\n36: Champion of Torm(22): CHA+1, Great Charisma VI, Great Smite III, (CHA=31)<br/>\n37: Champion of Torm(23)<br/>\n38: Champion of Torm(24)<br/>\n39: Champion of Torm(25): Great Charisma VII, (CHA=32)<br/>\n40: Champion of Torm(26): CHA+1, Great Smite IV, (CHA=33)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 520<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 53/45/44<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Death: +1<br/>\nBAB: 30<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 35 (melee), 30 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 14/25<br/>\n<br/>\nSkillpoints: 129<br/>\nDiscipline 43(45), Heal 43(44), Persuade 23(34), Tumble 10(10)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Discipline(4), Heal(4), Save(4), <br/>\n02: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(5), <br/>\n03: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Persuade(6), <br/>\n04: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Persuade(1), <br/>\n05: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(1), <br/>\n06: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Persuade(2), <br/>\n07: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(1), <br/>\n08: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(2), <br/>\n09: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Persuade(3), <br/>\n10: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(1), <br/>\n11: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(2), <br/>\n12: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Persuade(3), <br/>\n13: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(1), <br/>\n14: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(2), <br/>\n15: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(3), <br/>\n16: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(4), <br/>\n17: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(5), <br/>\n18: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(6), <br/>\n19: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(7), <br/>\n20: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Persuade(8), <br/>\n21: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(1), <br/>\n22: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Tumble(1), <br/>\n23: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(1), <br/>\n24: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Tumble(1), <br/>\n25: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(1), <br/>\n26: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Tumble(1), <br/>\n27: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(1), <br/>\n28: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Tumble(1), <br/>\n29: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(1), <br/>\n30: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Tumble(1), <br/>\n31: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(1), <br/>\n32: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Tumble(1), <br/>\n33: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(1), <br/>\n34: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Tumble(1), <br/>\n35: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(1), <br/>\n36: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Tumble(1), <br/>\n37: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(1), <br/>\n38: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Tumble(1), <br/>\n39: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(1), <br/>\n40: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Tumble(1), <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Background, Analysis and Comments by Author</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nEquipment<br/>\nLongsword<br/>\nFull Plate Mail<br/>\nTower Shield <br/>\n<br/>\nSaving throws are most impressive as she is blessed with a +11 bonus from Divine Grace and a +13 bonus from Champion of Torm. She also receives +4 Will, +2 Fort, +1 Ref from feats. The Divine Warrior can memorize 2 first level paladin spells per day. They should ideally both be Bless Weapon to make undead very easy to deal with.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe astute player will notice, however, that the real power of the character is in her Divine feats. <br/>\nTurn Undead: She has 20 uses of Turn Undead per day. The Turn Undead power itself is actually weak for this character, but the Turn Undead charges can be used for either: <br/>\nDivine Might, +11 Divine Damage for 11 rounds<br/>\nDivine Shield, +11 Dodge AC for 11 rounds<br/>\n<br/>\nDivine Damage: This type of damage is rarely resisted by enemies, so it is helpful for dealing with enemies that have large amounts of damage reduction.<br/>\n<br/>\nDivine Shield: Divine Shield offers a huge AC boost and can be a life saver when swamped by enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\nSmite Evil: 3 times per day the character can use Smite Evil: +11 to attack, +160 to Damage -- save this combat power up to quickly take down major boss enemies. Evil dragons, demons, and devils will know true fear when confronted by the Divine Warrior.<br/>\n<br/>\nDivine Wrath: Once per day the character can use Divine Wrath: +9 to Attack, Damage, and Saving Throws for 11 Rounds. This, when combined with Divine Might and Divine Shield, makes the character an incredible combatant who can quickly and safely destroy an overwhelmingly large force of enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\nLay On Hands: Once per day, the character can use Lay On Hands to channel 11 * 32 = 352 points of Positive energy that can be used for healing (making it just as good as the Heal spell) or for attacking an undead creature that is susceptible to Positive energy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis character is even more powerful when she has access to magical equipment. The number one focus should be on items that boost Charisma. Every increase to the Charisma bonus results in improvements to: <br/>\nDivine Grace saving throw bonus<br/>\nDivine Might damage bonus and duration<br/>\nDivine Shield AC bonus and duration<br/>\nSmite Evil attack bonus<br/>\nDivine Wrath duration<br/>\nLay on Hands magnitude<br/>\nTurn Undead uses per day</div>"

      "content": "<div>This is a very interesting build to me. It's very similar to the type of builds I like to play (desesperately duty-burdened dogooders). However, I've got a question (not criticisms, since I can't make a powerful build to save my life), and an anotation.<br/>\n<br/>\n First of all, why 8 levels of fighter? If we kept the fighter levels at 4 we can still get WP and switching those 4 extra levels for CoT will increase the sacred defense and the divne wrath bonuses. What do those fighter levels give that you can't get with CoT, plus some extra bonuses?<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, having in mind playability from 1st level, I beleive that cleave and perhaps blind-fight are taken somewhat late. At lover levels I noticed that my characters get way less damage fighting mobs from cleave's extra attack, and depending on the module, you might want to take blind-fight earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\n I managed to get my own \"version2 on this build (I came with it myself before finding this one) that I might post on its own thread to get critiques and comments, if anyone is interested.</div>"

      "content": "<div>My only thought on why 8 levels of Fighter rather than 4 is that, while a pre-epic split of Pally 6/ Fighter 4/ CoT 10 would give you an extra bonus feat (Knockdown?), you'd lose 2 bonus feats in epic levels. One might be acceptable - because CHA finishes on an odd number (33) and thus might as well be 32, freeing up a shift of Armor Skin to fill the general feat left open by the loss of a Great Charisma - but it's hard to see what else could go. As it stands, Epic Prowess has already been sacrificed, so...<br/>\n<br/>\n On other issues, I'd be tempted to drop Great Cleave for Knockdown anyway. I find GC can be a thorough nuisance (though, of course, necessary if you're chasing Dev Crit), in that it can side-track you from attacking a mage/boss and end up wailing on an easy mob while the mage fries you. But others will like it, so a judgement call. Still, LoH, Strong Soul or Iron Will (the saves are astronomical is it is) could also be bounced for KD. And I agree about bringing Blind Fight and Cleave (much better than its big brother imho) in earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'd also lose 20 skill points from Heal and get another 10 cross-classed into Tumble for another 2 AC (then maybe take Epic Prowess instead of Armor Skin for +1AB and damage).<br/>\n<br/>\n And I'd certainly be interested in your take, Pelagius.<br/>\n<br/>\n On a different matter, you say you like the \"duty-burdened dogooders\" - have you ever played Aribeth's Redemption? It's specifically designed for such characters. There's a thread in the Modules sub-forum if you're interested, together with links to the downloads.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers</div>",

People were just beginning to explore the possibilities of the game engine back then.<br/>\n<br/>\n That being said, there is absolutely no reason why this build should not be a (fighter 4/ paladin 6/ cot 30) with an AB of 37 and great smite 7 along with the best divine wrath possible (+13/+13) and still absolutely amazing saves. Many of us could do that easily but i think since Pelagius is interested in the concept of a holy warrior, <span style=\"color:#0000CD\"><strong>he </strong></span>should do it and get the satisfaction out of it.

It will assume you spared Aribeth's life in the OC, and romance blossoms...Just make sure they're of Good alignment (LG is best, but NG and LN work too), male (no girl-on-girl action), human, elf or half-elf, and between levels 16 and 18 (assuming you want the best results). There's a<strong> lot </strong>of talking in the first mod, which is also linear in nature. The second is better, but it really wakes up in the third. Fortunately, the third is twice as long as the other two combined. It finishes at about level 27, so you could still continue with Sands of Fate as Valerfor suggests.</div></div>",

First, this build ends up with and odd number on CHA. Perhaps it would be better to dicth one GREAT CHA and get another GS instead. GS gets nothing from 33 CHA vs 32 CHA, and another GS would improve smiting by an order of magnitude.<br/>\n<br/>\n Second, this build appears on the game as premade character in several levels of development, go figure...</div>"
