From which the most similar builds are Grizzled_Dwarflord's Deathless Pariah, Mithdradates's Soldier of Death and\u00a0Deadmoney9951's Undead Spellsword.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSoldier of Death has Devastating Critical but only up to level 6 wizard spells.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nDeathless Pariah and Undead Spellsword get level 9 wizard spells, but don't get Devastating Critical because they focus on getting Automatic Still Spell III (which I feel uncomfortable with, with only 10-18 caster levels and an attribute modifier of 4-5). Undead Spellsword has 3 attacks per round.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this should be a unique contribution as far as I'm aware.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Environment:</strong><br/>\nI've assumed Time Stop and Mords scrolls are easily accessible in the environment you are playing in.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they aren't then swap the Wizard Bonus Feats (Great Intelligence and Empower Spell) around so that Great Intelligence is taken at Character Level 21 rather than Character\u00a0Level 38. That way both spells can be taken as free spells at Wizard Level ups.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Devastating Critical is disabled or nerfed in your environment, Overwhelming Critical and Devastating Critical can be swapped for either Two Great Strengths (for base Str 32 and base AB 41) or Epic Weapon Specialisation and Armor Skin (for additional +4 damage per hit and +2AC).<br/>\n<br/>\nCraft wand is very attractive in persistent worlds (where gold and exp loss from crafting magic is not an issue). It should be considered over Empower Spell, as given buffs are dispellable, a wand (ie an improved invisibility wand) most of them to be recast.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Acknowledgements:</strong><br/>\nAppreciate Valerfor's who suggested about 6 or so improvements to the build which I have incorporated<br/>\nAppreciate Mick Dagger's suggestion to include at least one rank in Disable Trap to ensure any traps that have been set can be retrieved.<br/>\nAppreciate\u00a0stephenratcliffe809's suggestions on Craft Wand and Improved Expertise<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>The Arcane Dwarven Dreadlord</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFighter(14), Wizard [Illusionist](10), Pale Master(16), Dwarf<br/>\n<br/>\nAny non-good (suggest either True Neutral or Lawful Neutral)<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 16 (30)<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 14<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 18 (19)<br/>\nCHA: 6<br/>\n<br/>\nDwarf: (Darkvision, Defensive Training vs. Giants, Stonecunning, Hardiness vs. Poison, Hardiness vs. Spells, Offensive Training vs. Goblinoids, Offensive Training vs. Orcs, Skill Affinity: Lore)<br/>\n01: Fighter(1): Power Attack, Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br/>\n02: Fighter(2): Blind Fight<br/>\n03: Fighter(3): Cleave<br/>\n04: Fighter(4): STR+1, Weapon Specialization: Greatsword, (STR=17)<br/>\n05: Fighter(5)<br/>\n06: Fighter(6): Toughness, Knockdown<br/>\n07: Fighter(7)<br/>\n08: Fighter(8): STR+1, Improved Critical: Greatsword, (STR=18)<br/>\n09: Fighter(9): Improved Knockdown<br/>\n10: Fighter(10): Disarm (or Expertise)<br/>\n11: Fighter(11)<br/>\n12: Illusionist(1): STR+1, Improved Disarm (or Improved Expertise), {Scribe Scroll}, (STR=19)<br/>\n13: Illusionist(2)<br/>\n14: Illusionist(3)<br/>\n15: Illusionist(4): Extend Spell<br/>\n16: Pale Master(1): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n17: Pale Master(2)<br/>\n18: Pale Master(3): Still Spell<br/>\n19: Pale Master(4)<br/>\n20: Fighter(12): STR+1, Great Cleave, (STR=21)<br/>\n21: Illusionist(5): Great Strength I, Empower Spell / Craft Wand, (STR=22)<br/>\n22: Pale Master(5)<br/>\n23: Pale Master(6)<br/>\n24: Pale Master(7): STR+1, Great Strength II, (STR=24)<br/>\n25: Pale Master(8)<br/>\n26: Pale Master(9)<br/>\n27: Pale Master(10): Overwhelming Critical: Greatsword<br/>\n28: Pale Master(11): STR+1, (STR=25)<br/>\n29: Pale Master(12)<br/>\n30: Fighter(13): Devastating Critical: Greatsword<br/>\n31: Pale Master(13): Epic Energy Resistance: Acid I<br/>\n32: Pale Master(14): STR+1, (STR=26)<br/>\n33: Pale Master(15): Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br/>\n34: Pale Master(16): Epic Spell: Epic Warding<br/>\n35: Illusionist(6)<br/>\n36: Illusionist(7): STR+1, Great Strength III, (STR=28)<br/>\n37: Illusionist(8)<br/>\n38: Illusionist(9)<br/>\n39: Illusionist(10): Great Strength IV, Great Intelligence I, (STR=29), (INT=19)<br/>\n40: Fighter(14): STR+1, Epic Prowess, (STR=30)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 419<br/>\nSkillpoints: 258<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 25/21/15<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +11, Poison: +2<br/>\nBAB: 26<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 40 (melee), 26 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 23/34<br/>\nSpell Casting: Wizard(9) 5 6 6 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 - 50 spells / day without items.

      "content": "<div>Expertise / Improved Expertise is a good feat in the early levels to reduce damage dealt to you, and tank damage for parties.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever later on I thought it would become irrelevant with Pale Master granting\u00a0 up to +10AC, crit immunity, sneak immunity, stun/hold/paralysis immunity, undispellable epic warding and level 9 wizard buffs (admittedly dispellable buffs like improved invisibility for 50% concealment,\u00a0 etc). This Fighter / Pale Master certainly can tank for sure, and expertise I thought would just be overkill. Even a sword and shield is overkill, he really needs a large two handed weapon to make the most of all of these defensive capabilities he gets from PM. I could have even made a variant of this guy to have 500 hp at the cost of 1AB, but I valued that 1AB more than the 80hp, its a 5% increased chance to hit and 5% increased chance to crit on threat rolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nImproved Disarm I just liked it in the tool kit better than Expertise for a large weapon wielder:<br/>\n- a situational AB buff against small (+4 -ie +20% chance to hit/crit) or tiny (+8 - ie +40% chance to hit/crit) weapon wielders, resisting the disarm attempt with discipline could be potentially beneficial to you.\u00a0<br/>\n- there are no penalties against medium weapon wielders, so any shield using opponent you can spam improved disarm until they lose their weapon.\u00a0<br/>\n- any disarmed non-monk opponents you can just wear a +1 soak 10 or 15 damage item, or a greater brawler belt (bludgeoning 20/-) and they will essentially do very little damage to you<br/>\n- only immunities to disarm are unarmed monks and creature weapons, unlike knockdown/improved knockdown<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want the extra AC in the early game to tank for your party you can also always go one handed and tower shield temporarily, but in the mid and late game that big two handed weapon is very attractive<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Edit:</strong>\u00a0I also forgot to mention a\u00a0disarmed\u00a0non-monk non creature weapon non-glove/bracer wearing opponents, if they are forced to fight you with their fists, will grant you free attacks of opportunity / round, which appear to be full AB when I check the combat log</div>"

It can be very useful, certainly. but if you're headed for a big nasty mage protected by a mob and you can't skip round to get to the focus of your ire, you can easily find yourself screwed, because Great Cleave kicks in and means you have to fight the mob first, whether you want to or not. And weirdly, the better you are at one-hit killing, the easier it is to get trapped in a Great Cleave cycle when mobbed. I'd like to see it as a selected option, rather than an automatic one - and you won't often hear that from me.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a word of warning...</div>",

At least the Abjurant Champion gets a degree of resistance to dispelling with the increased caster level progression which Pale Master doesn't provide (but provides a lot of other great defensive capabilities in exchange).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou probably know all this stuff given how fast you've progressed but I've put it out there just in case!<br/>\n<br/>\nValerfor taught me sometimes its good to bait out the dispel abilities from casters. One idea was a mildly buffed (ie resistance) heroic badger summon for example. Sometimes I've cast grease spells around the area with my casters as well to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\nScribing unused spells before resting could be handy too, in a persistent world.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAt level 21 you should have access to level 4 wizard spells by now!\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nA level 4 wizard spell such as improved invisibility is going to be very handy for a greatsword wielding 22 strength killer dwarf, and a few spare scrolls are going to be handy in combat if it gets dispelled.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking forward to when you have crit/sneak immunity, devastating critical with a Keen edged greatsword and epic warding!\u00a0</div>"
