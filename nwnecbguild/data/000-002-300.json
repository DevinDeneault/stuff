These classes are \"RDD\" and \"Shifter\" as they require a Level 21+ character of yours deleted and 30RPR.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso on the subject of Classes. To become a Arcane Archer from a Ranger you only require 6 levels of Ranger, you do not require any Wizard levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel Cap - Levels are Capped to 30, and their is a Minimum of level 3 to each class. Once you have taken 3 levels, you can dump single levels anywhere. E.G 3 Monk / 3 Cleric / 3 Rouge / 2 Monk / 1 Cleric / 8 Rouge/ 2 Monk. After you have taken the Minimul of 3 Levels, you can pick and mix as you feel not requiring a further 3 levels at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf any other Arelithians can add random knowledge to this, please do.<br/>\nIf any builders have any questions, please ask and I will try to answer.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
