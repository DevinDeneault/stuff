O_o Curse you, Rudd!) AND I killed the thing before the DC could get to a real threat.<br/>\n<br/>\nDespite this, I can say that Shifters cannot be Disarmed through the normal way - so in an environment where KD immunity is present, one does not need to invest in Discipline.\u00a0 On WoG, this is the case.</div>"
