And im not really good at this so far, and could use some help. I am playing at a server called Salvation on the enhanced edition. And i would love it if someone here could help me get something going until i learn more. I am looking for something that involves high crits with a two handed weapon, and fairly durable aswell, and a few nice buffs. Thanks in advance! :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

There's another part of me that - given the lack of alignment restrictions - wonders whether a Pally/Bard/CoT might not be a bad idea.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Yes, I have done such a build for another player Stag, it was the one with the picture of Solare of Astora but don't remember the thread's name...Anyway his server has a lot of modifications, I noticed the same thing for the divine feats &amp; some good things for the barbarians along with some nerfings for the dev. critical builds but there were also many spell changes as well, it definitely needs time to let all those sink-in. What i recommend in those cases is to play a weapon master if you want something with big damage that never gets nerfed. Of course, wm's tend to have very bad saves with very few exceptions so one has to decide what he wants from his character before I actually recommend such a build.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: Or you can play a dwarven (ftr/rog/cot) till you learn the ropes and having nothing to worry about...<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit 2: A melee cleric is another strong possibility of course. I think that also gets the vote of Empyre as well.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Speaking personally - and against conventional wisdom - I'm still not great with Weapon Masters. I know, I know, I'm a knuckle-runner who doesn't do anything much outside melee, so that should be my go-to type of build, but it just isn't. However, I do try to pay attention to you clever buggers, so I wonder, then...what about a Barb/WM/CoT? CoT should mitigate against the otherwise crappy saves, regardless of CHA, and also brings bonus feats by the truckload. Admittedly you won't have anything with plate armour, but, hey, \"come and have a go if you think you're hard enough\", seems a relatively reasonable attitude to take. You probably wouldn't need many levels of WM, so what about a Barb 15, WM 7, CoT 18? Does that make any sense?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Ninja'd\u00a0 by Velerfor - which probably says something in itself...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
