OK, so on my PW of choice, Blackstone Keep, I am going to set up two characters that can make potions, wands and scrolls of every kind. According to rumour, you can make almost anything with only two toons if you set them up right. Here's all the info I've managed to get about the \"supplier twins\". <br/>\n<br/>\n\"You need one 12bard/9wiz/21cleric (15 INT, 14 CHA, 20 WIS) and one paladin16/druid24 (full wis)\".<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's not sufficient information for me. I can't make two builds that are at least semi-playable and can make all scrolls/potions/wands out of that meagre recipe. Can anyone help? <br/>\nNote that if I can start both of them up this week, they don't actually need to be very playable, since I have 1.6 million XP in the XP-bank (outgoing feature, will be gone soon) and can more or less set these up right at lvl 36 or so.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That's why I was going for two toons. Too many toons makes the player confused.<br/>\nYou can make alignment changes. It costs you a bunch of xp if I remember correctly. Also, as long as you don't mix order/chaos, you can mix most stuff. You can't make bard/barbarian for instance.<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://blackstonekeep.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=226\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://blackstonekeep.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=226</a><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Maybe Paladin 14-15 / Monk 1-2 / Druid 24 for undispellable druid buffs dragon shape and a sky high Wis with Monk Wis AC.

I'll start the ball rolling with a few suggestions which I'm cool with people critiquing / praising. Assuming a change to Druid 18/Cleric 22/Monk 2 and comparing it to the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build225446.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">original</a>,<br/>\n<br/>\n- dump str to 8 and increase cons to 14 for more HP and a higher fortitude save in Cleric/Druid form. Str is going to be capped with Divine Power anyway once it is obtained. I find Str 8 is quite playable as a Druid and Thax's also commented on that previously.<br/>\n- monk at 7 for discipline/tumble dump, and playability over a longer period of the game as a shapeshifted druid/monk, (this is probably the biggest quality of life change) and keep monk at 39 for further skill dumps to nearly max out discipline and get tumble 40<br/>\n- keep Kail's target for DS at 33<br/>\n- OoJ is going to have close to two full spell books with druid and cleric spells so keeping penetration feats sounds great<br/>\n-\u00a0 spell focus / gsf / esf school with a sky high wisdom stat (buffed with Owl's Insight for +9 and Owl's Wisdom for 1d4+1) is tempting but I think Kail may not have included them for a reason.\u00a0<br/>\n- craft magic feats with lvl 9 cleric/druid spells are tempting, but I would say they are situational depending on the shopkeeper access players have.\u00a0<br/>\n- RE cleric domains - trickery domain I like. I think strength domain would be good for more casts of divine power. I can understand why Kail took Travel for access to the haste spell however. Would be tempting to take Brew Potion with Travel/Trickery domain for large numbers of potions of speed and invisibility whilst in dragon form.<br/>\n- zen archery could still be good combined with Divine Power and Favor for a bit more versatility<br/>\n- I wonder if Expertise and Armor Skin are necessary, as the Dragon's AC is going to be sky high anyway, and the enemy will probably need to roll a 1 just to hit you regardless<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
