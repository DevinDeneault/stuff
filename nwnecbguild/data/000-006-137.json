Why even the DwD levels?\u00a0 I just really wanted <em>Defensive Awareness II</em>, and once you get that at DwD5, one might as well go to DwD6 for 3/- DR.\u00a0 The last DwD level is just to max out Spot.\u00a0 Regarding skill point allocation: On Sorcerer Levels max Concentration and Spellcraft.\u00a0 On Defender Levels max Concentration and Spot.\u00a0 Drop your Tumble ranks (cross-classed) in between.\u00a0 It should be noted that this is not a hit-me-mage, though that is a style he can adopt if needed.\u00a0 I did want him to have some AC to mitigate criticals.\u00a0 There is no discipline in the build, but you would only need to be concerned about Knockdown, so make sure to find that immunity if available.\u00a0 Unlike other munchkin builds, paladin is taken early on to get those save bonuses up front.\u00a0 This build was tested in the Halls of Advanced Training, and I\u2019ll be giving him a whirl from the ground up out at me ole\u2019 stompin\u2019 grounds.\u00a0 Thoughts and comments are welcome.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div><em class=\"mention\">@webshaman1</em>\u00a0, Just to be clear to the lay reader/player, this is not a power build by any stretch of the imagination (I know you know this but others may not since you have a penchant for hyperbole).\u00a0 On the contrary, any pure sorc or near pure sorcer (see Exalted variations) will outgun this Dwarven Warlock, both in PvM and PvP.\u00a0 I think most variations of Mestil-type builds -- Half-Dead Juggernaut, Pale Emissary, etc -- are also superior to this one (but don't confuse superior with being able to beat him in PvP, for that is a different matter and one that I would be inclined to place money on this Warlock).\u00a0 So this is not a power build and there are plenty of sorcerer builds, or hit-me-mages, that are superior in PvM.\u00a0 This one is just a different, unique in some respects (there are very good reasons why one was never made or posted before), and illustrates that even after 20 years we can still come up with new concepts and variations.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it should also be noted that he is not immune to sneak attacks.\u00a0 Indeed, he can be sneaked just like anyone else -- from stealthed, HiPSed, knockdowned, immobilized, incapacitated, etc.\u00a0 He's only protected from flanking sneaks.\u00a0 His AC is not as high as I would like it either, so he is still susceptible to Critical hits.\u00a0 There really wasn't room for Auto Still.\u00a0 I had to discard Improved Expertise as well.\u00a0 For those environments where Craft Wand is nerfed then that's your throw-away feat to grab Improved Expertise.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo illustrate the sheer power of a sorcerer when Metamagic is used properly, here is an example of a spell set:<br/>\n6th: 8 Issacs Greater<br/>\n7th: 8 Silenced Isaacs Greater<br/>\n8th: 8 Empowered Isaacs Greater<br/>\n9th: 8 Maximized Isaacs Greater.<br/>\n...Just to illustrate pure fire power.\u00a0 This is why pure and near pure sorcerers are so deadly (and why Monks exist).<br/>\n<br/>\n<em class=\"mention\">@Orion2019</em>\u00a0, regarding the BAB and three attacks, that is just happenstance.\u00a0 I have no plans, nor should anyone really, on trying to capitalize on it.\u00a0 The AB is dreadfully low to be of any really value.\u00a0 The idea here is for the Warlock Messiah to use a Mage Staff for good properties, or any martial weapon really.\u00a0 But good catch on the ESF: Concentration.\u00a0 I did have it moved in one of my drafts but it must have regressed back when I was trying to fit in Auto Stills.\u00a0 It should be at Level 27 now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will have to correct you on one thing, though.\u00a0 This is not my first dwarven build since my return.\u00a0 Let me direct you to the following:\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-dragonwrought-dwarflord-fighter26-bard4-rdd10-t2355262.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dragonwrought Dwarflord</a><br/>\nand\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/runes-desolation-wizard-26-fighter-6-divine-champi-t2355263.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Runes &amp; Desolation</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<em class=\"mention\">@conlaoch</em>\u00a0, you are right about the PM vs Defensive Awareness.\u00a0 However, PM immunities trump this, IMO, in PvM.\u00a0 And no, Beamdog hasn't fixed PM spell progression.\u00a0 It's still on their list so I'm the under impression they want to try and make it a thing.</div>"

      "content": "<div>GDL,<br/>\nThis is a nice build. I might swap Stoneskin for Ice Storm since the build already has Epic Warding, Premonition, and Greater Stoneskin to provide DR. This would give it another no save damage dealer at a different spell level.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the updates to PM, I've looked at how it's currently implemented. Beamdog would have to change the engine or re-write all the spell scripts. The current exposed function that most default spell scripts use to determine caster level \"GetCasterLevel()\" simply returns the number of levels in the casting class and has many bugs. This is the reason PM levels aren't counted, and the reason you can't dispel the Bull's Strength from a character with 24 levels of Blackguard.<br/>\n<br/>\nRe-coding the engine side of the function may be easy or not depending on the data arrangement engine-side.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the big overall packages re-wrote all the scripts to make it more like PnP, but that completely re-balances the game (and makes summon spells useless at level 1 due to AI response).<br/>\nEdit: As <em class=\"mention\">@webshaman1</em>\u00a0pointed out, this references the PRC.<br/>\n<br/>\nFixing PM would open up so many character builds, though.</div>"

I haven't looked for an unofficial version.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're talking about the spell scripts, yes.
