Boo runs in them\u00a0\u00bb.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Go for the eyes Boo, GO FOR THE EYES!!\" : Boo is here to disable Minsc ennemis with his stunning claws (stunning fist DC 45 unbuffed, 51 capped and called shot).<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Ooo, squirrels, Boo! I know I saw them! Quick, throw nuts!\" : Boo is able to throw nuts for the squirrels (weapon focus\u00a0: sling and rapid shot, ranged AB of 40)<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Boo is small and evasive, and there is ever so much of Minsc to search\" : of course Boo is very small and evasive, so SD class to get HiPS + uncanny dodge was a natural choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoo is naturally wise, he's the source of the mental stability of Minsc, so he has a high wisdom (wisdom 20).<br/>\n<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>BOO, THE ONLY MINIATURE GIANT SPACE HAMSTER IN THE REALM</strong><br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>Race\u00a0</strong>: Miniature Giant Hamster (Halfling)<br/>\n<strong>Alignment\u00a0</strong>: Lawful Good<br/>\n<strong>Playabilty\u00a0</strong>: PVM, multiplayer. Boo is only playable with Minsc, the famous Hamster is really not suited for solo play.<br/>\nBoo and Minsc are made to fight together. Boo is made to paralyse the wizards by hitting their eyes while Minsc cut them with his blade.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk(20), Fighter(18), Shadowdancer(2)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nSTR: 12<br/>\nDEX: 18 (28)<br/>\nCON: 10<br/>\nWIS: 16 (20)<br/>\nINT: 10<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHamster (Halfling): (Fearless, Good Aim, Lucky, Skill Affinity: Listen, Skill Affinity: Move Silently, Small Stature)<br/>\n01: Monk(1): Blind Fight, {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}<br/>\n02: Monk(2): {Deflect Arrows}<br/>\n03: Fighter(1): Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus: Unarmed<br/>\n04: Fighter(2): DEX+1, Dodge, (DEX=19)<br/>\n05: Fighter(3)<br/>\n06: Fighter(4): Point Blank Shot, Weapon Specialization: Unarmed<br/>\n07: Monk(3)<br/>\n08: Monk(4): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br/>\n09: Monk(5): Weapon Focus: Sling<br/>\n10: Monk(6): {Knockdown, Improved Knockdown}<br/>\n11: Monk(7)<br/>\n12: Monk(8): DEX+1, Rapid Shot, (DEX=21)<br/>\n13: Monk(9): {Improved Evasion}<br/>\n14: Monk(10)<br/>\n15: Fighter(5): Mobility<br/>\n16: Fighter(6): DEX+1, Called Shot, (DEX=22)<br/>\n17: Monk(11)<br/>\n18: Fighter(7): Weapon Specialization: Sling<br/>\n19: Fighter(8): Improved Critical: Unarmed<br/>\n20: Fighter(9): DEX+1, (DEX=23)<br/>\n21: Fighter(10): Great Wisdom I, Epic Weapon Focus: Unarmed, (WIS=17)<br/>\n22: Shadowdancer(1): {Hide in Plain Sight}<br/>\n23: Shadowdancer(2): {Darkvision, Uncanny Dodge I}<br/>\n24: Fighter(11): DEX+1, Great Wisdom II, (DEX=24), (WIS=18)<br/>\n25: Fighter(12): Epic Weapon Specialization: Unarmed<br/>\n26: Monk(12)<br/>\n27: Monk(13): Great Wisdom III, (WIS=19)<br/>\n28: Monk(14): DEX+1, (DEX=25)<br/>\n29: Monk(15)<br/>\n30: Monk(16): Great Wisdom IV, (WIS=20)<br/>\n31: Fighter(13)<br/>\n32: Monk(17): DEX+1, (DEX=26)<br/>\n33: Fighter(14): Improved Stunning Fist I, Epic Prowess<br/>\n34: Monk(18)<br/>\n35: Monk(19)<br/>\n36: Fighter(15): DEX+1, Improved Stunning Fist II, (DEX=27)<br/>\n37: Fighter(16): Improved Stunning Fist III<br/>\n38: Fighter(17)<br/>\n39: Fighter(18): Improved Stunning Fist IV, Improved Stunning Fist V<br/>\n40: Monk(20): DEX+1, (DEX=28)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHitpoints: 356<br/>\nSkillpoints: 140<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 24/26/30<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Mind Effects: +2, Fear: +2<br/>\nBAB: 27<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 41 (melee), 40 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 37/37<br/>\nSpell Casting: <br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHide 43(56), Listen 14(25), Move Silently 43(58), Tumble 40(49)</div>\n<div align=\"left\">Damages : 2d6+7 (+13 capped) with claws, 1d4+1 with nuts.
