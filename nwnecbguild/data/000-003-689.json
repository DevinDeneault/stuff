So, I wanted to get some insight from the experts here (Who were also, hopefully familiar with the Arelith PW server changes on classes, feats and skills) on what would be the most \"Optimal\" route so to speak in building out this Paladin CoT character I have in mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I'll put the main split I was thinking of (Max level is 30):<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladin 17/CoT10/3 (Bard or Rogue)<br/>\n<br/>\nRequirements:<br/>\nMust be Human<br/>\nNeeds to use two-handed weapon (Greatsword)<br/>\nI'm avoiding use of WM intentionally- I want higher/consistent AB and Saves and not be as feat starved<br/>\nClasses must have 3 levels invested, minimum, and in order.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess my biggest question is, how could I expect play with such a build to look? Would it be more worthwhile to invest in more Paladin, or in more CoT? One of the main reasons I have the bard/rogue at the end is for some of the skill investments to be made in Tumble and Lore (Which have an effect on the scrolls you can use). I feel thematically, Bard may make more sense near the end of the training journey as the Paladin/CoT is out there experiencing crazier adventures. I could get away with dipping into Rogue instead though, as he finds himself in more 'exotic' locations requiring a nuanced touch from dungeoneering.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would I be trading for levels in Rogue, versus Bard? What would I be trading for more CoT, or more Paladin? Should I go as much as possible in on Strength, or should I invest more on Charisma? Should I have a minimum amount of Charisma? What would you say are the optimal feats to take for PvE (and worse case scenario, PvP against evil characters)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy end-game goal is, I'd like for him to be one charismatic son-of-a-gun leader who can dish damage to evil using his Greatsword while living to tell the tale.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny insight is super appreciated! Thanks all.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I will offer more detailed advice later today when I am a little less pressed for time but I can answer one quickly now.<br/>\n<br/>\nRogue nets you evasion and uncanny dodge.  Bard is generally used because it is the only class that offers: Tumble, Discipline, UMD and Spellcraft.  Although, the newish Specialist Class was added specifically to remove the requirement for everyone to bard dip (for RP reasons this was often a stretch but mechanically so powerful it was difficult to dismiss and still compete).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough Discipline is less important these days with the customisations to the effects, this is why most builds contain Bard or a discipline class and rogue.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this case, mechanically, the argument for rogue is massive.  Between Paladin and CoT saves, evasion becomes a core strength.  Likely a cornerstone of the build (evasion offers protection against the majority of single shot big damage things in the game).<br/>\n<br/>\nMeaning as a Paladin/CoT, there is no mechanical advantage to Bard over CoT (as a class dip, deeper investment in Bard offers something different).  RP, of course, is a different thing.  However, it is worth noting there is an NPC in the Radiant Heart who has an entire conversation around why Paladins make the best rogue types ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019ll offer more advice on Class composition later.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
