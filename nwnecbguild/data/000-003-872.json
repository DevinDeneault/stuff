      "content": "<div>Hi guys, im looking for help making a playable monk for my RP PW. I tried fooling a little around my self, but cant seems to really get it to stick.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>1) PvM or PvP -</strong> Well, this is a hard one cause, it needs to be able to PvM as it is the only way to level up. But at the same time, i would really like it to be able to take down others especially for the RP that i have planned.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>2) Level cap</strong> - Max level is 20, though this is hard to reach, normal reachable range is around 10-14.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>3) Race preference</strong> - Looking to do an Elf, but will \"settle\" for human should this be better.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>4) Class preference</strong> - I really want to do a stealth monk on my PW, seeing that they are so \"rough\" in their playstyle. On the PW where i play youre only allowed to take monk classes when youre monk. This creates an fun restriction to play with where you need to utilize both your feats and your skillpoints! <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>5) Melee preference</strong> - would like to go unarmed, but again, i would love to hear other idea?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>6) Range preference </strong>- DEX-,\u00a0 Zen-Archery, either really?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>10) Custom factors</strong> -\u00a0 here is the monk

So there is this restriction for classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the Fiery Fist ability, its an ability to gain basically the \"flame Weapon\" spell on your gloves/kama/sai etc. for the same number of turns as your wisdom score.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe PW, is very kind when it comes to having different gloves with attirbutes for a monk, though they may/can be hard to come by. Kama and monk weapons not much more then a +1/+3 kinda a things with a little added bonus now and then. its possible to get robes that has dmg reduction on them, or ac against specific dmg type, like blud, slash, piercing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\u00a0:)</div>"

      "content": "<div>Thanks Kyhe, that helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thought, if you're looking at a Dex build, would be to dual-wield kamas. You'd have the required number of feats to get Weapon Focus, Weapon Finesse, Ambidexterity, TWF, ITWF, Blind Fight and Imp Crit. Obviously, you'd have one more feat if you went human (as well as 23 more skill points) for something else - maybe Power Attack to boost damage, or Expertise to help AC (depending on what we go for in Int). That said, going with elf helps with Dex.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat that would mean is that while your damage per hit won't be as great as unarmed, you'll hit more frequently. The Monk attack schedule is not to be sniffed at.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, this would be very much a combat-focused build, so you'd prefer something more defensive, that can be explored.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

Just after a quick talk with some of the players, it seems that gloves are more \"enchanced\" to come by then Kamas on the server:</div>"

Every five ranks you place in the skill boosts AC by +1, it doesn't matter if you're Dex, Str, Cha, Wis, Int or Con based. And Monk has it as a class skill, so you'll be able to get +4AC from it. So, what have they done with Parry, because that sounds very different from the nerfed skill in vanilla?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

So realistically it's either Str, which would further limit your damage, or Wis, which would drop your AC and Will save by 1. I'm quite alright to drop the Str to 10 for an extra 20 hps and +1 to the Fort save if you'd prefer - it was merely personal preference on my part for a build that's concentrating on not getting hit at all (indeed, I'd thought about Dodge rather than Expertise as well for that extra +1AC vs current opponent). Your call, really.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if that's the case with Parry, then it's definitely a better option than Expertise here - you'd only lose the +2 saves vs spells. Or you could even take them both, so that when in Expertise mode you could have a naked pre-epic AC of 36, which is insane, frankly.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be really, really helpful to find out more about those extra feats, though. They could make a world of difference<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

Along with that you could have Blind Fight, Weapon Finesse, Toughness, Skills Focus in both Hide and MS, Toughness, Iron Will and Great Fort. And that's without buggering about with the opening/ending stats.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorth pursuing?</div>",

      "content": "<div>Thanks for the link, Mirnaia, it's a pretty comprehensive analysis. However, as with many comprehensive analyses, it does rather lose itself in the detail at times - sort of like saying, \"that's a tree\", \"that's a tree\", \"that's a tree\", \"that's a tree\", without recognizing that the whole thing's a forest. The prime example being that separating offence from defence, while all very laudable in statistical terms, misses the balance between the two that Monk achieves (or can achieve in a good build, anyway) better than any other class (imho).<br/>\n<br/>\nNevertheless, as you say, it's worth a read!</div>",
