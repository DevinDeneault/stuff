      "content": "<div>This is the finalized version of my Gloomstalker build, which I initially made here (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/gloomstalker-ranger-23-rogue-16-shadowdancer-1-t2355509.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">gloomstalker-ranger-23-rogue-16-shadowd ... 55509.html</a>). <br/>\n<br/>\nIt hurts to say, but as I was optimizing the build I realized that in most cases, Fighter is just a better class to pick than Ranger. Fighter allows for more feats (even after taking the Two-Weapon Fighting tree), specialization (generally more useful than Favored Enemies), and less levels to obtain what I wanted from Ranger, allowing for more Sneak Attack. <br/>\n<br/>\nI also changed the race from Elf to Human, allowing me to get more HP, more feats, more skill points, and avoid an XP penalty. I went with a medium race to help improve my Knockdown rolls, important for generating Sneak Attack on enemies with True Sight. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea behind this build was to create a stealthy character who could also stand toe-to-toe in a fight if needed. Inspiration was drawn from Assassin\u2019s Creed for the original concept. <br/>\n<br/>\nDual-Wielding is necessary in the build so that your initial flurry of attacks will have 3 when hasted. The Stealthy and Skill Focus feats can be changed, I just wanted to maximize my Hide and Move Silently skills. I\u2019d suggest Fortitude saves, but it could be fun to invest in Kukris or gain Specialization in a second weapon, or take Expertise!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis build also gets a free skill that can be changed based on the module being played. I take Pick Pocket because it is fun for me. Persuade is a good option here if a social skill is needed. Spellcraft is also a solid choice, though optimized use of Hide in Plain Sight, gear, and scrolls (via UMD) are usually good enough. You could choose to invest in Set Traps (I personally don\u2019t like trapping). You could also pick Spot\u2026it\u2019s up to you!<br/>\n<br/>\nGloomstalker (Fighter 20/Rogue 19/Shadowdancer 1)<br/>\nHuman, Any<br/>\nPvM (1-40), PvP (40,
