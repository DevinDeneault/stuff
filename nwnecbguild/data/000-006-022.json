He's always hiding in shadows to avoid the battle. However, he's really solid, strong and smart, with many combat tactics.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Build explanation :</span><br/>\n<br/>\nThe build is a balance between offense and defense. This toon has every feat a fighter needs, dev. crit, with the SD defensive skills and feats boosted by CT saves : improved evasion, slippery mind, defensive roll, HiPS usable in full armor.\u00a0<br/>\nHis 43 AB is really decent for an hybrid fighter, but he has some situationnal AB with improved disarm and stealth skills and HiPS (flanked or flat-flooded ennemis loose dodge and dex bonuses to AC).\u00a0<br/>\nWith uncanny dodge, he can fight in heavy or medium armor (with buffed dex) because he doesn't loose his dex bonus to AC while flat flooded etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgainst spellcasters, he has high saves, improved evasion and IKD.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">The Build :</span><br/>\n<br/>\nFighter(12), Champion of Torm(18), Shadowdancer(10), Human, True Neutral<br/>\n<br/>\nTested PvM 1 - 40<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 16 (28)<br/>\nDEX: 15<br/>\nCON: 14<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Fighter(1): Luck of Heroes, Power Attack, Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br/>\n02: Fighter(2): Cleave<br/>\n03: Fighter(3): Dodge<br/>\n04: Fighter(4): STR+1, Weapon Specialization: Greatsword, (STR=17)<br/>\n05: Fighter(5)<br/>\n06: Fighter(6): Toughness, Knockdown<br/>\n07: Fighter(7)<br/>\n08: Fighter(8): STR+1, Blind Fight, (STR=18)<br/>\n09: Champion of Torm(1): Iron Will<br/>\n10: Champion of Torm(2): Improved Critical: Greatsword<br/>\n11: Champion of Torm(3): {Smite Evil}<br/>\n12: Champion of Torm(4): STR+1, Stealthy, Improved Knockdown, (STR=19)<br/>\n13: Champion of Torm(5)<br/>\n14: Champion of Torm(6): Called Shot<br/>\n15: Champion of Torm(7): Disarm<br/>\n16: Champion of Torm(8): STR+1, Improved Disarm, (STR=20)<br/>\n17: Champion of Torm(9)<br/>\n18: Fighter(9): Great Cleave<br/>\n19: Fighter(10): Mobility<br/>\n20: Fighter(11): STR+1, (STR=21)<br/>\n21: Champion of Torm(10): Great Strength I, Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword, (STR=22)<br/>\n22: Shadowdancer(1): {Hide in Plain Sight}<br/>\n23: Fighter(12): Epic Weapon Specialization: Greatsword<br/>\n24: Shadowdancer(2): STR+1, Great Strength II, {Darkvision, Evasion, Uncanny Dodge I}, (STR=24)<br/>\n25: Shadowdancer(3)<br/>\n26: Shadowdancer(4)<br/>\n27: Shadowdancer(5): Overwhelming Critical: Greatsword, {Defensive Roll}<br/>\n28: Shadowdancer(6): STR+1, (STR=25)<br/>\n29: Shadowdancer(7): {Slippery Mind}<br/>\n30: Champion of Torm(11): Devastating Critical: Greatsword<br/>\n31: Champion of Torm(12)<br/>\n32: Shadowdancer(8): STR+1, (STR=26)<br/>\n33: Champion of Torm(13): Epic Skill Focus: Hide<br/>\n34: Champion of Torm(14): Armor Skin<br/>\n35: Champion of Torm(15)<br/>\n36: Champion of Torm(16): STR+1, Epic Skill Focus: Move Silently, (STR=27)<br/>\n37: Shadowdancer(9)<br/>\n38: Champion of Torm(17)<br/>\n39: Champion of Torm(18): Epic Will, Epic Prowess<br/>\n40: Shadowdancer(10): STR+1, {Improved Evasion}, (STR=28)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 500<br/>\nSkillpoints: 255<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 35/31/31<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +2, Traps: +2<br/>\nBAB: 30<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 43 (melee), 33 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (mundane items only): 29<br/>\nSpell Casting:\u00a0<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscipline 42(51), Heal 5(4), Hide 43(57), Listen 43(42), Move Silently 43(57), Spellcraft 8(10), Tumble 40(42)<br/>\n<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>\n01: Discipline(4), Save(16),\u00a0\n03: Discipline(1), Save(24),\u00a0\n05: Save(34),\u00a0\n07: Tumble(5), Save(34),\u00a0\n09: Save(44),\u00a0\n11: Save(54),\u00a0\n13: Move Silently(8), Save(48),\u00a0\n15: Save(58),\u00a0\n17: Hide(10), Save(48),\u00a0\n19: Save(58),\u00a0\n21: Save(68),\u00a0\n23: Discipline(5),\u00a0\n25: Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Spellcraft(3), Save(1),\u00a0\n27: Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(5), Save(6),\u00a0\n29: Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Save(18),\u00a0\n31: Discipline(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n33: Discipline(2), Spellcraft(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n35: Discipline(1), Save(7),\u00a0\n37: Hide(5), Listen(5), Move Silently(5), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n39: Discipline(1), Heal(4),\u00a0</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The only thing I might do differently in this case would be to drop Mobility and pick up Exotic Weapons and go with Kukris, dropping some of the feats for 2wf feats. That way, you can have a much higher DevCrit percentage, from 18-20, and at the same time more attacks per round. You really can't fight in Heavy Armor, as the penalty to the skill checks would make you easily detectable by any foes with an average spot or listen total, not to mention the bane of all Shadowdancers: True Sight. Also, if you're not going for Epic Dodge, why so many SD levels? Why not A LOT more Fighter levels for extra feats, or CoT levels for higher saves and some more feats? Uncanny Dodge is attained at SD 2, so you have 8 extra levels there that give you very little benefit, don't you think?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Indeed, I'm not as keen as I once was in the rules of NWN, having been pahing BG3 almost exclusively for a year. Nice catch! But with Kukris, and more Fighter levels, he could also get more Great Strengths, which would increase AB and damage, even if he doesn't get the 50% Damage. If you DevCrit them, they're dead, whether they have 2 HP or 1000.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
