      "content": "<div>Grandmaster of the Darksteel Fist<br/>\n<br/>\nDarksteel - has the unique property of absorbing all magical energy.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe had always known that he was different.\u00a0 Born into a poor family, already hopelessly overwhelmed with mouths to feed, his first memory was a reminder of this - as he was torn from suckling at his mother's teat, to only taste watered gruel from then on.\u00a0 That he survived his early childhood was a wonder.\u00a0 Sickly, scrawny, his nose always running, his belly distended from the starvation, only his eyes showed his difference.\u00a0 Burning with an inner fire that would not be denied.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 3 he was tested, as was the custom in his tribe, by the village Eldars.\u00a0 They recoiled in fear and loathing at what they discovered, and pronounced the child Cursed.\u00a0 It was not long thereafter that he was sold to Slavers, for a pence.\u00a0 It was better than death, thought the Eldars.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey would be proved wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis life as a sex slave was brutal, and without compassion.\u00a0 He was a thing to be used, in any way or fashion, and then forgotten.\u00a0 He could not recall all the faces, leering, sweating, swearing...it was a blur, those early memories.\u00a0 They got stuffed down deep...deep, into that crevice that would later spawn The Beast.\u00a0 But that was later...<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was passed from Owner to Owner, as they got tired of their new toy.\u00a0 Or perhaps it was the Curse, that caused this.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly the cruel Gods knew, and they laughed at his railments against his inescapable Fate.\u00a0 He stuffed it all down, into a crevice, away from himself, away from his sanity, for surely, he would become some maddened, sickened thing.\u00a0 In time, it coelesced, and took form, that space.\u00a0 It became The Beast.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was 8.\u00a0 Or so he believed.\u00a0 He was not sure, never having been schooled, never having access to any type of writings, let alone a calendar.\u00a0 But time can be measured in seasons, and as they passed into one another, from cold to warm, he marked his life accordingly.\u00a0 It had been a particularly trying evening, even for his standards.\u00a0 Still, the Master seemed exhausted from his exertions, and drugs, so he gathered his tattered limbs around himself in a fetal position, rocking back and forth, crooning a sing-song, almost silent scream at the existence that he had, his body burning agony.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Master did not stir.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a sort of shock, his attention wandered, his body afire with pain, but he was used to that by now.\u00a0 But the Master did not move, did not complain, did not NEED.\u00a0 He noticed, that the Master's body lie motionless.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe knew that curiousity was only a path to pain, and punishment, but something, something deep and dark within him, beckoned him to move closer. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Look\", it whispered caressingly, \"the Master moves not.\u00a0 Find out why\".<br/>\n<br/>\nHe ignored the promptings, having heard such much of his life.\u00a0 He knew it only led to more pain.\u00a0 But this time, the promptings became more persistent, more...pressing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSighing, ignoring the agony that movement caused in his young, tattered body, he moved slowly, silently to the Master's body.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was still.\u00a0 Deathly so.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe voice from within laughed.\u00a0 The whispering became insistent, more powerful.\u00a0 Hypnotic. It crooned.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Search the Master!\", it demanded.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe complied, finding a key that he knew would unlock his shackles, and various coins, and a few gems.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe stuck them in his thin shift, which he gathered around him, and fled, into the night, the way free.<br/>\n<br/>\nSweet, fresh air!\u00a0 The night caressed his skin, and his senses never felt so alive!\u00a0 Exhilerated, the very thought of freedom was like an elixir.\u00a0 His euphorium did not last long, for he was as a babe to the ways of the streets.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose who prey upon others know easy prey when they see it.\u00a0 Licking thick lips, some destitute men, hard times bonding them together, spied him.\u00a0 In an instant they were upon him, fist and boot quickly extinguishing any resistence.\u00a0 They left his broken and torn body in the gutter, food for the rats, gutteral laughs at his cries, grunts, and exclamations of glee at the found wealth.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey soon fell to infighting among themselves, him forgotten.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe remembered cold.\u00a0 Numbing, chilling to the bone, cold.\u00a0 Beyond shiver, beyond breath, beyond life.\u00a0 All consuming, he succumbed.\u00a0 But The Beast was not done, not yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Get UP!\u00a0 Crawl, wurm!\u00a0 CRAWL!\", it left no room for discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe complied.\u00a0 Why not?\u00a0 It did not matter, anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nStones, then some sort of wood met his exertions.\u00a0 He remembered no more.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe awoke to coarse fibres scraping against his flesh.\u00a0 He was no longer cold, and he hugged those rugged blankets to his boney frame, the minimal warmth like a susbstaining ember, binding him to life.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was too weary for tears, for any emotion whatsoever.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Man with the Strange Face sat on his bed. His face had no memorable marks, nothing remarkable about it at all.\u00a0 Totally mundane.\u00a0 Forgettable, it seemed to slide from memory.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe turned his attention to his bed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was an old, wooden sty, filled with old, rotten straw and covered in a roughly sewn patchwork blanket, that was little more than pieces of discarded, rotten cloth, sacks, and whatnot, that bed.\u00a0 But it was better than a stone floor.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Eat\", said the Man with a Strange Face, in a flat, emotionless voice.\u00a0 A watery gruel of some tasteless germ was spooned into his mouth.\u00a0 He swallowed it down, like it was ambrosia.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Tomorrow, begins your training.\u00a0 It will be hard.\u00a0 Prepare yourself, if you are to survive\", came that flat voice.\u00a0 It carried no amount of care, or hope, nor human feeling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe months that followed were a blur.\u00a0 If he had thought his previous existence was hard, he had been sorely mistaken!\u00a0 The exercises, the lessons, were excruciating, any fault, real or imaginined, was instantly and brutally penalized.\u00a0 His body was broken down, then rebuilt.\u00a0 His mind shattered, then remade.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe often whimpered, in the dark, when he though himself alone, and unwatched.\u00a0 But The Beast was always there, to mock him, to torment him.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"You will never be free, until you embrace ME!\", it shouted, in the corridors of his mind.\u00a0 But still he resisted, why he did not know, and how, it was a mystery even to himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe years went by, one into the next.\u00a0 He was 14.\u00a0 Or so he was told.\u00a0 And why should he doubt?\u00a0 He did not know.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis final test.\u00a0 He was to infiltrate a known brothel, and deal with a certain Patron.\u00a0 This Patron was known to have a hunger for young flesh, succulent male flesh.\u00a0 And though he had suffered long years of abuse, somehow his body was unblemished, his face angelic.\u00a0 The Curse.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was easy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Patron had tried to stop him, of course.\u00a0 Weaves of strange bands, colors, and strength were called into existence, but they just slid from his body as if he was oiled, impervious.\u00a0 His hands struck, and inside, something dark, something monstrous, echoed the violence, enjoyed it, relished it!<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Kill him!\", it roared!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe complied.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Patron lay crushed at his feet, his skull a lumpen mass of flesh, blood, bone, and brain.\u00a0 His bones had been broken, his limbs a grotesque effiggy. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nGuards rushed into the room, their faces echoed the horror in the recesses of his mind.\u00a0 What was he?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was instinct, or perhaps training, or perhaps something else, that guided his fists.\u00a0 On that night, the Brothel died!\u00a0 There was only one lone survivor, and HE disappeared, into the night, leaving such a carnage, such an orgy of violence behind, that the city buried it under propaganda and subterfuge.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, to this day, inhabitants whisper of the Night Terror. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was again moved.\u00a0 Brought aboard a vessel of woood, he would bear the trip of months in the hold, a slave always.\u00a0 He saw sunlight again, what he was sure was months later.\u00a0 Still, he was not sure about the passage of time.\u00a0 Only the darkness was his companion, whispering dark comfort in the otherwise stiffling still air of the hold.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe would later feverently wish he had remained there.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the tropical island (this he found out later...much later), the seasons were unknowable.\u00a0 Time passed, he knew this.\u00a0 But how much, he knew not.\u00a0 Day, nigh, day, night...how many?\u00a0 Too many to count.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Cowled One in Scarlet instructed him.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a cruel Master, one that drove him on, not only bodily, but also, for the first time, spiritually.\u00a0 The Cowled One could grasp his Soul, carve it, mark it, form it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPain unlike anything he had ever known (and he had thought to have known everything there was to know) he experienced.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey tortured his body, his mind, his very soul.\u00a0 They twisted him, carved him, formed him anew.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr so they thought.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn his anguish, his pain, he sought sanctuary.\u00a0 Only The Beast answered his tortured screams, his hoarse cries, caressed his sweating brow, crooned in his ear;<br/>\n<br/>\n\"I will always be by you\", it stated, as if it had all the time in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it did.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Accept me.\u00a0 Breathe me in\", it whispered.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe complied.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis final test came, conducted by The Cowled One in Scarlet.\u00a0 He was ready.\u00a0 He knew this.\u00a0 He simply knew.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe, and it, were one.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe could hear the silence. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nHe could see the darkness.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was a Force of One!<br/>\n<br/>\nHis fists were as weapons, rending steel as paper, his body stronger than the strongest armor, his will was The Beast reborn!<br/>\n<br/>\nHis soul, like diamond!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Cowled One in Scarlet realized the mistake, but alas, too late!\u00a0 Broken, that corpse in scarlet, more blood than fabric lay.\u00a0 Realized dreams had turned to nightmare.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey tried to stop him.\u00a0 Futilely<br/>\n<br/>\n.\u00a0 Bodies lie like stewn wheat, broken and torn.\u00a0 All of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was finally FREE!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd he would never again be bound!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk 38/Assassin 2<br/>\n<br/>\nElf<br/>\n<br/>\nStr 10<br/>\nInt 14<br/>\nWis 14<br/>\nDex 20<br/>\nCon\u00a0 6<br/>\nChr\u00a0 8<br/>\n<br/>\n1 Disarm<br/>\n2<br/>\n3<br/>\n4<br/>\n5<br/>\n6<br/>\n7<br/>\n8<br/>\n9<br/>\n10<br/>\n11<br/>\n12<br/>\n13<br/>\n14<br/>\n15<br/>\n16<br/>\n17<br/>\n18<br/>\n19<br/>\n20<br/>\n21<br/>\n22<br/>\n23<br/>\n24<br/>\n25<br/>\n26<br/>\n27<br/>\n28<br/>\n29<br/>\n30<br/>\n31<br/>\n32<br/>\n33<br/>\n34<br/>\n35<br/>\n36<br/>\n37<br/>\n38<br/>\n39<br/>\n40<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, now this is the feats I am looking at :<br/>\n<br/>\nBlind Fight<br/>\nCicle Kick<br/>\nImproved Disarm<br/>\nImproved Spell Resist X<br/>\nToughness<br/>\nWeapon Finesse<br/>\n<br/>\nAll points into Dex.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd these are the skills :<br/>\n<br/>\nConcentration max<br/>\nListen Max<br/>\nSet Trap<br/>\nTumble Max<br/>\nUMD<br/>\nHide<br/>\nMS<br/>\nSpot<br/>\nSearch<br/>\n<br/>\nI chose Assassin because there is no XP penalty, and 2 levels of Assassin because it then gets Uncanny Dodge, which allows retaining the Dex AC (not to mention UMD).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may be asking \"why Circle Kick?\u00a0 Isn't that broken?\" - well, BeamDog fixed it so that one would not target an opponent out of range and therefore stand there like a punch dummy.\u00a0 However, it does what it is supposed to do - attack another target WITHIN THE ROUND THAT IT ACTIVATES!<br/>\n<br/>\nThat would normally be a huge malus and no-no, but guess what?\u00a0 It allows one to do MULTIPLE DISARM ATTACKS ON DIFFERENT OPPONENTS in one round!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is a HUGE advantage if surrounded!<br/>\n<br/>\nThus, Improved Disarm in the build.<br/>\n<br/>\nIME (In my experience), I have never seen a PW that designs Monsters and Enemies to be resistent to Disarm - meaning that when disarmed, opponents rarely have the same AB with back-up weapons (if any besides bare fists).\u00a0 Of course, non-disarm environments will cause suffering here (as well as non-disarmable opponents).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, this build is to be tailored for WoG - I am not sure when, exactly, the Assassin levels should be taken.\u00a0 Discipline is not necessary, as GDL has so eloquently pointed out, in an environment with KD immunity and very little Disarm, it is just a skill sink that can better be used elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that I have tested A build of this on the offline Mod, and it is, to put it succinctly, nasty.<br/>\n<br/>\nHehe...<br/>\n<br/>\nHelp me make it truly fearsome!<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you liked the background story.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Your AB is already low even before the Disarm penalty is applied, so I would recommend dropping a couple of SR feats to get AB feats.<br/>\n61 SR gives immunity to level 40 casters without Spell Penetration feats, 67 SR gives immunity to level 40 casters with Epic Spell Penetration. At the very least you could drop a monk level and go for Monk37/Ass3 or Monk37/Ass2/SD1.<br/>\n<br/>\nBear in mind that I've never played WoG so this might be bad advice for that server.<br/>\nIf casters on WoG have very high caster levels then you might want to stick with Monk38/Ass2. 4 AB isn't too much of a loss if most mobs have low AC and low Discipline.</div>"

The towels for my head are still being steam-cleaned, but I'll get back to this one, which seems to give both a fair bit of scope and hardly any at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou'll probably have thought of it already, but just in case...Monk 35/ SD 5 gives you both HiPS and access to Epic Dodge. You would have to sacrifice UMD and sneak attack, though. And if you weren't looking for an elf, a hin Monk 30/ Rogue 5/ SD 5 would also work with some balancing of CON and STR. And I appreciate you want SR as high as you can get it. Aargh - nurse, those towels!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Ninja'd by Yunim, but I'll leave this anyway.
