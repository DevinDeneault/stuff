I suspect it could become very involved since you already mentioned subraces which pretty much falls into your own lap (the CBC tool was designed for only default races and classes). \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n You may find it more efficient all around to create a topic with the title of your server \"Tornado of Souls\" IIRC... in the PW subforum... and start listing. \u00a0Don't just paste all the text from the server rules. \u00a0Condense them down to character build-only factoids. \u00a0That way you need not keep repeating all the customizations (like the nerf on the DevCrit feat, for example) every time you request a build. \u00a0It's up to you how you handle it, though.</div></div>"

      "content": "<div>Then the best I can offer is the fact that Pal 26 yields an additional bonus feat with enough pally levels to cast virtually indispellable buffs (other than Mords of course). \u00a0That leaves 14 levels to toy with. \u00a0For a smiter build, CoT levels are very useful. Beyond that, there's not likely to be any astonishly innovative concepts that builders like Mith, Kail, Max, Grim &amp; Mick (just to name a few) have not previously covered for a pally build by their own industry and insight. \u00a0All those are accessible through the WoG search engine.<br/>\n<br/>\n Review what's already been devised by other epic builders, extract what you like from them and what you don't like (or what is not applicable to the server where you intend to play it) and piece together your own version with some background on why it is useful to you, then post it. \u00a0That's about all the effort you need to exert to get some viable suggestions on how to optimize a build concept.</div>"

If the server abounds in true seers HiPS loses most of its value. But WITHOUT the true seeing threat, and since you had indicated in a previous request that alignment is not an issue on your server, I would consider an assassin hybrid of some sort. \u00a0You won't find Pal/Asn builds with the search engine because they almost always build within legal character guidelines. \u00a0A combination of Divine Might and Death Attacks could be very troublesome for both PvM and PvP opponents, though the stun DC would not be all that effective. \u00a0But the sneaks will trigger from stealth and darkness.</div>"

Essentially I have replicated his build in toto pre-epic with some minor changes to better suit that item you want to build around.<br/>\n<br/>\n Paladin(27), Bard(3), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Human (start with LG)<br/>\n<br/>\n Ability bumps just like Mith (+8 STR, +2 CHA); final spread STR 14(32), DEX 8, CON 14(16), INT 14(16), WIS 14, CHA 14(20)<br/>\n w/capped abilities (should be no problemo on a high-magic server like yours) STR 44, CHA 32, CON 28 DEX 20, WIS 26, INT 28 in that order of preference.<br/>\n<br/>\n 1-20 Pal - WF, Blind Fight, KD (or Expertise), PA, Div Might/Shield, Imp Crit, Ext Spell (all just like Mith's)<br/>\n 21 Brd - EWF<br/>\n 22-31 RDD - (2)Grt STR, ESkF: Hide<br/>\n 32-38 Pal - ESkF: Mv Sil, AS, Grt CHA, Prowess<br/>\n 39,40 Brd - Grt CHA<br/>\n<br/>\n Skills:\u00a0Discipline 43(54), Hide 43(52), Lore 8(14), Move Silently 43(52), Perform 4(9), Spellcraft 42(45), Tumble 40(39), UMD 8(13)<br/>\n You can figure out the AB, AC &amp; saves ceilings when you test with your trainer, but saves will be very high, especially vs. spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n The reason for the slight variation in class spread is that you will only reach a level 3 song anyway. The few extra HPs &amp; buff duration is worth more than the few xtra skill points. You won't likely be trying to cast arcane with heavy/tower in tow so just stick with the song boosts.<br/>\n<br/>\n There are 3 alignment swaps. You can flop them around to need fewer if you like but with a manager available, what difference is there? To gain the most skill points, get to RDD 9 ASAP.\n<blockquote><div>\n This is the only server I have ever played on. It has been a long time since I played on the<br/>\n Original Campaign.

It's best to place a request here when you are completely aware of the limitations and enhancements that will have a direct impact on the build design. We are more than happy to help in any way we can but don't particularly like wasting time bouncing back and forth with each new \"discovery\" a requester publishes.<br/>\n<br/>\n In any event, good luck in your search for that elusive uber combo that will dominate.</div>"
