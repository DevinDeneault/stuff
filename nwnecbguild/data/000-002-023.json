      "content": "<div>Do summons worth the spell slot or feat slot in the case of epic summon at level 40 environment? I'm currently running a Wizard 35/ Rogue 3/ SD 2 character and he's wearing robe. Currently I'm playing near the end of interlude chapter of SoU module and even with my henchman and animal companion (panther), my spider summon (from summon creature IV) don't last long against horde of red slaads. I wonder if this is going to become a trend in the long run where summons will eventually become obsolete and at best summons become a distraction against enemies or at worst, a waste of spell slot in modules with level 40 like Sands of Fate? Or maybe this is the case where my tactics are not good enough against trash mobs as spellcaster. I'm trying to compile a list of summons that I think might be worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<table class=\"post_content_table\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Spell name</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Spell lvl</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Summon</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Pro</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Con</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Greater planar binding</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>Celestial Avenger</td>\n<td>High AC and AB</td>\n<td>Only available for Good alignment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Create undead</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>Spectre</td>\n<td>undead immunities to\u00a0critical hits,\u00a0death magic,\u00a0disease,\u00a0level drain,\u00a0ability drain,\u00a0mind-affecting\u00a0spells,\u00a0paralysis,\u00a0poison, and\u00a0sneak attack</td>\n<td>Frail with 18 AC and 55 HP; won't last long against hard hitting enemies and there are more optimized undead summons</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Summon creature IX</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>Elder air/fire/water elemental</td>\n<td>elemental immunities to\u00a0critical hits,\u00a0disease,\u00a0mind-affecting\u00a0spells,\u00a0paralysis,\u00a0poison, and\u00a0sneak attacks</td>\n<td>Can't control which elemental to summon so you might have to rest and recast the spell; might struggle against enemies with element damage immunity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Gate</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>Balor</td>\n<td>high AC and AB with moderate HP and bunch of fire spells like destruction, fireball, fire storm, implosion, and meteor swarm (limited use per day)</td>\n<td>Need to have a 'protection against element' spell line active when summoning to keep it friendly; might struggle against enemies with fire element immunity</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Black blade of disaster</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>Black blade of disaster</td>\n<td>Immune to damage with high AB and can instant kill any enemies that fails 17 DC fortitude saving throws</td>\n<td>Vulnerable to Dispel or Mordenkainen's disjunction spells; you can't take any actions that would undo your summon such as\u00a0attacking, casting a spell (including spells from items),\u00a0counterspelling,\u00a0disabling a trap,\u00a0flagging a trap,\u00a0picking a pocket, and\u00a0taunting</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Epic spell dragon knight</td>\n<td>Epic</td>\n<td>Red dragon</td>\n<td>Dragon\u00a0immunities\u00a0to\u00a0mind-affecting\u00a0spells,\u00a0paralysis\u00a0and\u00a0sneak attacks\u00a0plus immunity to\u00a0fear.
