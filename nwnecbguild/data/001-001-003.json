      "content": "<div>So.. I am playing Sands of Fate module and after exposing Merchant Guildmaster I killed him and went down the stairs. Merchants were not hostile, just guards. I killed the guards and went to stables. For some reason Ox'es in the pen were hostile to me and my henchman went and killed them. Now when I came back up merchants were hostile. Sadly I made a quick save. I dont have other saves and ENTIRE TOWN is hostile to me. I would like to fix this with console commands but Im not sure what to type.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n\u00a0Ideally - what should I type in console ? some suggestions I found in the google say that should I press \"P\" to see factions but I have nothing there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help will be welcome.</div>"
