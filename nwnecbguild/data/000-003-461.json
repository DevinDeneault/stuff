      "content": "<div>Greetings all : )  So heres the deal, I once played on a server that no longer exists and I tried out a build I saw on a forum that I dont think exists either. It was by far the best pvp pally build I'v come across and Iv tried searching the engines and see nothing similar. Here is what I remember: The level spread was 15 paladin/20 cot/5 harper scout. The build was dex based! Class 0 armor, used finess/rapier and tower shield, divine armor/wrath.The harper scout class may have been tweeked a bit making the buffs and saves worth it but not certain (I often wondered if going rogue or sd for defensive roll/epic dodge was a better option) Fully buffed I had 74 ab and ac was...I forgot but also over 70. I dont remember the final saves either but I do remember them being waaay higher than they needed to be. In fully buffed one on one duels he was unstopable! I only needed my lay on hands in open battle situations. I'd apreciate any help you can give me in reconstructing this build</div>"

      "content": "<div>Well, it's hard to do a build with these descriptions you gave because they're taking into account server items. But don't worry, not only can I give you such a build, I can probably improve on it too. CoT 20 gives you +1 to saves, so 18 levels is enough, which already frees up 2 levels for another class. As for HS, you get +1 DEX modifier from the two bonus feats, and to go for Epic Dodge, you'd need to lower your saves a lot, Paladin 17 CoT 10 Rogue 13 would do the trick, give you UMD and Epic Dodge. Let me get to work and I'll get back to you on this.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hey, <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is an Epic Dodging Pally CoT with full Taunt, VERY HIGH AC, OK AB, good damage output thanks to his buffs, etc. His saves are much lower than desired, but you can work around that if you drop Rogue and Epic Dodge for the aforementioned HS. Then he'd be Pally 17 CoT 18 HS 5, lose UMD, Improved Evasion, Defensive Roll and Epic Dodge, but have much higher saves and probably a higher CHA as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladin(17), Champion of Torm(10), Rogue(13), Human<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 14<br/>\nDEX: 16 (28)<br/>\nCON: 8<br/>\nWIS: 14<br/>\nINT: 10<br/>\nCHA: 14 (18)<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Paladin(1): Weapon Finesse, Power Attack<br/>\n02: Paladin(2): {Smite Evil}<br/>\n03: Paladin(3): Weapon Focus: Rapier<br/>\n04: Paladin(4): DEX+1, (DEX=17)<br/>\n05: Paladin(5)<br/>\n06: Paladin(6): Divine Shield<br/>\n07: Paladin(7)<br/>\n08: Paladin(8): DEX+1, (DEX=18)<br/>\n09: Paladin(9): Divine Might<br/>\n10: Paladin(10)<br/>\n11: Paladin(11)<br/>\n12: Paladin(12): DEX+1, Improved Critical: Rapier, (DEX=19)<br/>\n13: Paladin(13)<br/>\n14: Paladin(14)<br/>\n15: Paladin(15): Craft Wand<br/>\n16: Champion of Torm(1): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br/>\n17: Champion of Torm(2): Blind Fight<br/>\n18: Champion of Torm(3): Knockdown<br/>\n19: Champion of Torm(4): Cleave<br/>\n20: Champion of Torm(5): DEX+1, (DEX=21)<br/>\n21: Champion of Torm(6): Great Dexterity I, Armor Skin, (DEX=22)<br/>\n22: Rogue(1)<br/>\n23: Champion of Torm(7)<br/>\n24: Champion of Torm(8): DEX+1, Great Dexterity II, Epic Weapon Focus: Rapier, (DEX=24)<br/>\n25: Champion of Torm(9)<br/>\n26: Champion of Torm(10): Epic Prowess<br/>\n27: Rogue(2): Great Dexterity III, {Evasion}, (DEX=25)<br/>\n28: Rogue(3): DEX+1, {Uncanny Dodge I}, (DEX=26)<br/>\n29: Rogue(4)<br/>\n30: Rogue(5): Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=27)<br/>\n31: Rogue(6)<br/>\n32: Paladin(16): CHA+1, (CHA=15)<br/>\n33: Rogue(7): Great Charisma I, (CHA=16)<br/>\n34: Rogue(8)<br/>\n35: Rogue(9)<br/>\n36: Rogue(10): CHA+1, Great Charisma II, Improved Evasion, (CHA=18)<br/>\n37: Rogue(11)<br/>\n38: Rogue(12)<br/>\n39: Rogue(13): Epic Dodge, Defensive Roll<br/>\n40: Paladin(17): DEX+1, (DEX=28)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 308<br/>\nSkillpoints: 207<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 31/27/37<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Traps: +2<br/>\nBAB: 30<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 43 (melee), 40 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 29/32<br/>\nSpell Casting: Paladin(4)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nConcentration 41(40), Listen 42(44), Taunt 43(47), Tumble 40(49), UMD 41(45)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Taunt(4), Save(8), <br/>\n02: Taunt(1), Save(10), <br/>\n03: Taunt(1), Save(12), <br/>\n04: Taunt(1), Save(14), <br/>\n05: Taunt(1), Save(16), <br/>\n06: Taunt(1), Save(18), <br/>\n07: Taunt(1), Save(20), <br/>\n08: Taunt(1), Save(22), <br/>\n09: Taunt(1), Save(24), <br/>\n10: Taunt(1), Save(26), <br/>\n11: Taunt(1), Save(28), <br/>\n12: Taunt(1), Save(30), <br/>\n13: Taunt(1), Save(32), <br/>\n14: Taunt(1), Save(34), <br/>\n15: Taunt(1), Save(36), <br/>\n16: Save(39), <br/>\n17: Save(42), <br/>\n18: Save(45), <br/>\n19: Save(48), <br/>\n20: Save(51), <br/>\n21: Save(54), <br/>\n22: Listen(13), Tumble(25), UMD(25), <br/>\n23: Save(3), <br/>\n24: Save(6), <br/>\n25: Save(9), <br/>\n26: Save(12), <br/>\n27: Listen(11), Tumble(5), UMD(5), <br/>\n28: Listen(7), Tumble(1), UMD(1), <br/>\n29: Listen(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(6), <br/>\n30: Listen(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(12), <br/>\n31: Listen(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(18), <br/>\n32: Concentration(4), Taunt(17), <br/>\n33: Listen(2), Tumble(2), UMD(2), Save(3), <br/>\n34: Listen(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(9), <br/>\n35: Listen(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(15), <br/>\n36: Listen(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(21), <br/>\n37: Listen(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(27), <br/>\n38: Listen(1), UMD(1), Save(34), <br/>\n39: Listen(1), Save(42), <br/>\n40: Concentration(37), Taunt(8), <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some alterations that can be made in this build to make it better offensively while losing some defense. Firstly, you can forego of the CHA increases for DEX ones, giving you +2 to AB and AC, but lowering your saves by the same amount. Second, you can drop Rogue for Harper Scout, losing 2 pre-epic feats (probably Knockdown and Cleave, as the rest are requirements) for Iron Will and Alertness, you'd lose Epic Dodge, but then I'd recommend taking 2 more CoT levels pre-epic, since you can use that last general feat to take Epic Prowess, then I'd raise INT to 14 and lower DEX (since both Harper Scout Feats would be Great Dexes) and pick up Expertise and Improved Knockdown by reworking the feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladins have really good short-term buffs, such as Deafening Clang, Divine Favor and Prayer, and good long-term ones as well, like Bless, Aid, GMW, Bull's Strength, Aura of Glory, Eagle's Splendor and Death Ward. By taking Craft Wand, you can use wands to cast your long-term stuff, which will leave you more slots for shot-term stuff and increase your overall effectiveness. You can also get some Cat's Grace wands (if you can't cap DEX with items) to further increase your AB, as Rogue UMD will allow you to use them.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis AB with capped DEX will be:<br/>\n<br/>\n43 +6 DEX + 5 GMW +5 Divine Favor + 1 Bless +1 Aid +1 Prayer +6 Taunt + 5 Divine Wrath = 73. you may go Elf (you'd need to drop Concentration and a feat) for +2 free DEX, which will give you +1 AB (at the cost of HP which are already low), reduce CHA and pump DEX even further for another point of AB (at too high a cost IMO). You can get it up further +2 by swapping the 4 CHA increases for DEX ones, and by +1 by letting go of Epic Dodge for Harper Scout. So, 73 + 1 Elf +1 dumping CHA +2 Dropping CHA increases + 1 from going Harper Scout = 78 maximum possible AB or anywhere inbetween. Also, if the maximum enhancement of the weapons is higher than +5, you will gain the difference in AB as well, up to +2 ( +7 weapons - +5 GMW), after that, you'll have reached the cap, although Divine Wrath is a once-a-day ability that lasts very little, so most of the time you'll have +13 Magical increase on AB.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I am guessing you can figure out how to redo the version with HS instead of Rogue, otherwise PM me and I'll help you out.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Wow, thanks for the fast rely! And sorry it was a +5 server. Also re-reading my post I realized the epic dodge comment was unnesesary. it's been so long since I made an ED'er that I totally forgot about the heavey class requirments. I think what I was originally thinking was dropping the HS lvls for 2 sd or 3 rogue simply for uncanny dodge. would have a tumble/UMD skill dump if choosing rouge, have more pally or cot levels and would be retaining all that dex based ac. Do you thnink that trade off is worth it? Damn your epic dodge version of this build has me rethinking the the whole thing! it often comes down to that though, tweaking a build this way and that makeing it slightly better ofensivly or defensivly. So many choices!</div>"
