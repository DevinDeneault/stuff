      "content": "<div>Extremely feat-starved, including the lack of Blind Fight (which is extremely important, otherwise invisible things etc. are going to rip you apart, among other things). Also, your AB is well awful. A Pally Pure 40 with GSX has an AB 37, everything else in tact (playable, sure, as a PARTY MEMBER ONLY, heavy hitter on the bench, like in base ball, when the bases are loaded and/or up against a big EVIL mastermind/boss, whole team relies on the pally to get off the bench, one-shot kill the evil dude, fans cheer and other team goes home. Game over). But as against non-evil things, lousy (can't with a naked unbuffed AB 37 hit the broadside of a non-evil barn, great when buffed sure, but smite only works vs. the evil, and can't keep the \"big buffs\" up all day long either). By tossing WM in the mix, just makes it worse, I\"m afraid. No hard melee AB with far too few HPs. Trying to squeeze too much in, and doesn't do anything well in turn ... (A WM with a naked AB 36? er .... ).<br/>\n<br/>\nMelee MINIMUM is AB 40 and 400 HPs. This, to be a decent warrior (even then, only on an epic non-dispellable Paladin, who has the good Pally book for oh so much more). GSV is nice, but not enough when don't have other stuff like ie Str, decent unbuffed AB (again, not everything is evil, and dungeon crawls are drawn out, too; to put it another way: if you can't hit, you can't damage, right?l). Nice idea, but WM on a smite build doesn't do anything for you, I'm afraid. Weakens it, actually.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it comes to the Paladin class, decide: do you want to be a Smiter or militaristic melee warrior. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf going for the Smite, then go for IT ALL. Drop WM and grab Ftr, 4 of it, all Paladin goodies in tact--INCLUDING GS X--full pally book (non-dispellable), and a nice natural melee AB 40 with 400HPs so as to be NEITHER Smite NOR short-term buff dependent either. One-shot kill evil (GS X blows 'em up real good!), with the ability to do the drawn-out crawl, too (because not everything is evil, and not up against the \"big boss\" all day long either). Many go Cha-Str compromise for balance, watering everythig else down. I don't. Why, when you CAN have it all.  See, Sword of Tyr (Celestial Smiter), <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/sword-of-tyr-celestial-smiter-pal26-cot10-ftr4-t2294174.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sword-of-tyr-celestial-smiter-pal26-cot10-ftr4-t2294174.html</a> .<br/>\n<br/>\nAlternatively, drop the smite and FOCUS on WM. If so, no need to take Pal beyond your turn undeads so as to get your divine might and divine shield in order, as demonstrated by the Medieval Enforcer, Pal/WM who gives up the Smite in favour of Dev.Crit one-shot killing power. <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/medieval-enforcer-divine-blade-pal4-ftr14-wm22-t2294650.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">medieval-enforcer-divine-blade-pal4-ftr14-wm22-t2294650.html</a> . Gives up the \"good book\" but doesn't need it. ZERO need to buff this guy in fact, enjoying the PG/high melee AB, WM crit.factor (with dev.crit, and that one-shot kills all, not just evil, with plenty of STR based damage bolstered by FTR WS/EWS and DM (divine based damage) for crit.immune ie Pale Masters (players) and undead things, so not exactly crit. dependent (typical weakness of WM as a class) either. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf going WM, then go WM;  NO REASON to go so much Paladin in turn. (Yeah, I LOVE the Paladin class, always did, and so much more to them than the Smite angle alone). <br/>\n<br/>\nIf, on the other hand, it's \"balance\" you really want--as in, b/w STR and Cha (is there such a thing as balance? I am a power builder, enjoy playable power myself, and sure do get a nice balance when toss RDD in the mix, giving the STR so as to focus on CHA instead, among other things: like hard, melee AB, damage, skills and damage, while enjoying the divines (DM, DS) with the good pally book in tact, as demonstrated by the Knights (Paladins) of Bahamut (Divine Dragon), Dragon Knight, <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/dragon-knight-divine-dragon-pal26-rdd10-bard4-t2294234.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dragon-knight-divine-dragon-pal26-rdd10-bard4-t2294234.html</a> . Weakness the need for an alignment change (easy to do as it's on the law-chaos axis, and plenty of time in which to do so); however, if don't want an alignment change then go Sorc of it, as the Dragon Lance (Divine Dragon, Knight of Bahamut) does: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/dragon-lance-divine-dragon-pal29-rdd10-sorc1-t2294236.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dragon-lance-divine-dragon-pal29-rdd10-sorc1-t2294236.html</a> , with an option therein to also go GS V of it, while retaining real, hard melee AB and damage as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise, cool  idea, but doesn't work (for reasons you already point out and know, yes?). By tossing WM in just trying to chew too much (pun fully intended). <br/>\n<br/>\nSmite OR Crit ON ... <br/>\n<br/>\nTyr</div>"

      "content": "<div>You're welcome, D'Alessandro and no, you are not missing anything at all. WHen it comes to the Damage Adept, wel, loaded with \"cool\" RP factor but ...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trick on that one's the Scythe, farming implement (2-hander) with a lousy crit range, However, and what's going on there is to examine that \"faming tool\" in the hands of a WM--opens up the range a wee tad, gives it a super multiplier, and that's neat. However, even in the hands of a WM, it just don't fire that good. (When it does, look out, but w. an unbuffed AB 33, just not going to fire as you can't crit to begin with it you don't hit!  And now, it's your enemie's turn: with a Con 6 not to mention no BF, er ... Yeah, the Scythe looks cool, though. <br/>\n<br/>\nScimmy may not look as sexy but it does fire off, especially in the hands of a \"crit.crazy\" WM (can get it w/ keen to a crit range 10-20, with a /3 muliplier!). Damage is sexy, no? But for that damage crit or otherwise to occur, gotta have AB to land that hit. So, yes, as sexy as is that scythe as a concept, and it is as a concept, you're not missing anything (just no way to make an AB 33 shine, or lack of feats ... But yes, the WM multiplier on a scythe does otherwise look pretty neat). <br/>\n<br/>\nIf interested, hmmm, maybe make a big bad evil dude: say, FTR/WM/BG which won't be so feat-starved, and try that one with a scythe (for cool factor only; whip a scimmy for the mobs, pulling out the big weapon for the boss). I know there's LOADs of good BG/FTR builds on the Pulse/Search engine, but possibly just possibly might be able with WM (Fighter for feats) to do something with that, assuming it hasn't been done already (let's check the Pulse/search engine, shall we?  . I mean, notwithstanding what I said about \"balance\" above, we are here at the ECB \"balanced\" when it comes to good v. evil play, right? Lots of good guys around here and in the Pulse/Search engine, so time maybe to polish up and/or think up new ways of building some for the Dark side! <br/>\n<br/>\nTyr<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: <br/>\nPulse/Build Search found 3 BG/WM:  <br/>\nHeaven's Bane fighter 10 / weapon master 8 / blackguard 22 (human) by Edmonds10101 selects scythe, goes dev.crit, not smite route (STR 32, CHA 8 (no DM/DS or other use of CHA--i.e. Dark Blessing; AB 45).  The Black Knight fighter 8 / weapon master 7 / blackguard 25 (human) by Urgos Similar to Heavens Bane, but adds Epic Fiend and a bit more sneak in exchange for 2 STR (-1 AB/Dev.Crit DC/damage, but Epic Vrock and more sneak).<br/>\n Mistress of the Black Blade fighter 10 / blackguard 5 / weapon master 25 (human) by Cinnabar Din A high CHA build making use of Divine Feats (DM/DS) and Blessing, but not smiting. <br/>\n<br/>\nPulse/Build Search found 10 COT/WM, none of which take the smiting path, though one does take extra smiting as a feat (albeit no investment in CHA, dev.route intead).</div>"
