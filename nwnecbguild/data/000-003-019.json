      "content": "<div>Hey everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm looking to join up on the Arelith server. I played there a year ago, but stopped due to getting occupied with other things. I didnt even play long. I believe my character was level 7 or so.<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, I have always been horrible at building and preplanning builds for NWN. I just don't know where to begin when it comes to feats, skill allocation, when to level a certain class, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n I know I want to play a Halfling Rogue, with a bit of Monk for APR and bonus AC. I'll stick with dual wielding kamas. Possibly Fighter as well, though I'm open to an alternate third class. Really I have no intention of range weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\n Playstyle would be your run of the mill Rogue: Opening locks, stealthing around, removing traps, setting traps to assist in combat(if its even viable, but I do like the idea of setting my own traps.) <br/>\n<br/>\n The problem is, I have been told Discipline is a must have skill. None of the builds I've found contain it, so I'm not sure how to go about including it into a build. <br/>\n<br/>\n I don't plan on using any of the server's subraces. I will however select the +2 DEX gift and possibly the +2 INT gift. <br/>\n<br/>\n Arelith caps at level 30. <br/>\n<br/>\n Classes must be taken 3 consecutive times before leveling into a new class. <br/>\n<br/>\n EXAMPLE: Rogue would need to be at level 3 before being able to level into Monk; Monk at level 3 before leveling back into Rogue, or another class.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm just a newb when it comes to this. All of my googling and searching on builds has always brought me to these forums. So I figured, I'll come to the pros.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hello there MaaterOfNotAlot - and welcome!<br/>\n<br/>\n I've a couple of thoughts, a couple of questions and a couple of observations, if you don't mind?<br/>\n<br/>\n So, if you're going for dual-wielding kamas, you'll need the 2-weapon fighting, ambidexterity and improved 2-weapon fighting feats (assuming you'll be trying for the maximum number of attacks per round - always helpful with a Dexterity-based build, which I'm assuming this is). The Fighter class would be useful in that regard because of the sheer volume of bonus feats it attracts. However, you could get them for free if you take 9 levels of Ranger (as long as you stay in robes or light armour, which I guess you'd be doing anyway, else you'd lose the Monk speed and AC among other things) so my first thought would be a Rogue/ Monk/ Ranger build with a minimum of either 10 levels of Rogue and 9 of Monk and Ranger: or 13 of Rogue, 6 of Monk and 9 of Ranger. Either of these will also enable you to get Epic Dodge - the Dexer's best friend. A third way, which would keep a lot of bonus feats and help with your saves would be the Champion of Torm prestige class, but I may be muddying the waters here.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, what do you think about the Rogue/ Monk/ Ranger concept? We can start getting into the practicalities once we've sorted that out.<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and does the taking of 3 consecutive levels in one class apply throughout the build, or just the first time you take the class?<br/>\n<br/>\n Good to have you on board!<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers</div>",

      "content": "<div>Thanks for the response.<br/>\n<br/>\n The leveling system is just for the first time you take that class, not throughout the entire build. <br/>\n<br/>\n The ranger build does seem interesting. I even looked into adding ranger to mix things up a bit. Id probably go for the second option.<br/>\n<br/>\n And yes, I would be staying in light armor.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks<br/>\n<br/>\n EDIT: I should also add, I will primarily be PvE, though I would like to remain viable in PvP if the situation were ever to occur.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Thanks for the feedback. <br/>\n<br/>\n Stag, I do like the sound of Rogue, Ranger, Monk. Would be different. I do like Empyre's build too, but I think I'd like to run with your idea. Id probably go the 13 levels in rogue route.<br/>\n<br/>\n I could go either Halfling or Elf(wanting the +2 Dex, and will take the Dex gift for a total of +4.) I like the halfling more for the small stature, though elves do have their advantages. Whether or not I'll suffer an offhand penalty or not still isnt known though. Though I would like to be in groups the majority of my time, so if there is a penalty, hopefully it won't be a big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n Skills that I'm after are Disable/Set Trap, Open Locks, Hiding, Move Silently, Tumble(for ED), Search, UMD, Discipline(since everyone advises it should be maxed), and perhaps listen(or spot) and heal.  Obviously its a lot of skills, so I dont know how doable it would be. Heal could be dropped in favor of potions if need be.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Ah, thank you, but I suspect you're not going to like what comes next...<br/>\n<br/>\n I've been bouncing a few permutations around, and with only 30 levels to play with things all got a bit cramped, and in my best-case scenario either Monk 6 (Knockdown/ Improved Knockdown) came ridiculously late, or Ranger 9 did (Improved 2-Weapon Fighting), or Epic Dodge got delayed to level 30. So I looked at dropping Monk down to 3 levels. Then I realized I could get improvements by dropping both Monk and Ranger and replace them with CoT. Specifically, a halfling Rogue 16/ CoT 14 build.<br/>\n<br/>\n What CoT brings to the table (with 10 levels taken pre-epic) is enough bonus feats to cover the losses and bring more. Thus, rather than just the 7 general feats, you'd now have 5 more bonuses to play with, meaning you can take (in no particular order atm): Exotic Weapon Proficiency (so you can take kukris, for no AB penalty), Weapon Focus (in kukri, not surprisingly), Weapon Finesse, Ambidexterity, 2-weapon Fighting, Improved 2-weapon Fighting, Improved Critical (kukri), Blind Fighting, Knockdown, Improved Knockdown, Dodge and one other (maybe Toughness, Iron Will, Mobility or Stealthy). There's also a CoT bonus feat in epic levels, so you can get Epic Weapon Focus, Epic Dodge, Epic Prowess, Armor Skin and Great Dexterity 1. And, of course, with CoT you'll be getting a (much needed in some cases) boost of 7 to all your Saves.<br/>\n<br/>\n By only using the two classes, and going for 16 levels of Rogue, you can also get Crippling Strike as the Rogue bonus feat at that level.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for the skills, by my reckoning you'd have 279 to play with. That should be enough to max Tumble, Hide, Move Silently, UMD, Search, and either Spot or Listen. At the same time, there's still enough to get all you need in Disable and Set Trap, as well as Open Locks. After all that, you'll still have 24 points left. Now, there has been much debate over the years about whether Dex-based characters should bother with Discipline (there's a debate on that very subject in the General Discussions sub-forum here if you fancy a read). In this instance, I would be much more inclined to cross-class 12 points in Spellcraft (meaning, coincidentally, exactly the 24 points remaining) for a modified +3 save versus Spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n I think this would be an improvement, but it's your build, so over to you...<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT:</strong></em> Sorry, meant to mention, this was all based on starting stats (including taking gifts in Dex and Int) of STR 12, DEX 20, CON 14, WIS 10, INT 16, CHA 8, and finishing with 28 in DEX.</div>",

As I said, Empyre's build was initially the one I was looking at before even posting here.

Mainly I was looking at it for those nights when I'm forced to solo. <br/>\n<br/>\n If you don't mind, I'd like to see what you came up with as far as the progression goes.

      "content": "<div>I don't mind at all! Be aware of a couple of things, though, if you would. First, I ain't no expert myself - still more player than builder, and only been doing that for 2 and a half years - so I hope the great and good will knock me into line should I stray too far. Second, I've never played in a PW, let alone Arelith, so some of this will be guesswork, and you should correct any mistakes I make, please. Third (yes, I lied about it being a couple), I construct with pencil and paper rather than the clever stuff others use, so there may well be some human error to take into account.<br/>\n<br/>\n With those warnings, this is where I'm currently at with the build. (Oh, and equally, I input everything directly onto this site - no cut and paste for me, so until/unless you approve of where we're going, this isn't going to look anything like as professional as, for example, Empyre's above build.) At the moment I have Rogue 1-10 then CoT 1-10 pre-epic, then R11, CoT11, R12, CoT12, R13, Cot 13, R14, R15, CoT14, R16.<br/>\n<br/>\n The order of the feats is WProf:Exotic (L1), WFinesse (L3), WFocus:kukri (L6), Blind Fight (L9), Knockdown and 2-weapon Fighting (L12), Ambidexterity (L14), Imp Crit:kukri (L15), Imp Knockdown (L16), Dodge and Iron Will (L18), Imp 2-weapon Fighting (L20). Then in epic: Epic WFocus:kukri (L21), Armor Skin (L24), Epic Dodge (L27), Epic Prowess (L29), and Great Dex I (L30). For the Rogue bonus feats, I'd have Imp Evasion at L10, Def Roll at L25, and Crippling Strike at L30.<br/>\n<br/>\n I haven't done a full skills schedule yet, but for the skills themselves I'd go for: Disable Trap 21 (26), Hide 33 (46), Move Silently 33 (44), Open Lock 30 (39), Search 30 (33), Set Trap 14 (25), Spellcraft 12 (15), Spot 33 (33), Tumble 30 (39), UMD 31 (30). There are reasons for this distribution (and, please gods, let my trapping stuff be accurate) that we can go into later if need be.<br/>\n<br/>\n By my reckoning, your Saves would be: Fort 25, Will 21, Ref 36 - +3 vs Spells, +2 vs Fear-type spells. Your naked AC would be 22, +1 dodge against current enemy (clothed stuff I can do later). And, with a BAB of 22, the AB is a max of 36/31/26/21: dual-wielding kukris - 34/29/24/18 - 34/29.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, is this an idea we can flesh out, or...<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/11.gif\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT:</strong></em> Again, I should have mentioned that the stats I used were those cited in my previous post, and that all stat increases go to Dex.

You're right about exotic weapons, so I'd now put Dodge in at L1, keep WFinesse at 3, move exotic to 4, WFocus at 5, Blind Fight at 6 and KD at 9.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure how Discipline would help here (and as a traditional STR meleer it's my go-to skill), as the build is a stealthy bugger and a bit more of a support player - flanking and trapping - thus less likely to be the target of knockdowns and taunts. The Iron Will is predominantly taken because the thing a meleer is most likely to succumb to is a will save, so I always try to mitigate that if I can. Spot was taken so other sneaky bastards could be found and dealt with while scouting, thus taking some pressure off the tank.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut hey, you can tweak as you like!</div>",

Oh, and on that note, I have seen your Death Becomes Thee build, but I'm in no way qualified to comment on it, I'm afraid, having never even played an arcanist - so it's nothing personal!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as Open Locks is concerned, again, I was merely thinking in support role terms. If I was looking to invest in Disc, that would probably be where I'd look first. It's difficult sometimes when you don't know the environment.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Incidentally: having noted your avatar with delight, I've been playing me some BG of late - it's Xmas! - and Boo is an automatic companion choice - even if I do get landed with Minsc at the same time)</div>",

There are many times I have taken - and will continue to take - Minsc over and above potentially \"better\" comrades, purely because he's, well, Minsc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a shame in many respects than NwN doesn't have a comparable character.
