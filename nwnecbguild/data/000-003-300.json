Not sure if it can even be done because it seems like it would need a lot of feats...but that is why I am asking you the masters...lol.<br/>\n So I was thinking of a two-bladed/double axe\u00a0Dev-crit wanna be sneak. Like a Fighter/WM/With cheese (one lvl of SD or so) or a Halfling with duel-wield daggers (Sai which is\u00a0in the dagger family on this server can be forged to be like longswords pretty much but needs weapon Pro:Extoic)\u00a0with Dev-crit.(not sure if I can get enough base stat for good AB with weapon Fin. and have Dev crit?)<br/>\n For PvP, LvL40, I can top out 3 or 4 Stats on gear (+12), Dev-crit is nerfed so it does Double the crit damage instead of death. The server is called Sinfar. I would like as much AC as I can but have good Ab as well. I know its one or the other but...yeah. After +6 items and stat buffs most have at LEAST 55 or higher AB for the PvP games. But most have around 60 and some tanks have 70 AC. So I know theres a few options here but I am looking for a few set-ups. once again thank you for your guys time.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You can forge a +6 enchanment on any weapon...but there is a PP system they have for forgeing. It all depends on your weapon on how many enchants it can take. Some\u00a0weapons have a min. of two PP which only allows you\u00a0to put\u00a0+6, but then theres others\u00a0that can have +6,keen and a top\u00a0of 1d12 ele damage bonus. Like the Sai (in the dagger family) Can hold 7 PP which allow you to put +6 enhancement, keen, 1d12 massive crit, 1d4 ele damage, which is a lot. it all depends on the weapon. Sorry its prob a lot of looking into as far as the server has done...if you cant/dont want to take the time I understand. Thank you guys for all your time though. As far as AC goes, you can get +5 for armor,shield(if using one),necklace(nat)boots(dodge)and another item for the deflection.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Besides they usually just shift into construct or rak when they spot clerics. Anyhoo...</div>\n\n Sorry, campgod... but I have no time to research server tweaks. My time is full enough \"as is\".\u00a0 It's up to the requester to describe what changes will impact their build in the original post. Distill it down to basics.\u00a0 Revealing changes bit-by-bit can become frustrating and a waste of the guild's time. \u00a0But all this has been already documented in the Request Guidelines that I am sure you are well aware by this time.<br/>\n<br/>\n I would bag the idea of stealth altogether. What you ask is between a rock and a hard place. In order to qualify for DevCrit and develop a respectable DC, you must max STR with ability mod and items. That's far from a DEXer stealth build, neede to win detection checks. I'd consider a bard/rdd/wm except you'll run out of feat space to develop 2-wpn fighting enough. Along with the commitment to STR (am assuming this is in essence a high-damage build request since DevCrit does not kill), comes the typical power vs. agility conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\n So let's examine the +6 environment.<br/>\n<br/>\n Non-DEXer, non-buffed AC will be limited to 10 +1(DEX) + 14plate(armor AC) +6(nat AC from item)+6 (defl AC from item) +6 boots(dodge AC) +1 dodge(feat) +2(armor skin) +4 (tumble)= 50, 54 hasted (tower shield would add +9 in this environment). Means you'll be getting hit at least 10% of the time by any AB of 35 or better while only reciprocating with 5%... HALF. Going with Imp Expertise (AC 64 hasted) pretty much concedes you will be hitting only on 20's since even with a +6 weapon and +6 from capped STR for 45AB-ish typical WM would attack around 40AB or thereabouts with the minimum 2-wpn penalty in force. The good news is that every hit will be a crit. If what you say about 70AC is accurate, then logic dictates that scythe is the best 2-hand WoC (i.e. the highest crit multiplier weapon w/the highest base damage). At least you wouldn't need to soak the extra DEX into feats that will adversely affect your DC. But, regardless of the weapon, the goal is high-damage according to your DevCrit requirement.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, with all that declared, I recommend a ftr/WM5 battle cleric w/div shield to help even the AC battle a bit (and div might, if there's room). I'm figuring you'll be able to cap CHA as you stated. The full BAB free attack from DP is a bonus. No monk cheese? Monk will only net 4 tumble AC since the WIS AC (and monk AC with enough levels) is lost with armor along with the progression from non-monk weaponry. Throw the cheese in the dumpster.<br/>\n<br/>\n Div shield will provide +6 dodge minimum (if base CHA set to 10), excluding Emp Eagle buffs (+3 dodge &amp; div damage). I'd only consider WM7 if you are going against more pedestrian (i.e. 60-ish) ACs. In the case of unreachable ACs, crit range means zilch and that includes wasting of a feat on Imp Crit.<br/>\n<br/>\n So that is my recommendation. If you would like me to hash one out you can compare with others, fine. Some players are not comfortable with playing a self-buffer, so a lot depends on your own play style whether you will get the potential out of it or not. And maybe spells and feats have been toyed with to gimp a battle cleric. Dunno.<br/>\n<br/>\n Further questions in regards to possible server tweaks: What's the dodge cap... 20? \u00a0Do items floating around contain damage reduction and/or resistance to divine damage?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

On the other hand i noticed that almost all things have been nerfed somewhat, the armor bonusses from RDD/PM, the Monk's speed, the tumble AC from tumble ranks, shapeshifters, damage shields and so on, while a few others have been strengthen a bit. Namely Shadow Evade, Arrow of Death and most importantly Barbarian's Rage. So, if you take a build like my \"Dragon Prophet\" and optimize it for PvP (It's almost there anyway), it will have a ridiculous high AB &amp; damage whhile offfering still a high AC. What i want to ask you is, if you are set in that you want a dual-wielder wm/sneak, or you are open to different suggestions like the Barbarian.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take a look at this build by Mick also, he is offering a super-high AB, dual-wield Weapons Master here and although he doesnt have Dev Crit, i think he can kill so fast that you won't mind anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2353598/Kukri-Saint-Fighter-12-WM-25-Rogue-3#.U9g2PrH5dn8\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/23 ... 9g2PrH5dn8</a><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Cleave and Grt Cleave are just wasted feats in PvP (as well as WM's Mobility for that matter). You could make up that amount of DevCrit damage in many different ways, maintain a competive AC rating and the stealth (and/or HiPS) with lighter armor (or none, figuring there are +6 robes available) and still be able to use your WoC. Only problem I see are monks who will close ground much faster, perhaps too fast to detect in time. \u00a0But that's one of the by-products of your weapon preference.<br/>\n<br/>\n Has Greater Sanctuary been nerfed on your server (in regard to PvP)?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That's especially true if we consider the major nerfings at the duration of most spells that don't allow you to pre-buff and enter the fight.<br/>\n Now Mick's build has an AB of 51 or 49/49 while dual - wielding and it has already incorporated in it the feat for exotic weapons so you don't have to change anything at all. What does that mean for you? It means that you can substitute the kukris for <strong>any exotic weapon </strong>(including double-axe or dual--sword) and with the informtion you provided you can have a final (without buffing), constant AB while dual-wielding of 61/61 (49 +6 Str + 6 Ench). Assuming that the best tanks as you said have 70 AC there and most builds have somethinhg like 60-65 AC, with that AB and seven attacks/round you are going to <strong>literally carve them in pieces. </strong>Also you are part rogue and so you have umd, think smart. Keen can be added by a scroll, no need to incorporate that into a keen-able weapon, so you save enhancements for more damage bonuses. Don't bother with overwhelming critical crap, just add elemental bonuses into your weapons or something similar that gets multiplied by your weapon master enhanced precision. Heck, with this build's AB and with the aid of Dodge feat that it already has, you can activate Expertise all the time and still hit your opponents most of the time and hereby gain +6 AC Vs one opponent (that is all you need in a PvP fight).<br/>\n<br/>\n Hope i helped some.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I know for sure people throw out dis-spells like crazy on people cause of scrolls and potion users.</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">I'll try to hash a battle cleric out to compare with the other builds suggested so far. \u00a0Perspective is a good thing ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n The common number of cleric levels used in multiclass builds are typically: Clc 24 (dispel control w/full spell repertoire), Clc 15 (maximum self-buffing effects, not durations though w/up to level 8 spells) or 1 low-WIS non-caster level (or 2 for both feats) for divine AC &amp; damage boosts (as well as a few handy domain masteries) in CHA-focused builds. \u00a0Clc24 buffs are only dispelled by a Mord. \u00a0With each 1 Clc level less than 24 comes a 5% better chance to dispel via Greater Dispelling until reaching Clc 18 which becomes gradually able to be dispelled by a standard Dispel magic cast... and so on until anyone can dispel your buffs. Sounds like it's going to be important to include at least 24 levels on your server or you'll spend your time buffing instead of fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, if there are raw scrolls available for scribing, I would fit in Scribe Scroll. \u00a0With the Gtr Sanctuary nerf Valerfor described, I would be scribing a boatload of that spell on parchment. \u00a0You want to buff with complete autonomy whenever possible and break losing combat trends. \u00a0Entering any PvP area without pre-buffing is usually a recipe for failure anyway. \u00a0Never wander unbuffed. \u00a0And forget about standard Sanctuary. \u00a0It's too low level of a spell to win the Will save reliably, especially trying to run past mobs who seem to have an uncanny talent for rolling naturals. ;)</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
