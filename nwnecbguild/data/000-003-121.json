I recommend steering clear of this guy now.\u00a0 He's unstable thanks to some poor choices.

I've often dreamed the concept of a bardic monk and woke up cursing the realities of the game's alignment mechanics.\u00a0 But what can we do?\u00a0 Either play Dungeons and Dragons as designed or look for a game that only resembles it with rules more suited to our presonal bias.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
