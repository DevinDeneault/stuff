      "content": "<div>Hail, ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\n I come to you with the result of an idea I had when I received suggestions on another build thread of mine: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/versatile-tank-fighter-8-rogue-14-dwarven-defender-18-t2330731.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Versatile Tank</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\n This is a different take on this class combo, stopping Dwarven Defender levels at 5 for just Sneak Attack immunity and a couple of Defensive Stances a day for the harder fights. Epic Dodge is still at the core of the build, but more than that is the use and abuse of the Darkness spells, which is why I took 4 Rogue levels pre-epic. Hide and Move Silently are there, but not priorities, because you have Darkness. You thrive in Darkness, you welcome Darkness, you ARE Darkness. Hiding is for fools. All your spare gold should go to Darkness scrolls, and you curse the person who invented Ultravision and True Seeing. For those cheap cheaters, you have IKD.<br/>\n<br/>\n I was going to call this build \"Lone Sneaker in the Room\", because this is the idea. A High-AB-high-AC-Epic-Dodging-Sneak-Attacking-Strength-Reducing-Sneak-immune dwarf fighting machine. I dropped the focus on DR from the previous topic to focus on high DEX and Rogue goodies. I am very pleased with the result of this idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n Fighter(16), Dwarven Defender(5), Rogue(19), Dwarf<br/>\n<br/>\n Alignment: Any Lawful<br/>\n<br/>\n Playability: 1-40 PvM<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 10<br/>\n DEX: 18 (34)<br/>\n CON: 16<br/>\n WIS: 8<br/>\n INT: 14<br/>\n CHA: 6<br/>\n<br/>\n Dwarf: (Darkvision, Defensive Training vs. Giants, Stonecunning, Hardiness vs. Poison, Hardiness vs. Spells, Offensive Training vs. Goblinoids, Offensive Training vs. Orcs, Skill Affinity: Lore)<br/>\n 01: Rogue(1): Blind Fight<br/>\n 02: Fighter(1): Weapon Finesse<br/>\n 03: Fighter(2): Weapon Proficiency Exotic, Weapon Focus: Kukri<br/>\n 04: Fighter(3): DEX+1, (DEX=19)<br/>\n 05: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Kukri<br/>\n 06: Fighter(5): Toughness<br/>\n 07: Fighter(6): Dodge<br/>\n 08: Rogue(2): DEX+1, {Evasion}, (DEX=20)<br/>\n 09: Dwarven Defender(1): Improved Critical: Kukri, {Defensive Stance}<br/>\n 10: Dwarven Defender(2): {Defensive Awareness I}<br/>\n 11: Dwarven Defender(3)<br/>\n 12: Dwarven Defender(4): DEX+1, Knockdown, (DEX=21)<br/>\n 13: Dwarven Defender(5)<br/>\n 14: Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br/>\n 15: Fighter(7): Improved Knockdown<br/>\n 16: Fighter(8): DEX+1, Two-Weapon Fighting, (DEX=22)<br/>\n 17: Fighter(9)<br/>\n 18: Fighter(10): Ambidexterity, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br/>\n 19: Rogue(4)<br/>\n 20: Fighter(11): DEX+1, (DEX=23)<br/>\n 21: Rogue(5): Armor Skin<br/>\n 22: Rogue(6)<br/>\n 23: Rogue(7)<br/>\n 24: Rogue(8): DEX+1, Great Dexterity I, (DEX=25)<br/>\n 25: Rogue(9)<br/>\n 26: Rogue(10): Defensive Roll<br/>\n 27: Rogue(11): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=26)<br/>\n 28: Rogue(12): DEX+1, (DEX=27)<br/>\n 29: Rogue(13): Improved Evasion<br/>\n 30: Rogue(14): Great Dexterity III, (DEX=28)<br/>\n 31: Rogue(15)<br/>\n 32: Rogue(16): DEX+1, Epic Dodge, (DEX=29)<br/>\n 33: Fighter(12): Great Dexterity IV, Epic Weapon Focus: Kukri, (DEX=30)<br/>\n 34: Fighter(13)<br/>\n 35: Fighter(14): Epic Weapon Specialization: Kukri<br/>\n 36: Rogue(17): DEX+1, Great Dexterity V, (DEX=32)<br/>\n 37: Rogue(18)<br/>\n 38: Fighter(15)<br/>\n 39: Fighter(16): Great Dexterity VI, Epic Prowess, (DEX=33)<br/>\n 40: Rogue(19): DEX+1, Crippling Strike, (DEX=34)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 494<br/>\n Skillpoints: 304<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 25/17/30<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +2, Traps: +4, Poison: +2<br/>\n BAB: 29<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 45 (melee), 42 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 32/35<br/>\n Spell Casting:<br/>\n Alignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\n Disable Trap 42(46), Hide 43(55), Listen 43(42), Move Silently 43(55), Open Lock 1(13), Search 23(25), Set Trap 32(46), Tumble 40(52), UMD 37(35)<br/>\n<br/>\n No similar builds in the search engine. Many DD builds, but none with DD left just at 5 and Rogue. There's one with WM 7 and Fighter 28, another with Monk 12 and Ranger 23 and one with Ranger 29 and Fighter 6. None of them have Sneak Attack, which is part of the concept of being the only Sneaker in the room.<br/>\n<br/>\n Special thanks to Dante2377 for the comment that gave me the idea for this build.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, what do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div>"

(Speaking of, check <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://forum.bioware.com/topic/482397-duergar-dwarves/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">these ones</a> out!) The concept is really neat, I'll put this on my to-play list for down the road and make a note to give feedback. Very impressive stats, and the concept would just totally fit a Duergar basterd! :D<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n -JimDandy</div>"
