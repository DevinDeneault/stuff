      "content": "<div>This is my first build posted here (have read these forums and the old ones countless hours). I had a hiatus for a few years but i recently got my first child so i have more time at home, so playing is doable again, although in short bursts.<br/>\n<br/>\n I have not looked through the old forums for similar builds but i recall there was a severe lack of Str dualwielders in general there, so sorry if there are similar builds i have not mentioned.<br/>\n<br/>\n I REALLY wanted to do a diremace build for a long time, and as a result i have 10+ toons on WoG on low levels from my experiments (trial and error!!).<br/>\n<br/>\n It is probably not flawless, saves are horrible AB is ok.<br/>\n<br/>\n One could take knockdown on lvl 21 instead of GR Str 1, but that'd cost you 1 AB at those levels and if you managed to get there without knockback i'm sure it can wait, just a personal preferance.<br/>\n Knockdown could also be substituted for a Save Feat, or something of your own liking. i just really like smashing casters :)<br/>\n<br/>\n Fighter(8), Weapon Master(22),

      "content": "<div>A\u00a0 few things...<br/>\n<br/>\n First off, welcome back!\u00a0 Make sure to show your new addition, boy or girl, just how much fun NWN can be... complete with hands-on training! <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/11.gif\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n You DO have access to all the builds of the legacy archive courtesy of The_Krit's dedication to save them for posterity.\u00a0 Links and general How-to is found<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong> <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2354480/How-and-Where-to-Access-Legacy-ECB-Archives\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here.</a></strong></span><br/>\n<br/>\n Apparently, dwarves were popular back then but there is a racial mixture for that combo and some splits in the ballpark.\u00a0 The dead matches I found, as they were listed, were:<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>General purpose combat character</strong> fighter 8 / champion of Torm 10 / weapon master 22 (human) by<em> Torias</em><br/>\n<strong>Fighter 8 / CoT 10 / WM 22</strong> fighter 8 / champion of Torm 10 / weapon master 22 (human) by<em> oli84</em><br/>\n<strong>The Rock Warden</strong> fighter 8 / champion of Torm 10 / weapon master 22 (dwarf) by <em>Cinnabar Din</em><br/>\n<strong>Dwarven Master Slicer</strong> fighter 8 / champion of Torm 10 / weapon master 22 (dwarf) by <em>Kail Pendragon</em><br/>\n<br/>\n Now, as to your build...<br/>\n<br/>\n I automatically have deep abiding respect for any WM over 19 levels that doesn't use that lame epic toughness and you've managed to reach the 50 AB milestone. Through my own experience in most environments, I would swap build positions of Blind Fight &amp; KD only because KD is more universally useful against the toughest threats... mages. Yes, I realize just about every spawn on WoG uses stealth, but still feel that earlier KD makes things much easier.\u00a0 However, I perceive this as a personal comfort choice so do what makes the most sense to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n Since all you need to reach DevCrit is STR 25, I would postpone all those Grt STR bumps until you get Epic Prowess (get +1 AB in 1 level where Grt STR takes at least 3) and Armor Skin (especially with your low AC).\u00a0 You won't be getting the full large weapon bonus on each hand but still I don't think damage per round will be the key issue.\u00a0 This is a DevCrit build after all, so for crit immunes, an extra attack or 2 for a kill shouldn't matter.\u00a0 Your DC will be 41 plus any buffs, potentially 47 when capped which seems very good to me.\u00a0 These saves are decent for a pure fighter-type.\u00a0 Just watch out for Hold Person and other mind spells.\u00a0 They could ruin your day.<img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/2.gif\"/>\u00a0 With as few skills as you had to allocate, I think you've done about the best you could.<br/>\n<br/>\n Ummm... what's the value in CHA 12?\u00a0 You have no points to Persuade or other CHA-based skills.\u00a0 Seems a waste to me. I would have left it at 8, boost CON to 14 for 80 more HP and +2 Fort.\u00a0 If it is an RP consideration, state that clearly upfront so as not to confuse other builders about your decision-making.<br/>\n<br/>\n The #REF! notation is caused by Excel's inability to resolve a computation.\u00a0 In this case, you must have put zeros or some other unacceptbale character in those rows.\u00a0 The only way to fix it is to delete every cell value in those rows and enter each number manually...\u00a0 yes, again. As I mentioned, 0 (zero) is not a valid numeral, but null is.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, as to the clean-up to make this \"appear\" to look official...<br/>\n<br/>\n 1. Append the class split in the title just after the build's name.\u00a0 A hyphen or colon works or just use parentheses.<br/>\n 2. Test it!\u00a0 At least use a trainer like HoAT or PGCC and test combat each level (most trainers scale CR to match level).\u00a0 Even better, do some early-level testing on-line before finishing in a trainer. You will absolutely need this step to provide the next item...<br/>\n 3. Pros/Cons.\u00a0 Once you have some experience putting your conceptualization to the test, you should have enough information to assess the good, bad and ugly aspects.<br/>\n 4. PvM or PvP.\u00a0 If you've designed your build to duel a specific counter, identify it.\u00a0 There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all PvP build.\u00a0 Otherwise, it is PvM by default.<br/>\n 5. Alignment.\u00a0 In this case, CoT means \"Any non-evil\" so label that.\u00a0 If you have any personal preference, like to make it smite-proof or to fit some RP goal, in parenthesis identify that personal bias.<br/>\n 6. Finally... this build should have been posted in the Incomplete section until you have worked out the kinks (No worries! We all need to get started sometime.).\u00a0 What you will need to do now, once you have settled on a fully optimized tested version, is:\u00a0 Enclose the predecessor within {spoiler} {/spoiler} notations (but substitute brackets for curlies) and paste the full-fledged one to THE ORIGINAL POST before the spoiler.\u00a0 There are 2 reasons for this. 1) People looking to try a finished build should not have to wade through the entire thread searching to find the \"real\" build and 2) have pity on your admin who is making an effort to transpose build information into a search filter. He is one of those in the group of item 1) with limited time.<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>Welcome to the guild Macorog!<br/>\n<br/>\n Whilst your build is not original (apart from the weapon aspect), it certainly is powerful. The only (significant) weakness i can see in it, is that this is a party character more than solo. You need your buffs to operate at full strength but you don't have umd to do this your self, so you need your mage and cleric (or a rogue with the appropriate wands) to tackle the higher content. Devastating critical will help you a lot with this...<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, if you are thinking of taking advantage of WoG's rules about Champion of Torm builds (+1 rounds of divine wrath/ 5 CoT levels) by also having 12 Charisma to start, your cause is noble but i will question it's value...It is not a bad idea at all but personally, i would either take it to 14 Charisma base or sink it to 8 and put those much needed points to your Constitution. Also, is there a reason to delay your ews? Take your 8th Fighter/ 10th CoT level asap after you reach Epic and have it 5 lvls earlier. Lastly, at least in WoG, take armour skin before epic prowess, you need that AC, especially without full tumble skill.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Wow, thanks for the feedback. And the slap on the wrists Hip, all good.<br/>\n<br/>\n The Cha instead of Con is as Valefor noted to use Divine Wrath, while not super exciting with only 10 levels of CoT, +5 AB and +5 Divine Damage with 6/7 attacks can be a godsend on certain crit-immune bosstypes. i might opt to go for a +5 charisma cloak and maybe helmet/ring on that particular server, cloaks are one of the weakest slots if you ask me since most of their stuff is non-stackable with rings/amulets. Potentially granting up to 35 divine damage for 5 rounds with just those 2 slots.<br/>\n<br/>\n I do agree that Con is a very good option since hps are abit low. I have never been able to use Divine Wrath with any of my toons before though so i figured i'd give it a go here due to the amount of attacks..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n For EWS, actually no, my class knowledge is old and rusty and for some reason i recalleed needing lvl 10 WM for the Crit Feat. so you could bumpt it to 25 without any real difference it seems.<br/>\n<br/>\n I have a 22ish improved kukri master i saw on these forums actually. Its ok, but i kind of dislike the weapondamage and damagetype of kukris.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n And of course i will show the little one the joyfulness of NwN. Better than that Star Wars sci-fi it's mother plays.<br/>\n<br/>\n The child's name is: Thor Lemmy, i'll leave it at that and you will have to guess the gender :)</div>"
