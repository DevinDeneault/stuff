It also looks like Half-Orc could also work, although one will have less skill points and one loses all the awesome dwarven racial bonuses<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Rogue(16), Bard(2), Red Dragon Disciple(22), Dwarf\nSTR: 16 (26)\nCON: 18 (22)\nINT: 8 (10)\n\n01: Rogue(1): Blind Fight\n03: Rogue(3): Weapon Focus: Rapier, {Uncanny Dodge I}\n05: Rogue(5)\n07: Rogue(7)\n09: Rogue(9): Cleave\n11: Rogue(11)\n13: Red Dragon Disciple(1)\n15: Red Dragon Disciple(3): Improved Critical: Rapier\n17: Red Dragon Disciple(5)\n19: Red Dragon Disciple(7): (CON=22)\n21: Red Dragon Disciple(9): Epic Weapon Focus: Rapier, (INT=10)\n23: Rogue(12)\n25: Red Dragon Disciple(12)\n27: Rogue(13): Devastating Critical: Rapier, Defensive Roll\n29: Red Dragon Disciple(15)\n31: Red Dragon Disciple(17)\n33: Red Dragon Disciple(18): Great Dexterity I, Epic Damage Reduction III, (DEX=21)\n35: Red Dragon Disciple(20)\n37: Rogue(15)\n39: Red Dragon Disciple(22): Great Dexterity III, Epic Prowess, (DEX=24)\n\nSkillpoints: 180\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +3, Traps: +3, Poison: +2\nAB (max, naked): 36 (melee), 32 (ranged)\nSpell Casting:\u00a0\n\n\n01: Disable Trap(1), Listen(4), Lore(4), Open Lock(1), Search(4), Set Trap(1), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(5),\u00a0\n03: Listen(1), Lore(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(10),\u00a0\n05: Listen(1), Lore(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(16),\u00a0\n07: Listen(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(24),\u00a0\n09: Listen(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(32),\u00a0\n11: Listen(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(40),\u00a0\n13: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(24),\u00a0\n15: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(22),\u00a0\n17: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(20),\u00a0\n19: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(18),\u00a0\n21: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(16),\u00a0\n23: Listen(1), Tumble(10), UMD(11), Save(2),\u00a0\n25: Discipline(1), Listen(1),\u00a0\n27: Listen(1), Search(1), Tumble(5), Save(1),\u00a0\n29: Discipline(1), Listen(1),\u00a0\n31: Discipline(1), Listen(1),\u00a0\n33: Discipline(2), Save(2),\u00a0\n35: Discipline(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n37: Tumble(10), Save(3),\u00a0\n39: Discipline(1), Search(1),\u00a0</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hail GDL!<br/>\n<br/>\nI post a lot of unfinished build drafts, these are not yet ready for consideration for the level 40 section.<br/>\nThese are simply ideas, which I refine to a draft stage without play testing.\u00a0<br/>\nI put them up to share in the unfinished build section / build request section of the forum.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has several benefits:<br/>\n1. If there are obvious pitfalls then these will be commented on rapidly<br/>\n2. If there are weaknesses (for example, this triple epic feat build draft which stretches everything to the limit, only has a Base AB of 36) then I might ask if there is any way this weakness could be addressed, or is it just impossible within the NWN rules.<br/>\n3. If they are good ideas, then I use that feedback to prioritise developing one idea over another. If they are not so exciting ideas, then I might not prioritize developing it or even pause development on the idea.\u00a0<br/>\n4. It gives me time to develop some lore into the concept<br/>\n5. Others, may in fact play test the build before I do and give me suggestions. I posted a\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/viewtopic.php?p=17230#p17230\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lord of Gruumish - Fighter 20 / Bard / Pale Master</a>\u00a0build draft 5 months ago, trying to find a build in which the half-orc is 'the most optimal race'. <em class=\"mention\">@zg1k</em>\u00a0was kind enough not only to suggest comments, but to play test this build to 40 before I have even got around to it, and give me comments during the play testing as to what worked well. He told me it was quite straightforward to play. It is probably worthy of consideration to the level 40 section but I want to give it a bit more time and consideration before I submit it, unless others tell me such a build should be a priority<br/>\n6. If it is a good idea, it mulls around into my head until I scribe it down somewhere (usually in the CBC spreadsheet is the fastest method). After I scribe it down, if the numbers look good or there is something that I think might be of interest, then I post it up. Otherwise it continues to bug me until I do post it up, if you know what I mean? Like the double dev crit half-elf build then the double dev crit / EDR III half-elf build drafts. They looked so good I had to share em, develop the concept further, otherwise it would have just bugged me to no end.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's probably more, but I do appreciate the moderators and the guild community accomodating this it does get the ideas out of my brain to give it space for other ideas. Some months ago I struggled a bit figuring out what sort of cleric build I would like to play. I still have no idea. I went through devastating critical cleric build ideas, then double devastating critical cleric build ideas, then devastating critical pale master build ideas, then divine damage devastating critical zen arbalest ideas.... I think at some stage Mick Dagger just wrote: \"Please, feel free to post whatever cleric build you fancy Orion!\"<br/>\n<br/>\nI am play testing a few builds at once. I have been play testing through the Double Devastating EDR III Half-Elf Build Draft, the Mage-Fist Build Draft and the the HiPS Speed Caster Build Drafts so far this week. It will take a bit of time to get through all of them. The ideas are there to share to freely share at the minimum, and the conveyor belt is still chugging along slowly and surely.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I enjoy when you share your experience with playing the different builds. That also gives the guild a feedback on the advice\u00a0 given, confirming common knowledge or sometimes discovering something different.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
