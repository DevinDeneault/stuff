      "content": "<div>I started a new build for HotU on Friday. I'm going for flavour and playability\u00a0through the module. Initially, I forgot to include weapon finesse so I releveled him. I'm aiming for a murky, greasy, awful plague doctor character wielding a dagger. I had included some assassin levels for the\u00a0death\u00a0attack but I noticed it had only paralysed two enemies on the whole first level (dire spider and spider queen). I thought it was because they had low Con but then started looking up Assassin builds and found what appears to be a well thought out and researched build guide:\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/188666-neverwinter-nights/faqs/42969\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/188666 ... faqs/42969</a>:\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to this guide:<br/>\n<br/>\n\"After extensive testing (and the deaths of many harmless penguins), the<br/>\nfollowing 4 feats are regarded as mandatory for an effective Assassin build:<br/>\n<br/>\nBlooded \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0+2 Initiative, +2 Spot, 1st level only<br/>\nThug \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 +2 Initiative, +2 Persuade<br/>\nImproved Initiative \u00a0+4 Initiative<br/>\nSuperior Initiative \u00a0+8 Initiative, Improved Initiative, Epic Character\"<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm thinking about releveling and taking rogue instead of assassin. If I want Blooded I'd have to start anew anyway. I've never taken any of these feats for any build ever. It seems like a lot of feats to take in order to paralyse a single opponent on a sneak attack? Any insight on this?\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nRegards<br/>\nEltalstro</div>"

      "content": "<div>You did not manage to paralyse many enemies because you did not have many assassin levels. Two things matter for the DC of death attack, your intelligence &amp; the total number of your assassin levels. If you want to perform well as an assassin in HoTU or everywhere for that matter you need to have as many assassin levels as possible in your build. For example HoTU usually takes your character up to 27th level so you better have 13/14 assassin levels by then to be really effective. Initiative feats does not matter in the slightest, your best option is to hide/move silently and ambush your enemies with your death attack or simply quaff an invisibility potion &amp; do the same. You could also use the darkness/ultravision combo to achieve the same results.</div>"

First - you cant trigger paralyze if you attack creatures in darkness because they are don't count as flat-footed. <br/>\n<br/>\nSecond - initiative will help when you attack first time ever. From my playtest, I was able to paralyze one single target without hiding - just walk to it and attack. This work only when your enemies aren't scripted to attack you - when they simply walking around or standing. So, yes - initiative is crucial to the assassins because you always want to attack first.</div>"

      "content": "<div>I\"ve played my fair share of assassins and I'd like to say that this initiative argument is not a new one. I for one don't think investing valuable feats in initiative is the way to go. If one has \"enemies\" that don't go into combat stance when they see you...well I guess that's fine....I'd call them friendlies.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the time you'd be better suited in investing those feats elsewhere, and being good at hiding, getting invis, or corner hopping.</div>"

You can use Darkness on your enemies, which would work exactly as you described, but you can also use Darkness, say, just before an area where you will engage enemies, then go in hiding, attack, come back to the Darkness AoE, hide, and repeat, until everyone is paralyzed. Enemies outside Darkness won't see you, and will therefore disengage, allowing you to catch them flat-footed again.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>",
