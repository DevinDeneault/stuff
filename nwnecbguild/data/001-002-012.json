Not sure how active this forum still is but couldn't find a more appropriate place for this.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have a PW module collecting dust in your vault we could ressurect together, are currently working on a world and require a host/Dm or indeed would be interested in creating a team to get a project off the ground, then step forth! <br/>\n<br/>\nAsh<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

So, depending on what happens, we either need a backup tech guy or a new tech guy.<br/>\nWe're currently rebuilding Glorwing (which once was no 4 on Bioware's best PW list) on the new tech available. Most adventure areas are done, but we have a few wrinkles in the \"between mod and server\" area.<br/>\nIf you are interested, first check out <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.glorwing.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.glorwing.com</a> for some history, then <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.nwee.glorwing.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.nwee.glorwing.com</a> for some new information. If you're still interested let me know and I'll give you access to our Discord.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
