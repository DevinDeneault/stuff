      "content": "<div>Hello, ECBers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was just wondering, since the guild has been remade and we are again posting new fresh off the oven builds and our lvl 40 builds section already has two pages, if now wouldn't be the time to start thinking of a way to have our own search engine, customized for this guild's format with lvl 20, lvl 30 and lvl 40 builds as \"seach categories\" of some sort to make the search easier. I know nothing about how one would do such a thing, but I thought maybe if I raise the issue, we may find someone that can do it, eh?<br/>\n<br/>\nGotta go now, cya!</div>"

If bribery is in order, send me the bill (or my percentage) and I'll contribute .</div>"
