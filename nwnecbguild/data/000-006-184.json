      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">This is a dragonic build suited to my tastes, meaning it is a (great) smiter that is not a \"one trick pony\" but rather a well-balanced warrior that has access to all the feats he wants, has a natural 40 AB, Devastating critical, umd, Bard song and a really powerful \"Divine wrath\" that lasts for a whole fight. Great saving throws are a given with 22 CoT levels but we do not stay there only. The all-powerful RDD gives him immunities to fire, paralysis and sleep effects but also \"dragonic armour\" which means he has a top-notch AC as well. Weapon is illustrative-you can take anything you want, from a Scythe for the rare but almighty one-hit K.O or a bastard sword for more consistent critical smites. I took a Dwarven Waraxe cause i like it's base damage, it's a one-handed weapon and has really good criticals plus it's a rare sight. If you do not have use for devastating critical, then you will be even happier by taking two extra smites more, reaching great smite VIII, if you do that then shuffle the pre-epic feats a bit and drop \"great cleave\" for \"toughness\". With that much charisma you wil all the girls too, which is a nice change from all those short-legs you might be playing now ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:120%;line-height:normal\"><em><strong>The Devastating-Wrathful-Smiting Dragon...of Goodness!</strong></em></span><br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:120%;line-height:normal\"><em><strong>(Bard 8/ RDD 10/ COT 22)</strong></em></span><br/>\n<br/>\nRACE: Human<br/>\nALIGNMENT: TN (Smite Proof)<br/>\nPLAYABILITY: PvM 1 \u2013 40<br/>\n<br/>\nSTARTING/ ENDING STATS:<br/>\nSTR\u00a0 \u2013 18 (<strong>31</strong>)<br/>\nDEX\u00a0 \u2013 08<br/>\nCON \u2013 10 (<strong>12</strong>)<br/>\nINT \u00a0 \u2013 10 (<strong>12</strong>)<br/>\nWIS\u00a0 \u2013 08<br/>\nCHA \u2013 16 (<strong>25</strong>)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHit Points: 392<br/>\n<br/>\nSkill Points: 170\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscipline: 43 (53)<br/>\nTumble: 40 (39)<br/>\nSpellcraft: 39 (40)<br/>\nUMD: 28 (35)<br/>\nLore: 8 (17)<br/>\nPerform: 8 (15)<br/>\nPersuade: 4 (11)<br/>\n<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fort/Ref/Will): 34/ 31/ 32 \u2192 42/ 39/ 40 (saves Vs spells)<br/>\n<br/>\nNaked/ Armoured AC: 23/ 34 (Plate Armour &amp; Shield, 36 with Cat's Grace)<br/>\n<br/>\nBAB: 26 (Four Attacks)<br/>\n<br/>\nAB: +40/ +35/ +30/ +25 (Dwarven Waraxe)<br/>\n<br/>\nDMG: 1d10 +10/ 19-20 x3 (Dwarven Waraxe)<br/>\n<br/>\nDevastating Critical DC: 40 (46)<br/>\nSpellcasting: Bard 3rd Circle of Spells plus UMD<br/>\nBard Song 8/ Day: +2 Attack Bonus/ +2 Dmg/ +1 to all Saves/ +8 Hp's/ +1 to all Skills<br/>\nSmite Evil 3/ Day: +13 Attack Bonus/ +154 (462) Divine Dmg (Buffed Charisma)<br/>\nLay On Hands: 286 Positive Energy (Buffed Charisma)<br/>\nDivine Wrath: +9 Attack Bonus/ +9 Divine Dmg/ +9 to all Saves/ Dmg Reduction (15/ +3)<br/>\n<br/>\nLEVELING GUIDE:<br/>\n01) Bard (01): Blind Fight, Knockdown<br/>\n02) Bard (02):<br/>\n03) Bard (03): Exotic Weapons<br/>\n04) Bard (04): {CHA +1}<br/>\n05) Bard (05):<br/>\n06) Bard (06): WF: Dwarven Waraxe<br/>\n07) Red Dragon Disciple (01):<br/>\n08) Red Dragon Disciple (02): {CHA +1}<br/>\n09) Red Dragon Disciple (03): Heavy Armour<br/>\n10) Red Dragon Disciple (04):<br/>\n11) Red Dragon Disciple (05):<br/>\n12) Red Dragon Disciple (06): IC: Dwarven Waraxe, {CHA +1}<br/>\n13) Red Dragon Disciple (07):<br/>\n14) Red Dragon Disciple (08):<br/>\n15) Champion Of Torm (01): Power Attack<br/>\n16) Champion Of Torm (02): Cleave, {CHA +1}<br/>\n17) Bard (07):<br/>\n18) Champion Of Torm (03): Extra Smite<br/>\n19) Champion Of Torm (04): Great Cleave<br/>\n20) Champion Of Torm (05): {CHA +1}<br/>\n21) Red Dragon Disciple (09): Great Charisma 1<br/>\n22) Red Dragon Disciple (10):<br/>\n23) Champion Of Torm (06): Overwhelming Critical<br/>\n24) Champion Of Torm (07): Great Strength 1, {CHA +1}<br/>\n25) Champion Of Torm (08): Devastating Critical<br/>\n26) Champion Of Torm (09):<br/>\n27) Champion Of Torm (10): EWF: Dwarven Waraxe, Armour Skin<br/>\n28) Champion Of Torm (11): {STR +1}<br/>\n29) Champion Of Torm (12):<br/>\n30) Champion Of Torm (13): Epic Prowess<br/>\n31) Champion Of Torm (14): Great Smite 1<br/>\n32) Champion Of Torm (15): {STR +1}<br/>\n33) Champion Of Torm (16): Great Smite 2<br/>\n34) Champion Of Torm (17):<br/>\n35) Champion Of Torm (18): Great Smite 3<br/>\n36) Champion Of Torm (19): Great Smite 4, {STR +1}<br/>\n37) Bard (08):<br/>\n38) Champion Of Torm (20):<br/>\n39) Champion Of Torm (21): Great Smite 5<br/>\n40) Champion Of Torm (22): Great Smite 6, {STR +1}\u00a0<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>01: Discipline(4), Lore(4), Persuade(4), Tumble(4), UMD(2), Save(2),\u00a0\n03: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Perform(3), Tumble(1),\u00a0\n05: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Tumble(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n07: Discipline(1), Save(3),\u00a0\n09: Discipline(1), Save(7),\u00a0\n11: Discipline(1), Save(11),\u00a0\n13: Discipline(1), Save(15),\u00a0\n15: Discipline(1), Save(19),\u00a0\n17: Discipline(1), Tumble(11), UMD(14),\u00a0\n19: Discipline(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n21: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(8),\u00a0\n23: Discipline(1), Save(3),\u00a0\n25: Discipline(1), Save(9),\u00a0\n27: Discipline(1), Save(15),\u00a0\n29: Save(22),\u00a0\n31: Save(30),\u00a0\n33: Save(38),\u00a0\n35: Save(46),\u00a0\n37: Spellcraft(28), Tumble(20), UMD(8),\u00a0\n39: Discipline(4),\u00a0\n</details>\n\nSPECIAL NOTES:\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n* Immune to Fire\u00a0<br/>\n* Immune to Paralysis\u00a0<br/>\n* Immune to Sleep effects\u00a0<br/>\n* Dragon Breath 1/ Day: 6d10 Fire Dmg, Ref DC (19)<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit by Mick Dagger: Adjusted Strength, and AC.

The base AB competes really well with other smiters, and you have a \"rocket engine\" in the Divine wrath.<br/>\n I believe a paladin/cot build would be able to replicate the same base AB and a fair amount of GS, but you need the force of dragon blood to be able to get the strength up and have enough feats for dev crit in the same build.<br/>\n The only flaw I can see here is the lawful alignment, and that's easy to fix.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I know it's been a while since you posted this, but I have only seen it now.<br/>\n<br/>\n An overall really cool build. The only thing I would change are\u00a0the starting stats. Since 17 and 18 cost the same amount of points, why not start with 18 / 16 instead for 1 more AB right off the bat, then switch\u00a0the level 4\u00a0STR increase for CHA?<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, I just saw one more thing: whenever I go for Devcrit, I tend to take it as early as possible, so I would swap EWF and EP for Overcrit and Devcrit. You'll have less AB but you'll kill things instantly from early on.<br/>\n<br/>\n Other than that, I really like this guy. GJ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
