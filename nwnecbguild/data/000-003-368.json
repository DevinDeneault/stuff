      "content": "<div>Hello folks, thought I would try and start something for some entertainment and a way of getting more builds on the forums and such. Seemed like it was worth a try! I'll post my builds soon and if everything works out I'll post a few more random concepts. The concepts will vary, to get us started, here are a few religious types and some other guys.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst one. A human cleric, paladin or champion of Gwaeron Windstrom multi-classed as ranger, druid or both.<br/>\n<br/>\nGwaeron Windstrom<br/>\nAlignment: Neutral Good (for Champion PrC)<br/>\nPortfolio: Tracking, Rangers of the North<br/>\nAllowed Domains: Animal, Good, Knowledge, Plant, Travel (for Clerics)<br/>\nClergy Alignments: LG, NG, CG<br/>\nFavored Weapon: Greatsword (for Champion PrC)<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond one. A gnome cleric, paladin or champion of Baravar Cloakshadow multi-classed as either / rogue, illusionist or both.<br/>\n<br/>\nBaravar Cloakshadow<br/>\nAlignment: Neutral Good (for Champion PrC)<br/>\nPortfolio: Illusions, Deception, Traps, Wards<br/>\nAllowed Domains: Good, Protection, Trickery (for Clerics)<br/>\nClergy Alignments: LG, NG, CG<br/>\nFavored Weapon: Dagger (for Champion PrC)<br/>\n<br/>\nThird one. A human cleric of Velsharoon, multi-classed as necromancer and (<strong>optionally</strong>) pale master or blackguard.<br/>\n<br/>\nVelsharoon<br/>\nAlignment: Neutral Evil (for Blackguard PrC)<br/>\nPortfolio: Necromancy, Necromancers, Evil Liches, Undeath<br/>\nAllowed Domains: Death, Evil, Magic<br/>\nClergy Alignments: CN, LN, NE<br/>\nFavored Weapon: Quarterstaff (for Blackguard PrC  )<br/>\n<br/>\nFourth one. A any race wizard, with a specialization (any school, no generalist) and the following feats selected: still spell, light armor proficiency and medium armor proficiency.<br/>\n<br/>\nFifth one. A any race fighter, multi-classed as assassin and <strong>1 level</strong> of any base class, with the following feats selected: weapon focus (sling) and stealthy.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Took away the level restrictions to produce a stronger variety of viable builds.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hey there!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem I see with the concepts you propose is that multi-classing is WAY more effective for level 40 than for level 20 in general. Pre-epic, only Melee oriented build can be multi-classed \"profitably\", but because of BAB progression, you can't overdo it. A Wizard 20 is much stronger than a Wizard 16 Rogue 4, for example, and considerably stronger than a Wizard 17 Rogue 3 just because of the number of level 9 spells they'll have at their disposal. A Fighter 16 Rogue 4 is a lot stronger than a Fighter 20, because although you lose a couple of feats and 1 BAB, the gain in Tumble AC, Sneak Attack and skills more than makes up for it, and Fighters have no spells to be concerned with. Rather than attempting to build something along these lines, I'll happily help you improve the ones you can come up with.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"
