      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"><em>EDIT 1 August 2024: I've now finally played Ash through to Level 40 (the OC and Mines of Twin Summit). She needs to be played carefully and patiently until level 7, and really starts earning her corn at level 12. After that, she's a smooth levelling character and a great play. Initially she had 2 Improved Sneak Attacks, but I ended up taking Skill Mastery instead of one, so now she 'only' has 15d6+6 sneak damage. As much as anything, I decided to do this because Ash really taught me a lot about the fun to be had in blowing bad dudes to pieces. I would have taken it earlier - probably swapping with Crippling Strike - but it didn't occur to me until about level 33. I've kept all the discussion about her included from her time in the Build Request/ Unfinalized Builds forum just to give a fuller picture of her construction. She's also something of an RP build, so feel free to take points from Charisma and redistribute should you wish.</em><br/>\n<br/>\nTime for adding a halfling Rogue to my repertoire. She got her name from when she was barely a toddler, found abandoned and freezing in winter snows by a band of mercenaries. She couldn't remember her own name, but would snuggle up next to the campfire as close as she could and sleep in its embers, so the men called her Ashy-Arse after the grey stains on her the following morning. She quickly learned to take care of herself, never going hungry and \"borrowing\" both clothes, then trimming them to her diminutive size, and knives, used to feed to her curiosity - she could not bear not to know what was in the various travelling chests of the mercs. They tolerated such activities, for she was always smiling and full of entertaining tricks of the hand and eye that gave the men rare smiles at the end of the day. As she grew, she deemed the \"Arse\" bit of her name something of an embarrassment, so dropped it like a broken plate, and was given the nickname \"The Squirrel\" for her agility, inquisitiveness, and ability to hoard assorted \"could come in useful\" items. The kinder men of the group also taught our young hin some fighting skills so she could defend herself, if needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, to the build. Rogue/ Fighter/ CoT has been successfully done many times before - including several excellent halfling builds (I'm struggling to provide links atm, but special mention should go to Tyr Templar's Shadow Sword - R26/ F4/ CoT10; and Mick Dagger's Halfling Champion - R20/ F6/ CoT14), but I'm hoping Ash brings something new to the table. I'm sure you'll let me know if not. I've built her my way, so there are various alterations you might prefer.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, here she is.

(Even if my hand and knees hurt now.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know me far too well, Mick. My initial draft had INT at 14 and both STR and CHA boosted by 2 each, but I shed that for more INT. However, I'm now wondering whether dropping CON to 12 (328 hps and 26 Fort ain't too bad for an ED Rogue, after all) and at least lifting CHA to 10. I could raise it a little higher - to 12 - depending on the below (which apart from RP reasons would give me an extra 2 whole skill points to play with!). As you know, Stag doesn't do 8 strength, which I appreciate would do the same, but will never happen in one of my builds - it hurt enough to drop to 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou're right about kukri - and there's no RP reason for it. I could easily drop Exotic for dagger focus (though I do prefer slashing over piercing damage), which could give her Iron Will or LoH to bring that Will save up to 20+ (I was hoping saves v spells and fear might help compensate). And if I dropped Imp Crit, I could drop CON to 10 and boost CHA to 12. Toughness would be an option to take the hps back up to 328, along with Dodge or Expertise as other choices. My gut is saying I should stick with Imp Crit - and I've learned to listen to something that big - but could be persuaded otherwise, depending on your CHA modifier!<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in essence, I'm bloody delighted some of your lessons in Rogue have gone in!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I know she's wearing footwear in her pic, but they're special boots of extra springiness...honest.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I've also reached a truce with my gut, which is much more amenable after eating, and dropped Imp Crit for Toughness, raising her CHA to 12. There is a practical reason for the latter as well as RP, which is that she's meant to play in party, and has no business getting involved with sneak/crit immunes: she has big burly types around her to deal with that malarkey, while she makes herself useful trapping and stalling others. But those extra hit points are handy just in case she's discovered too early. So I shall go amend accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'm surprised nobody mentioned this, and maybe I'm wrong, but you could go Rogue 28 / Fighter 4 / CoT 8 for the same AB, same number of feats and pretty much everything else the same, except +1 to all saves gained from this switch. Please disregard this comment if I'm wrong, but can you take EWS on a CoT level once you have WS? I was under the impression you could. If not, that would require you to lose 1 epic feat for WS in epics, making it not worth the switch.<br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise, excellent build!

It's not even about EWS in itself, it's the fact you'd need to take Fighter 4 in epics, keeping your spread as Rogue 12, Fighter 3 CoT 5, with the same number of feats in theory, but in practice you'd need to spend one of your epic feats on WS, which would mean sacrificing something else. OK, fair enough.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nBut just in theory also, you could consider Rogue 24 / Fighter 6 / CoT 10, dropping Skill Mastery for a couple more Epic Feats and a slight bonus to saves. You'd lose 2d6 SA damage from Rogue 25 and 27, but you could in theory drop Toughness, get WF on a Shortbow, then WS and EWS on said bow and be quite versatile in combat! Just some food for thought!\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, mate! Good to speak to you once more! I've been lurking here still, but being that I kind of quit this game in favor of Baldur's Gate 3 (I only have time to play one game, if at all!), I often get things mixed up between the two rulesets.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake care!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
