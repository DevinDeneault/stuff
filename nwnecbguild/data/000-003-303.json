A pure monk is Monk 40, but I get your gist... heavy monk build with boosts from one or secondary classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n First, unless your server has a modified feat requirement, epic dodge requires SD 10 or 10 rog/5 SD to qualify.\n<blockquote><div>\n 1) PvM or PvP - Not sure what this means.\u00a0 Most places say it is a PvP area.<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n PvM = build optimized to kill monsters, PvP = build optimized to duel. No build can be optimized to do both though many builds built for PvM may be adequate for some dueling (and vice versa). For a dueling build, you'll need to decide the class(es) that you will try to confront. Monks SR is especially handy fighting spellcasting that requires an SR check. But you should decide what the main focus is to be and build accordingly. The fact that there are PvP areas only means you can either duel or not when challenged. That is your choice. In my experience, unless I really intended a dueling career, I would decline all such offers and, if they became a pest, just log off if the DM would not intercede. Like I said, you decide how to handle such incursions.\n<blockquote><div>\n 2) Level cap - The Max level is 60<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n Legendary levels 41-60. Having never played a server capped higher than 40, I can't offer any recommendations past 40, so assuming you get that far, your server-mates would be able to help better than guessing on my part. Other members of the guild may be able to help with that but would probably need to know what alternatives are available per your server.<br/>\n<br/>\n But let's cross that bridge when we get to it. K?\n<blockquote><div>\n 3) Race preference - Human<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n For the subrace you've chosen, this is required.\n<blockquote><div>\n 4) Class preference - 35 Monk and 5 SD for uncanny dodge and epic dodge<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n As previously mentioned, default ED require at least 10 levels in SD. ED means this will have to be a DEX build.\n<blockquote><div>\n 5) Melee preference - Looking for unarmed for the special Monk gloves for 35 levels of Monk<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n Makes sense. But you'll need to make a choice between the gloves and ED, unfortunately.\n<blockquote><div>\n 6) Range preference - No range weapons<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n Actually, you may find that shurikens can be quite effective in PvM on a weapon switch with all that DEX. But it is just an interesting by-product. Wouldn't focus in it.\n<blockquote><div>\n 7) Weapon preference - Unarmed<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n The gloves. Yes.\n<blockquote><div>\n 8) Maximum item enhancement - +9<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n High-magic environment or extremely high mid-magic. Probably means you will be facing lots of high AC creatures and/or PC combatants. Your wisdom will also help a bit with that.\n<blockquote><div>\n 9) Spellcasting -No spell casting<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n Actually, an SD has some feat-based casting ability like daze &amp; summons. But they have minimal impact on the build so we can ignore them.\n<blockquote><div>\n 10) Custom factors - I am not sure what if this is what they mean but will be using a Shaolin Subrace.<br/>\n Shaolin Restriction<br/>\n race human<br/>\n favored class none<br/>\n Wis +3Cha -4<br/>\n Base SR 5 +2 per level<br/>\n Feats:<br/>\n improved stunning fist<br/>\n 5Weapon specialization unarmed<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n not sure what that \"5\" is all about. does that mean WS unarmed adds 5 damage instead of 2? or does the number belong to the imp stunning fist DC somehow?\n<blockquote><div>\n epic weapon specialization unarmed<br/>\n epic improved ki strike 5<br/>\n Magic Res 10<br/>\n 50% concealment<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n Is this permanent or a version of Empty Body's 50% 2x/day?\n<blockquote><div>\n ECL 3<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n I guess this has something to do with how much XP you get per kill at each level and how fast you can level the PC.\n<blockquote><div>\n Any ideas??\u00a0 Any questions??\u00a0 To Much Information??\u00a0 :)<br/>\n<br/>\n David</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">\u00a0</div>\n\n Better request format, David. It helps the guild make useful suggestions when understanding the environment better.<br/>\n<br/>\n Ok. Now to get started organizing a bit...<br/>\n<br/>\n A DEX build needs to develop some damage. Right now, all you have is the WS/EWS from the subrace and the STR you can muster from equipment. I am assuming the monk gloves have some uber damage property, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n But why SD? Does HiPS work on this server? Important to know. The AC benefits are secondary IMO to committing to the class because you'll need mobility to qualify for SD and may be a bit feat-starved w/o fighter levels. BTW, I recommend enough fighter or COT levels to reach the highest UBAB. You won't need many.<br/>\n<br/>\n Since your main build decision at this point is to choose between epic dodge and the special gloves, I'll await your decision before throwing any further blind build recommendations out.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I guess HipMaestro forgot about Monk getting Improved Evasion at level 9. Monks get so many feats for free (Cleave, {Improved} Knockdown) and his subrace gets Weapon Focus / Specialization, so I don't think he'll be feat-starved. This should be totally doable.<br/>\n Here's another approach to consider, not an upgrade but a sidegrade: Monk 35 / Fighter 5. You would lose Uncanny Dodge and Epic Dodge (which is a lot), but you would gain another attack per round and Epic Weapon Specialization (which is also a lot). In such a high-magic environment, I think the Monk 35 / SD 5 build would be better because that gear means you don't have to worry so much about damage output. Then again, high-magic environments favor dual kamas over unarmed.<br/>\n ECL +3 means Effective Character Level +3, which is a severe penalty to balance all those advantages of the subrace. He would have to get enough experience to reach normal level 5 in order to level up to level 2, and when he has enough experience to be level 15, he will only be level 12 instead, and so on. I don't know if these subraces are on his server, but other examples of ECL penalty are Drow ECL +2, Svirfneblin (Deep Gnome) ECL +3, and Aasimar ECL +1. The OC uses negative ECL to help out \"weaker\" classes in earlier levels.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

And the list of brain burps just gets longer by the hour. Goes to show how often I've built SDs. I've always equated SDs with HiPS which is pretty much nuked on my fav playlands, but from here out will be paying more attention to that shortcut to ED. I do like playing monks, in fact.\n<blockquote><div>\n Here's another approach to consider, not an upgrade but a sidegrade: Monk 35 / Fighter 5.

Scrape up some damage for a dexpecker any way you can. But I suspect the mysterious exalted monk gloves will furnish lots of damage else why would anyone commit 35 levels to monk class? I once owned a pair of monk gloves that cast Level 40 IGMS OnHit. Can it get any sillier than that? I doubt it. \u00a0Lagged the server something awful when a party of five monks were attacking hordes.\n<blockquote><div>\n ECL +3 means Effective Character Level +3, which is a severe penalty to balance all those advantages of the subrace.

I knew there was a bias but not whether better/worse XP gain or magnitude. Have seen lots of this on RP servers, but I don't RP so it's always secondhand information for me that gets ignored. All it means to me is repeating confrontations to reach the same level, but then again, more drops to scavenge through.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Not with shaolin features that you listed in #10 of the OP. \u00a0Standard Invisibility is all you need. \u00a0The highest concealment achievable by any means is 50% unless your server has modified the default ruleset about concealment.<br/>\n<br/>\n IMHO, undispellable 50% concealment by virtue of just subrace selection is near godly and well worth the human limitation. \u00a0Besides the slight bump to DEX that an elf gets (with the corresponding penalty to CON), the only other racial bias I've personally found very useful is Keen Sense. \u00a0Some of their\u00a0affinities\u00a0may also help optimize detection checks.<br/>\n<br/>\n Ummm... are there any interesting benefits for the halfling race on this server? \u00a0I realize that would discount the shaolin subrace, but just curious. (This question posed in regards to stealthy DEX build considerations.)</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Besides, you have so many skill points already, and so few class skills, that it was hard to decide what to do with them all. I assumed that in such a high-magic world, you would be able to max your saves (no more than +20) with gear alone, so Spellcraft would be a waste. You won't be using a weapon or armor or traps, so the crafting skills are out. Concentration is in there to help resist Taunts.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
