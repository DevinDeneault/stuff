      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Heya, folks! <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been without internet for the last couple of days, which has given me some time to work on a very cool concept build (but nonetheless optimized) of a Dwarven Paladin hero. Obviously, he is supposed to be a paladin, but since he is a dwarf, he also needs to represent dwarvishness by not giving a $%&amp;\u00a8about social standards. That will be represented by his total lack of Charisma (score of 6), which essentially makes him a fear-immune, self-buffing fighter for hack'n'slash purposes. Fighter comes in with the combat feats, Palading throws in the immunity to fear and the buffs and Rogue compliments the package nicely with Tumble and UMD. I have found that this toon will actually have a buffed AB equal to that of a Fighter 12 Weapon Master 25 Rogue 3 build on WoG. While the latter ends up with 65 AB, this one will have 66 fully buffed AB, and that's no small feat. As if that weren't enough, he can Taunt some opponents just in case, but with 6 CHA, forget about Taunting casters and high-concentration mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, without further delay, here is the unfinished but IMO very strong Ugly Mug Hero:<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladin(26), Fighter(12), Rogue(2), Dwarf<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 18 (34)<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 12<br/>\nWIS: 14<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 6<br/>\n<br/>\nDwarf: (Darkvision, Defensive Training vs. Giants, Stonecunning, Hardiness vs. Poison, Hardiness vs. Spells, Offensive Training vs. Goblinoids, Offensive Training vs. Orcs, Skill Affinity: Lore)<br/>\n01: Fighter(1): Power Attack, Cleave<br/>\n02: Paladin(1)<br/>\n03: Paladin(2): Knockdown, {Smite Evil}<br/>\n04: Paladin(3): STR+1, (STR=19)<br/>\n05: Paladin(4)<br/>\n06: Paladin(5): Expertise<br/>\n07: Paladin(6)<br/>\n08: Paladin(7): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n09: Paladin(8): Improved Knockdown<br/>\n10: Paladin(9)<br/>\n11: Paladin(10)<br/>\n12: Paladin(11): STR+1, Improved Critical: Longsword, (STR=21)<br/>\n13: Paladin(12)<br/>\n14: Paladin(13)<br/>\n15: Paladin(14): Extend Spell<br/>\n16: Fighter(2): STR+1, Great Cleave, (STR=22)<br/>\n17: Fighter(3)<br/>\n18: Fighter(4): Weapon Focus: Longsword, Weapon Specialization: Longsword<br/>\n19: Fighter(5)<br/>\n20: Fighter(6): STR+1, Blind Fight, (STR=23)<br/>\n21: Paladin(15): Armor Skin<br/>\n22: Fighter(7)<br/>\n23: Fighter(8): Overwhelming Critical: Longsword<br/>\n24: Rogue(1): STR+1, Great Strength I, (STR=25)<br/>\n25: Fighter(9)<br/>\n26: Fighter(10): Devastating Critical: Longsword<br/>\n27: Paladin(16): Great Strength II, (STR=26)<br/>\n28: Paladin(17): STR+1, (STR=27)<br/>\n29: Paladin(18)<br/>\n30: Paladin(19): Great Strength III, (STR=28)<br/>\n31: Paladin(20)<br/>\n32: Paladin(21): STR+1, (STR=29)<br/>\n33: Paladin(22): Great Strength IV, (STR=30)<br/>\n34: Paladin(23): Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword<br/>\n35: Paladin(24)<br/>\n36: Paladin(25): STR+1, Great Strength V, (STR=32)<br/>\n37: Fighter(11)<br/>\n38: Fighter(12): Epic Weapon Specialization: Longsword<br/>\n39: Rogue(2): Great Strength VI, {Evasion}, (STR=33)<br/>\n40: Paladin(26): STR+1, Epic Prowess, (STR=34)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 432<br/>\nSkillpoints: 184<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 25/18/15<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +2, Poison: +2<br/>\nBAB: 30<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 46 (melee), 30 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 19/30<br/>\nSpell Casting: Paladin(4)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscipline 43(55), Open Lock 1(0), Search 14(16), Taunt 43(41), Tumble 40(39), UMD 42(40)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Discipline(4), Open Lock(1), Save(10), <br/>\n02: Discipline(1), Taunt(5), Save(8), <br/>\n03: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(10), <br/>\n04: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(12), <br/>\n05: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(14), <br/>\n06: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(16), <br/>\n07: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(18), <br/>\n08: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(20), <br/>\n09: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(22), <br/>\n10: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(24), <br/>\n11: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(26), <br/>\n12: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(28), <br/>\n13: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(30), <br/>\n14: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(32), <br/>\n15: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(34), <br/>\n16: Discipline(1), Save(37), <br/>\n17: Discipline(1), Save(40), <br/>\n18: Discipline(1), Save(43), <br/>\n19: Discipline(1), Save(46), <br/>\n20: Discipline(1), Save(49), <br/>\n21: Discipline(1), Taunt(6), Save(46), <br/>\n22: Discipline(1), Save(49), <br/>\n23: Discipline(1), Save(52), <br/>\n24: Search(10), Tumble(25), UMD(27), <br/>\n25: Discipline(2), Save(2), <br/>\n26: Discipline(1), Save(5), <br/>\n27: Discipline(1), Taunt(6), Save(2), <br/>\n28: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(4), <br/>\n29: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(6), <br/>\n30: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(8), <br/>\n31: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(10), <br/>\n32: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(12), <br/>\n33: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(14), <br/>\n34: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(16), <br/>\n35: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(18), <br/>\n36: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(20), <br/>\n37: Discipline(1), Save(23), <br/>\n38: Discipline(1), Save(26), <br/>\n39: Search(4), Tumble(15), UMD(15), Save(2), <br/>\n40: Discipline(2), Taunt(4), <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what do you guys think?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Where I play, the sooner you get the feat the better. Yes, the toughest lvl 40 bosses and some other 30+ CR ones are crit-immune, so if you delay devcrit too much it will sort of be less effective. However, it's an environment-dependant choice, so if you face many of those crit-immunes, maybe you can switch them up or even drop them altogether, the question then would have to be, what would you pick in their place? Anyway, it is designed for the environment I know, and there it'll thrive as is. Tweak to taste, brother <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
