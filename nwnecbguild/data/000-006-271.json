      "content": "<div>Well, after posting this guy on the Build Request section and getting virtually no feedback, I went ahead and compared him with other similar builds in the Search Engine. Turns out that he's offensively better than all of them, while giving up a bit of saves. The idea here, for those who haven't read the topic in the other section, was to make a real dwarven paladin, but not one of those polite paladins with manners and stuff. This is a guy who doesn't understand how to behave socially and is misinterpreted by many because of that (6 Charisma). But at heart he is a good soul, defender of the good and righteous. Powergaming-wise, he is a fantastic offensive build with Fighter AB and damage, very high STR (the highest of its kind) and a fully buffed AB that rivals that of a Fighter 12 WM 25 Rogue 3. He gets Devastating Critical pretty early considering he's not a Half Orc, and has many tools in his arsenal. To help a bit with AC, he gets Expertise early, which can be used in conjunction with Taunt to improve your combat prowess in many situations. I should also note there is a 20% XP penalty from level 24 on.

Fame by Bloodymerc, which is an ED DEX build and has insane XP penalty: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build251230.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 51230.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n - Defender of the Faith by Kail Pendragon, which goes for more Rogue and Crippling Strike and ends up with much less STR than this one: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build251574.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 51574.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n - Grizzled Knight by Tattoed Monk, which is the one that comes closer to this one in terms of offensive power, but he went for 14 CHA and doesn't have as many combat feats as this one, ends up with 32 STR, as opposed to this guy's 34, while having a little bit of charisma (and being human): <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build304437.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 04437.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n This build differs from the above in that none have ditched CHA as I have here, and so he has no use for the signature paladin moves, like DM, DS and DG. Paladin here will add fighter-type BAB and the very good buffs in its spellbook. You can forget about CHA altogether and maybe get some Wisdom gear to get more spell slots, but the most capital thing you need to do is cap STR if you can through items and get some AC items, like Full Plate, Cloak of Protection, Amulet of Natural Armor, Monk boots and stuff like that. All in all, the AB feats like EWF and EP are really not necessary, so they're left for later in order to prioritize idispellability and Armor Skin.<br/>\n<br/>\n Well, I hope you enjoy playing this guy as much as I do.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div>"

True, it's hard to find a crafter Paladin, but it's possible, in fact I will make one just in case, then buy them through a vendor <br/>\n<br/>\nIMO Expertise / Taunt is too good a combo if used correctly, to give up on, have you ever tried it? I used to get surrounded by those Bugbear Battleragers in Critwall with my lvl 20 Paladin WM with NO TUMBLE AC AND NO UMD, I would turn on Expertise, Taunt them and kill them one by one whilst getting hit very seldom. You can also use it with this dude to cast DF in combat, cuz it will only deactivate after the first spell is cast, and since you're only going to cast one anyway, it works perfectly for you!<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hail, guildsmates!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been playing this build recently, and although not necessary, you can move that Paladin 15 level to pre-epic, taking 15 Pal levels straight to cap your GMW and Divine Favor. The only downside is that you lose a Taunt dump at level 21, but at that time your AB is so high that you probably don't need it anyway. Instead of posting the modified version, I'll leave it here as a viable tweak.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"
