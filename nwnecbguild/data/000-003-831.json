(3/day, fairly short duration)<br/>\nBarbarians get 15% physical immunity with Mighty Rage. (3/day, fairly short duration)<br/>\nWeapons can now give up to 6d12 damage (theoretially) even before I add +d6 divine, keen, 2d12 Mass Crit and +20AB to them.<br/>\nAssassin now gets +d6\u00a0 acid damage for every three levels they take for the class.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith these newfangled ideas abounding, is there finally a Glorious Monk Build available that I can play?<br/>\n<br/>\nI want 6-10 attacks per round.

      "content": "<div>Hi Cornflower!<br/>\n<br/>\nTo clarify you are looking for:<br/>\n- a Improved Two Weapon Fighting Dual Kama Monk Build<br/>\n- that can solo a high magic environment with very difficult bosses<br/>\n- there are plenty of damage and ability buffs to help deal damage with weapons<br/>\n- assassin gets an additional +6 acid damage every 3 levels without needing to catch an opponent flat footed or flanked, on top of the usual death attack bonus<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I have got this information correct I think you should consider Mick Dagger's <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/kama-shinobi-monk-9-assassin-26-sd-5-t2350791.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kama-Shinobi</a> here<br/>\n<br/>\n- Up to 9 attacks per round with flurry and haste,\u00a0<br/>\n- HiPS,\u00a0<br/>\n- undispellable improved invisibility for 50% concealment,\u00a0<br/>\n- 13d6 death attack,\u00a0<br/>\n- death attack DC 38\u00a0<br/>\n- base AB 40 dual wielding Kamas,\u00a0 which will be buffed to 66 AB with equipment (the cap) and max dex ability bonuses<br/>\n- 26 assassin levels means additional +48 acid damage per attack (or 432 acid damage per round if every attack hit)<br/>\n- has UMD for spell casting<br/>\n- epic dodge and naked 31 AC, 39 reflex save with improved evasion and deflect arrows<br/>\n- can be a speed demon and run faster than a dungeon master if you combine perma-haste, monk speed and a scroll of expedious retreat<br/>\n- its also an elf with keen senses!<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally a build with 70 replies has to be one of very significant interest :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe there could be some adjustments to get 27 assassin levels (by swapping the level 27 shadowdancer level with assassin?) for extra acid and death attack damage? Mick Dagger might also some suggestions as well, if this is the build that you are interested in? I understand Stagmeister has also played this build through Aielund<br/>\n<br/>\nDemos in the thread also suggested making a small adjustment to increase Dex further in exchange for Str and Cons to 20 in a high magic environment, for an ending dex of 38 (and extra AB, AC)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think Cornflower?</div>"

      "content": "<div>OK. First. The Kama-Shinobi is very interesting. I'm not sure if I'm ready for a HIPS-er. It's a bit late bloomer (which in my case is not a problem, I have a toon that I can delete/recreate and start at lvl 23ish). Anyway, I need to think about that, but it's an excellent idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond. I like the Kama Whirlwind (I'll try to refrain from calling it Ultimate Woodpecker). It's essentially a kama-fighter with some monk levels for monkish features. It's easy to play, easy to redistribute skills for my personal taste. It's an even later bloomer (again, no big deal). Also, I have an abundance of useful Fighter-stuff laying around (Gloves with DR and STR4, etc, etc) so I can easily get this up and running. Again, an excellent idea. For a quick-build overnight (I guess) it's kinda awesome. Also, with that extremely high AB, I might even drop a few DEX points and put in WIS. I'm not sure I even need 52AB.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a simple way to rank builds. AB+AC. The Kenobi is no 7 on my list. This Kama Whirlwind is like top 3 on my list. It's basically a full dex-based fighter, only monk. Interesting. I may just have to try this build. Unless I feel brave and try something new, the Kama-Shinobi. Damn, I need to think about this. And this week too, when I'm away and can't play. Argh. I will over-analyze this for all week!<br/>\n<br/>\nEither way, I bow (again) to the expertise that is the people of this forum. I'm impressed. Thank you guys!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, where did I put my +12Tumble boots, with haste, 6AC, knockdown immunity and the rest....</div>"

      "content": "<div>Also, side note: 6d12 is not found anywhere. You have to make it and the probability is so small it's ridiculous. First you gather polished gems, which you convert to faceted, etc. It's 3 per level, so... math... 243 gems gives you one Legendary Stone, which gives three random values between d8 (I think) and 2d12. The chance to get each value is not known, but assuming it's \"rectangular probability\" (don't know the proper English term) the chance of getting three rolls of 2d12 is ... I don't have the time to calculate that... Low! That's not even counting the various damage types you can get. It's possible to get magical, but I've only gotten that once so far, usually it's Fire, Acid, the usual stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best I have gotten in about a month of playing and gathering gems is 2d10+2d8+d10.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just wanted to point out that you're not going to go to the tavern used store and pick up some Kama's with 6d12 bonus damage. That's a serious long-term project.</div>"

At least the rogue version can shoot them with a shortbow until lvl 15, the monk one with sling or shuriken</div>"
