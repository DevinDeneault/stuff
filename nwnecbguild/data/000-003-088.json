      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">First of all, this is just a fun build, a brainstrom to get the most out of a messed up idea :)<br/>\n<br/>\n Edit:<br/>\n I realized I didn't write anything about class and weapon selection... :) I mean why barb and why unarmed?<br/>\n So, bioware granted us packages at character creation, every base class got 4-5 or more variants of these. I never heard anybody to recommend the use of these packages, but I thought some of the ideas might be interesting. This is one of those ideas, the savage package for the barbarian.<br/>\n<br/>\n This is the description of the package:<br/>\n The savagery of this package is remarkable even among barbarians, as he prefers to use his bare hands in melee instead of resorting to a weakling\u2019s weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\n I think the unarmed fight is the privilege of the monk, so I don't want to use any monk levels in the build. The lack of monk levels leaves the unarmed damage at 1d3 (for medium races, it is 1d2 for halflings and gnomes), so the most important thing is to get the strength to as high as reasonably possible and/or get WS/EWS. The second thing is, that those gloves that help the character at unarmed fight are monk only (at least in OC they are), so we need a class that has access to UMD to pierce damage resistance with those items (we don't get ki strike). That leaves me two choices, a Bb/Bard/RDD, or a Bb/Fighter/Rogue-or-Ass-or-Bard.<br/>\n<br/>\n The first build is the one with the RDD levels:<br/>\n<br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\n<br/>\n Barbarian(28), Bard(2), Red Dragon Disciple(10)<br/>\n<br/>\n Race: Half-Orc<br/>\n Alignment: any non-lawful<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 20 (42)<br/>\n DEX: 8<br/>\n CON: 16 (18)<br/>\n WIS: 8<br/>\n INT: 10 (12)<br/>\n CHA: 6 (8)<br/>\n<br/>\n Half-Orc: (Darkvision)<br/>\n 01: Barbarian(1): Weapon Focus: Unarmed<br/>\n 02: Barbarian(2): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br/>\n 03: Barbarian(3): Armor Proficiency Heavy<br/>\n 04: Barbarian(4): STR+1, (STR=21)<br/>\n 05: Barbarian(5)<br/>\n 06: Barbarian(6): Power Attack<br/>\n 07: Barbarian(7)<br/>\n 08: Barbarian(8): STR+1, (STR=22)<br/>\n 09: Barbarian(9): Improved Critical: Unarmed<br/>\n 10: Barbarian(10)<br/>\n 11: Barbarian(11)<br/>\n 12: Barbarian(12): STR+1, Cleave, (STR=23)<br/>\n 13: Barbarian(13)<br/>\n 14: Barbarian(14)<br/>\n 15: Barbarian(15): Great Cleave<br/>\n 16: Barbarian(16): STR+1, (STR=24)<br/>\n 17: Barbarian(17)<br/>\n 18: Barbarian(18): Blind Fight<br/>\n 19: Barbarian(19)<br/>\n 20: Barbarian(20): STR+1, (STR=25)<br/>\n 21: Barbarian(21): Epic Weapon Focus: Unarmed<br/>\n 22: Bard(1)<br/>\n 23: Red Dragon Disciple(1)<br/>\n 24: Red Dragon Disciple(2): STR+1, Epic Prowess, (STR=28)<br/>\n 25: Red Dragon Disciple(3)<br/>\n 26: Red Dragon Disciple(4): (STR=30)<br/>\n 27: Red Dragon Disciple(5): Armor Skin<br/>\n 28: Red Dragon Disciple(6): STR+1, (STR=31)<br/>\n 29: Red Dragon Disciple(7): (CON=18)<br/>\n 30: Red Dragon Disciple(8): Great Strength I, (STR=32)<br/>\n 31: Red Dragon Disciple(9): (INT=12)<br/>\n 32: Red Dragon Disciple(10): STR+1, (STR=37), (CHA=8)<br/>\n 33: Barbarian(22): Great Strength II, (STR=38)<br/>\n 34: Barbarian(23)<br/>\n 35: Barbarian(24): Overwhelming Critical: Unarmed<br/>\n 36: Barbarian(25): STR+1, Great Strength III, (STR=40)<br/>\n 37: Barbarian(26)<br/>\n 38: Bard(2)<br/>\n 39: Barbarian(27): Great Strength IV, (STR=41)<br/>\n 40: Barbarian(28): STR+1, Devastating Critical: Unarmed, (STR=42)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 592<br/>\n Skillpoints: 161<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 26/15/15<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +3, Traps: +5<br/>\n BAB: 30<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 50 (melee), 30 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 23/34<br/>\n<br/>\n Discipline 43(59), Listen 8(7), Lore 8(11), Perform 7(6), Spellcraft 14(15), Tumble 40(39), UMD 41(40)<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Discipline(4), Lore(4), Save(8),<br/>\n 02: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Save(10),<br/>\n 03: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Save(12),<br/>\n 04: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Save(14),<br/>\n 05: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Save(16),<br/>\n 06: Discipline(1), Save(19),<br/>\n 07: Discipline(1), Save(22),<br/>\n 08: Discipline(1), Save(25),<br/>\n 09: Discipline(1), Save(28),<br/>\n 10: Discipline(1), Save(31),<br/>\n 11: Discipline(1), Save(34),<br/>\n 12: Discipline(1), Save(37),<br/>\n 13: Discipline(1), Save(40),<br/>\n 14: Discipline(1), Save(43),<br/>\n 15: Discipline(1), Save(46),<br/>\n 16: Discipline(1), Save(49),<br/>\n 17: Discipline(1), Save(52),<br/>\n 18: Discipline(1), Save(55),<br/>\n 19: Discipline(1), Save(58),<br/>\n 20: Discipline(1), Save(61),<br/>\n 21: Discipline(1), Save(64),<br/>\n 22: Discipline(1), Perform(5), Spellcraft(12), Tumble(25), UMD(25),<br/>\n 23: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1),<br/>\n 24: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1),<br/>\n 25: Discipline(1), Save(1),<br/>\n 26: Discipline(1), Save(2),<br/>\n 27: Discipline(1), Save(3),<br/>\n 28: Discipline(1), Save(4),<br/>\n 29: Discipline(1), Save(5),<br/>\n 30: Discipline(1), Save(6),<br/>\n 31: Discipline(1), Save(7),<br/>\n 32: Discipline(1), Save(9),<br/>\n 33: Discipline(1), Save(13),<br/>\n 34: Discipline(1), Save(17),<br/>\n 35: Discipline(1), Save(21),<br/>\n 36: Discipline(1), Save(25),<br/>\n 37: Discipline(1), Save(29),<br/>\n 38: Discipline(1), Perform(2), Tumble(15), UMD(16),<br/>\n 39: Discipline(1), Listen(4),<br/>\n 40: Discipline(1), Listen(4).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n In vanilla 1.69 an unarmed strike will not provoke an AoO if the character has something equipped in the gloves/bracers slot, so the Improved Unarmed Strike isn't necessary.<br/>\n I'm not sore about the distribution of the skillpoints... that 8 points in listen at the end is just to dump them into something. My other idea is to ignore spellcraft completely and decrease the UMD to 36, so I have 27 points which can be put into Intimidate, and get a weak Terrifying Rage instead of armor skin... or instead of 2 great strength feats get terrifying and thundering rage if thundering works with unarmed (I'm not sure about that). Or just dump them into set trap, a modified rank of 15 is not so far... maybe some points from discipline could help here.<br/>\n DevCrit is pretty late, maybe Over and Dev should be swapped with Epic Prowess and Armor Skin.<br/>\n<br/>\n I don't want to use that build anywhere. Well, maybe in that test module, to see if it can beat that nasty prismatic dragon (I'm sure it won't be able to defeat her). Or a modified version in OC, with a pre-epic distribution of 12-18 Bb / 2-4 Bard / 0-4 RDD, but that is unlikely.<br/>\n<br/>\n The few advantages vs a monk:<br/>\n - can use any armor and shields<br/>\n - has anyone seen a monk with 50 AB naked and unarmed? :)<br/>\n<br/>\n Well, it is not a monk :D<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

This leaves 6 unassigned points... maybe 5 more into UMD? Conc is optional for PvP, in PvM it could be swapped for 15 modified in set trap and 1 in disable (to disarm our own traps), or 40 modified in spellcraft to get some saves vs spells.<br/>\n Made some minor changes in leveling: I put a barbarian level at clvl 27 to get the terrifying rage asap, and the second Bard level is at 37, not 38 (it was at 38 because of UMD 41).<br/>\n The pre-epic feats remained the same, WF: Unarmed, Armor Prof: Heavy (is it necessary?), Power Attack, IC: Unarmed, Cleave, Great Cleave, Blind Fight.<br/>\n There are more changes at epic levels.<br/>\n The general feats are in that order: Over Crit: Unarmed, Dev Crit: Unarmed, Terrifying Rage, Expertise, Improved Expertise, Great Strength I, Great Strength II.<br/>\n The two Barbarian bonus feats are: EWF: Unarmed and Epic prowess.<br/>\n There is no Armor Skin now. If I drop 1 more point from AB and damage (start STR at 19 and only one Great Strength feat) it is possible to get that too, this way CON can start at 14, and DEX or WIS at 9 or CHA at 7. OR leave STR at 20, and grab another epic general feat (Called shot? KD? It is very late for them...).<br/>\n<br/>\n Rogue build:<br/>\n Skills: in PvM the skills should be something like this: Disable Trap 1 (5), Discipline 43 (55), Intimidate 43 (41), Listen 43 (42), Set Trap 16 (15), Taunt 43 (41), Tumble 40 (39), UMD 35 (33). We have 2 unassigned point, which is not enough to make a significant change in any skill. Maybe they can go into open lock, to pick locks up to DC 21+thieves' tools.<br/>\n Skills for PvP: from the three classes only the fighter has the concentration as class skill, so the last fighter level should be as late as possible... if someone wants to PvP with this, my idea here is to drop 1 level of rogue (we don't get anything useful from that 4th rogue level), and get one more fighter at 39 or 40 to max out concentration. Of course there will be an XP penalty for this, and we have to drop a full skill for that conc. Anyway, if someone wants to PvP with an unarmed char, go with a monk...<br/>\n Some changes in leveling: rogue levels are at 23, 27, 32 and 37, fighters are at 21, 22, 31 and 33.<br/>\n On pre-epic I dropped KD and IKD to get Expertise and Improved Expertise, on epic levels I dropped two great stregths to get Terrifying Rage and Blind Fight, the others remained the same.<br/>\n I don't know if Called Shot could be put anywhere... maybe we could drop two more great strengths and get called shot and KD... or maybe with more fighter levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n Improved Unarmed Strike:<br/>\n As I mentioned earlier, IUS does not necessary as if we have equipped something in the gloves / bracers slot, AoOs will not occure.

If I drop that seven feats (if I count those two Great Dex also), they could go to feats like ESF: Hide / Move Silent maybe Intimidate too, Epic Prowess, Improved Sneaks (I just realized sneak =/= snake :D), maybe some combat feats (KD for example).<br/>\n The other thing, all the builds here are just simple melee builds that focuses on unarmed instead of some weapon, nothing more that make the builds unique (just swap \"unarmed\" to \"scimitar\", and you get a standard melee build). So I put stunning fists in this, which is useful for sneaks, and works only unarmed. Delfect Arrows could be another handy feat agaist archers, that could be another option instead of concealment (but we need better reflex save for this one - that 18 at the end is not bad, but on earlier levels, especially pre-epic the chances are below 50% to succefully deflect an arrow).<br/>\n<br/>\n One flaw in this build, that the pre-epic levels are a pain with that STR of 10. It starts to work when the sneak gets to a useful level (around 25-30 I suppose) with HiPS from 21 and Terrifying from 24. One solution for pre-epic could be the use of weapons, hopefully with good ench bonus and extra damage, also get str gear for more damage (rapiers get 1,5x str bonus in the hands of a halfling, while still finessable), and of course heavy use of traps.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n EDIT:<br/>\n Okay, I made a version without concealment:<br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\n<br/>\n Barbarian(15), Rogue(24),

Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the effort hugely, but the \"why?\" question has to loom here somewhere, unless I'm missing something (which is highly likely). I saw your initial premise as a fascinating one, but the more you've refined it, the closer to a straight-up monk build it seems, just with lots of minuses and very few pluses. Do you just not like monks much, or are you particularly fond of non-lawful characters?<br/>\n<br/>\n Again, welcome on board - I hope you continue to challenge the Guild's thinking!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Here I picked Crippling strike and Epic skill focus intimidate.<br/>\n Your suggestion to max Taunt was tempting. And maybe it can be done the way you suggest. You swap a rogue feat for a fighter feat. I think that means that the epic skill focus must be taken at a general feat slot and EWF as a fighter bonus feat. That may effect the epic leveling order too, at least if you want an early EWF.<br/>\n I did put some effort into avoiding an xp penalty, but maybe it's not worth it here.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'm also sure, that better results could be achieved if we could drop the Barb levels.<br/>\n I just checked your two ideas. I also considered the CoT and Assassin classes... CoT gives great save bonuses, while gets the fighter bonus feats, and you have to worry less about XP penalties (well, to be honest as long as it is just a concept build, I could even forgive alignment changes on the Lawful-Chaotic axis, and XP penalty is even less of a problem). Assassin is less tempting, that 32 skillpoints in stealth hurts me too much if I dont use stealth at all... I like the Rogue variant with CoT levels better.<br/>\n<br/>\n Mick Dagger:<br/>\n At first I didn't thought about builds with just 15 Barb levels, and when I started to lower the Barb \"influence\" in the build I had other ideas (again, the dexer)... but hey, your build is strong, has 6d6 SA, and many feats. In the Human version I would consider some stealth, to make use of that SA. I would drop search, disable trap and lockpicking, and get set trap (I like traps very much :D) and stealth skills.
