Groans of the wounded lazed over the fog and smoke of the broken plains. Shrieks echoed in the distance of those who had been dragged away by the silent undead and now lie beyond the light of the burning debris. Each night the rotting damned would slink across the wasteland in uncountable hordes sniffing the air for living flesh. Despair and fear were as thick as the stench of the killing ground. The first of the darkness began to bleed into shapes that slithered across the blasted ground toward the flimsy fortifications. They were coming.<br/>\n<br/>\nA horn sounded. Not the terrifying wail of the enemy, but a clean, hopeful sound that cut through the despair hanging in the air. A beacon of light began to approach the walls. The figure was clad in black and red that threw the people into a panic. What new nightmare was this? Was this the end come to take us to our grave?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe knight slowed his horse at the foot of the thin walls and drew his sword, a vicious thing that glowed bloody in the failing light. Without a word he turned and galloped into the advancing horde alone; his horn sounding thunder and his sword slashing red ribbons against the darkness.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Death Hunter had found his prey.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Charisma-based character theme is that you have ability to utterly devastate any undead or evil creatures with the Smite ability or in the case of undead, Lay on Hands yet still hold your own when confronted with other foes.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladin(9), Cleric(7), Champion of Torm(24), Human, Lawful Good<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 15 (16)<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 14<br/>\nWIS: 12<br/>\nINT: 10<br/>\nCHA: 16 (27)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Paladin(1): Toughness, Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br/>\n02: Paladin(2)<br/>\n03: Paladin(3): Power Attack<br/>\n04: Cleric(1): CHA+1, Domains Trickery &amp; Sun, (CHA=17)<br/>\n05: Paladin(4)<br/>\n06: Paladin(5): Cleave<br/>\n07: Cleric(2)<br/>\n08: Cleric(3): CHA+1, (CHA=18)<br/>\n09: Champion of Torm(1): Extra Smiting<br/>\n10: Champion of Torm(2): Great Cleave<br/>\n11: Cleric(4)<br/>\n12: Paladin(6): CHA+1, Extra Turning, (CHA=19)<br/>\n13: Cleric(5)<br/>\n14: Champion of Torm(3)<br/>\n15: Paladin(7): Divine Might<br/>\n16: Champion of Torm(4): CHA+1, Improved Critical: Greatsword, (CHA=20)<br/>\n17: Champion of Torm(5)<br/>\n18: Paladin(8): Divine Shield<br/>\n19: Cleric(6)<br/>\n20: Cleric(7): CHA+1, (CHA=21)<br/>\n21: Champion of Torm(6): Epic Prowess, Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br/>\n22: Champion of Torm(7)<br/>\n23: Champion of Torm(8): Armor Skin<br/>\n24: Champion of Torm(9): CHA+1, Great Charisma I, (CHA=23)<br/>\n25: Champion of Torm(10): Epic Toughness I<br/>\n26: Champion of Torm(11)<br/>\n27: Champion of Torm(12): Great Charisma II, (CHA=24)<br/>\n28: Champion of Torm(13): CHA+1, (CHA=25)<br/>\n29: Champion of Torm(14): Great Smite I<br/>\n30: Champion of Torm(15): Great Smite II<br/>\n31: Champion of Torm(16)<br/>\n32: Champion of Torm(17): CHA+1, (CHA=26)<br/>\n33: Champion of Torm(18): Great Smite III, Great Smite IV<br/>\n34: Champion of Torm(19)<br/>\n35: Champion of Torm(20)<br/>\n36: Champion of Torm(21): STR+1, Great Smite V, (STR=16)<br/>\n37: Champion of Torm(22): Great Smite VI<br/>\n38: Champion of Torm(23)<br/>\n39: Paladin(9): Great Smite VII<br/>\n40: Champion of Torm(24): CHA+1, (CHA=27)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 526<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 47/39/37<br/>\nBAB: 28<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 35 (melee), 28 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 11/22<br/>\n<br/>\nSkillpoints: 129<br/>\nDiscipline 43(46), Spot 43(44), Taunt 42(50), remaining skillpoints 1<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Discipline(4), Taunt(4), Save(4), <br/>\n02: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(5), <br/>\n03: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(6), <br/>\n04: Save(9), <br/>\n05: Discipline(2), Taunt(2), Save(8), <br/>\n06: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(9), <br/>\n07: Save(12), <br/>\n08: Save(15), <br/>\n09: Discipline(3), Save(15), <br/>\n10: Discipline(1), Save(17), <br/>\n11: Save(20), <br/>\n12: Discipline(2), Taunt(6), Save(15), <br/>\n13: Save(18), <br/>\n14: Discipline(2), Save(19), <br/>\n15: Discipline(1), Taunt(3), Save(18), <br/>\n16: Discipline(1), Save(20), <br/>\n17: Discipline(1), Save(22), <br/>\n18: Discipline(1), Taunt(3), Save(21), <br/>\n19: Save(24), <br/>\n20: Save(27), <br/>\n21: Discipline(3), Save(27), <br/>\n22: Discipline(1), Save(29), <br/>\n23: Discipline(1), Save(31), <br/>\n24: Discipline(1), Save(33), <br/>\n25: Discipline(1), Save(35), <br/>\n26: Discipline(1), Save(37), <br/>\n27: Discipline(1), Save(39), <br/>\n28: Discipline(1), Save(41), <br/>\n29: Discipline(1), Save(43), <br/>\n30: Discipline(1), Save(45), <br/>\n31: Discipline(1), Save(47), <br/>\n32: Discipline(1), Save(49), <br/>\n33: Discipline(1), Save(51), <br/>\n34: Discipline(1), Save(53), <br/>\n35: Discipline(1), Save(55), <br/>\n36: Discipline(1), Save(57), <br/>\n37: Discipline(1), Save(59), <br/>\n38: Discipline(1), Save(61), <br/>\n39: Discipline(1), Taunt(21), Save(42), <br/>\n40: Discipline(1), Spot(43), remaining: (1)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Background, Analysis and Comments by Author</strong> <br/>\n<br/>\nEquipment<br/>\nFull Plate Armor<br/>\nGreatsword <br/>\n<br/>\nDeath Hunter Strengths<br/>\nAbility to score high damage per smites.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbility to kill any evil creatures with hefty amount of HP within 3 smites.<br/>\n<br/>\nSmite damage = average of 250 per smites.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan buff himself and can use some spells if memorized.<br/>\n<br/>\nHefty amount of HP (at level 40); can withstand high damages especially against dragons.
