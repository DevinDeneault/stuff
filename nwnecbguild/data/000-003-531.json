With DP your 4th attack will be at full AB vs -15 AB of the natural 4th attack. You do not even lose on the buffed AB side since DP will grant you +5 AB with 15 BAB vs +4 AB with 16 BAB. <br/>\n<blockquote><div>Any idea how much of barbarian to take?

Destruction lets you \"turn\" constructs (damage them via TU actually). Evil lets you turn outsiders and negative energy burst is not a bad spell. Death IMO is kinda meh.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding barbarian, I wouldn't take a single level. I'd go with rogue, say Cleric 19/Rogue 2. No matter what you pick, getting heavy on the cleric side is advisable.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

What this means is to use any prestige class at all in a 21 level-cap build the final split HAS to be 11/10 regardless of what PrC you choose.  So obviously, that rules out harper scout (&amp; PDK) on this server since it will never reach 10 levels.\n<blockquote><div>\nAnyway, i took yor first build with halfling upgrading it to the drow.

And if so, do you even care about an XP penalty?   <br/>\n<br/>\nIs this a server that uses PRC haks and overrides?<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO in a cleric Dex DWing semi caster build, which is somewhat bizarre to begin with, Magic domain is a waste.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf this is a true dexer, a domain where you can empower Cat's Grace is best (and BTW, I'd find a way to fit Empower spell in the feat list somewhere), like either War domain (with Aura of Vitality) or Animal domain (early True seeing) would have been worlds better than Magic.  Another way is too load your spell slots with Divine Power by taking Strength domain (includes Stoneskin).  It won't increase the AB (as long as your base Dex is at least 18), but it will give much more damage, more attacks per round and added HPs.  Magic Shield and Magic Vestment will do most of the AC boosting that Mage armor would have furnished and less dispellable.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou should have no problem with Darkness users if you slot enough Ultravision (or later, True Seeing).<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO a dual-wield dexing cleric is a huge mistake.  It is so feat-starved you will be forced to take several fighter levels to gain the needed feats to make the build playable.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, a question about this whole concept.  Why are you planning on a level 21-cap PC on a server where you can reach 40?  Maybe I missed this reason in the previous discussion so please repeat it if you already explained.

It uses some PRC things yes. But most of them no. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing with darkness is the following:<br/>\nit grants you sneak attack regardless if opponent has has true seeing or any other spell. I tried it out already, and...well. Iam sneaking even with people with true sight. So i will be always attacking with seven attacks per round (buffed, hasted) all of them sneaks. But builds with rogue, BG or assasin would sneak too on me. <br/>\n<br/>\nIts hard to pick up the right domain, as we have custom alchemy stuffs, doing the same as half of spells in domains. I decided to use items with dex to reach my dexterity permanenty being increased rather since it influences also my AC greatly, and the last few points if needed to buff on with potion. Magic armour will also help me on lower lvls greatly, items are a bit expansive to reach.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second domain i picked up from domains of the goddes (destruction, death, tricstery, evil). I rely i dont need to swap my first domain for another from these, hoping one of these would be enough but i cant say what runs in head of a man who controls bios/stories and such of chars. Invisibility is a must for a drow, if i am lurking somewhere, on surface for example, i cant really on potions, letting them to limit my possibilities if running out of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know how strange this build would be looking. I simple wanted something different, other than one of the common power builds usuall, which are all same there. And i like dual wielding, and dex based chars. I played Ultima online for years and no such thing there so now i am pushing it all the way  . I have fighter 4/rogue 9 char, it goes well but i am strucked as i am unable to get better items -- they cost too much and to make gold i need another better items. And cause  i am playing most time alone i try to connect this with cleric. If triple class was allowed i would pick up from 2 up to 4 fighter lvls for feats. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy 21st lvl? Well, most powerful drow are around 23. The most powerful chars are about 30+. It is hell to lvl up after 20th lvl, especially with drows ECL1-2. These companions are getting around 5-10 exps for hard npc. If you die, you loose almost whole lvl in experiences. For example, i died with my rogue on 13 lvl. I lost 4 thousends of xps. I was making them for four days, tiring<img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" />. The higher are you, the bigger loss, and you can loose your level if you fall under it. I plann to play together with my friend until he lvls up his char, and then to finish my rogue. There is a big chance i will stay by my cleric, since the rogue got boring, thanks to the stupid exp mechanic - 4 lvs between chars in party and our exps are strucked down at total minimum. If i decide to go on my cleric, I am thinking of 13/27 rogue/cleric version, with epic dodge, expertise (maybe improved expertise) and maxed dexterity, from spells protections and \"no save allowed\" things in attack. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes i could take empowered spell, since there is one free feat and i still not sure for what to take it.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

As a matter of fact, most of the modifications to the game used on the server are unusual to me since I never play PRC servers.  But I could still build if I know all the characteristics of the custom races, which are plentiful in PRC environments.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I am understanding about how domains are used on your server, are they linked to roleplay?  If that is the case, you should either post a link to the requirements or briefly describe each domain's relevance to the roleplay of the character you are playing.  I realize this may seem a bit complicated, but trust me, unless a PRC builder guru stops by, you will keep spinning your wheels rather than starting to play a good build.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like you feel that any higher than level 21 is too difficult and at that point you would probably either limit that character to pure roleplay or start another altogether.  Am I close to the true goal?<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, I really like that severe death penalty on the server.  My friends and I always play TRUE hardcore, where when you die, you are really dead.  That means, back to the character creation screen to try to build something that can actually survive.  Then the rest of the party must find easy places for you to level again.  We don't count lag death as an official death, however, or any other \"death by burping game\" causes.  I do enjoy serious hardcore, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nOkie doke, I'll give it some more thought with the additional server information you have provided and may have some usual suggestions.  Thanks for taking the time to explain it better.  I am sure others may need these sorts of details as well.  Stay tuned...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">An environment the likes of which I have no equal experience so you will need to apply just basic suggestions but modified according to the custom properties of the monsters and areas.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat did you intend to be your MAIN offensive power... dual-wield melee or casting?  This is important to even make one suggestion since if casting is intended for more than combat-enhancing buffs (with perhaps the occasional AoE disabler spell like HoG) then you will need to limit the emphasis on sneak damage and stealth and concentrate more on feats that will provide more casting power.  In that case, you would plan on at least 17 cleric levels (i.e. Cleric 17/Rogue 4) and more spell-related feats using rogue primary for dumps &amp; UD.  In this scenario, DWing would be a secondary, perhaps finishing offense and then pump Wis to get the highest DCs possible.  BTW, is Harm nerfed on your server?<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the other alternative would be a serious sneaker, w/cleric buffs and as many rogue bonus feats as possible (probably 2) like Crippling Strike, Defensive Roll, et al.  Epic Dodge will be impossible (assuming the Tumble 30/Dex 25 prereq is used on your server).  Just off the top of my head, a split like cleric 8/rogue 13 would get the most useful and best duration buffs and 7d6 sneaks with 2 rogue bonus feats. In this case, you would pump Dex and only set at Wis 14 for cleric buffs (DCs don't matter).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn either case, forget entirely about discipline because it can only cross-classed with these 2 classes.  10 points in that skill will be worthless because KDers &amp; Disarmers will typically have high strength so only a maxed discipline check will do any good.  Expect to be smacked around by owners of those two feats so you need to figure out a way to get right next to them,  The only way I know to elude all types of stealth checks and seers is Greater Sanctuary.  That is a level 6 cleric spell which requires at least 11 cleric levels and that brings us full circle back to the caster cleric with low-level sneaks, the first alternative and BTW, the one I would probably try.  Unless GS has also been nerfed, in which case, we have just proven that a 2-class dex sneaker cleric is a definite punching bag. <br/>\n<br/>\nUnderstand, I am flying by the seat of my pants on this.  I had a tough time trying to simulate how a starting common drow would allocate ability points.  Just to check whether my calculations were in the ballpark, please answer this question: is this starting ability split possible for a common drow - Str10/Dex16/Con13/Wis16/Int14/Cha8  ??  If not, I have no clue how to set up a starting PC for a PRC server and apologize for not being more helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nedit: I am convinced this idea is not a good one. <br/>\n<br/>\nClerics are feat-starved as are rogue.  You will either make a weak caster or a dex DWer with no good combat attacks like KD, Called Shot or Cleave and buffs which are geared better for a strength build than a dex one (eg. DP, Bull's).  <br/>\n<br/>\nEspecially with the stealthing weaknesses on the server you have described, the chief advantages of dexing is stealth and which according to you is not very effective.  DWing will also be ineffective.  You will have a total of 7 pre-epic and 1 epic feats.  Effective dex DWing requires Finesse, Ambidexterity, 2-Wpn Fighting &amp; Improved 2-Wpn Fighting.  That takes care of 4 of the 7 feats.  With the remaining 3 you'll need at least Blind Fight and Wpn Focus.  That leaves 1.  Improved Crit?  Extend Spend?  Combat Casting?  Knockdown? Just too many needs and too few feats.  I am assuming EWF for the 8th feat in epic, BTW.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo make cleric/rog even vaguely feasible at level 21 I would dump the DW build entirely to save 3 feats.  I would also drop the Dex idea, go with a strength build (saving 1 more feat, finesse) and use Divine power, Bull's Strength and Divine Favor to raise the BAB to fighter level.  A native pre-epic BAB of 15 is ideal for using DP. With all the feats saved you will have plenty of room to select good combat feats (like KD/IKD) and be able to use Greater Sanctuary to sneak up on enemies to KD them, even the stealthiest types.  Max Tumble, UMD, Conc, Spellcraft, Listen and if drow gives enough skills, also Spot.  I'd use a level-up sequence like Rog1/Clc2-7/Rog8/Clc9-12/Rog13/Clc14-19/Rog20 for pre-epic Rog4/Clc16 and finish of with Clc17 @Level 21.  The casting DCs with Wis in the 20-22 range will be high enough to be reliable and you should be able to get at least 2 spell-enhancement feats in the mix.  It won't matter which domains you choose because your cleric will be strong enough to dismantle most foes and you can use your favorite weapon to mop up while holding a shield for protection.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had considered a ranger/cleric as a dual-wielder dexer but the skills will be very limited (lose 1/2 of tumble &amp; UMD) though you would be able to max discipline to help avoid disarms and KDs.

But I don't view that as any problem since it is not a prestige class. Also, access to level 2 ranger spells will enhance your Dex-based skills though limiting you to light armor while using DW attacks.  However, you wouldn't need to use your general feats for DWing so there would be more flexibility than with rogue/cleric (and far superior BAB, of course).  Fighter class yields 1 more bonus feat in 9 levels but is unskilled.\n<blockquote><div>\nPlus he cant get uncanny dodge and if i am running it via STR i cant benefit from his dual wield.\n</div></blockquote>\nUD is only a product of 4 classes IIRC... barb, rogue, SD &amp; assassin but there is another option (see cleric/DwD).  <br/>\n<br/>\nMinimizing the DW penalties (making a good dual-wielder) is not related to a Dex build, only Weapon Finesse is.  There are as many DW strength builds out there as ones based on dexterity and they all do way more damage.  A ranger/cleric could be played either Str DW or Dex DW. In the rogue/cleric build the sneaks are a way to compensate for the low damage but only against those not immune to crits or sneaks.  Ranger uses Favored Enemies damage that can be tailored for those monster categories most commonly encountered in the environment and ignores those immunities.\n<blockquote><div>\nI am slowly giving it up. It seems hard to figure out working.\n</div></blockquote>\nYour request itself is \"exotic\" since it is based both on PRC and the other custom adjustments of the server you play on (like the dual-class cap).  If there IS a suitable build to uncover, it will not be easy to find.  Have patience. (I sense Kail reading, chuckling and shaking his head at the exasperation of a doomed venture, but I could be wrong  )\n<blockquote><div> <br/>\nWhen this happens, could you offer me some kind of exotic cleric way to play? If i would roll my cleric i would try to play something new.</div></blockquote>\nWell, a cleric11/Dwarven Defender10 would get Defensive Awareness which works exactly like Uncanny Dodge, access to Level 6 cleric spells, extremely hardy and would be quite \"exotic\" as a dual class combo.  But, once again... too feat-starved to make an effective dexing DWer like the rogue/cleric template.  And perhaps your server has no useful dwarf races?<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, given the extremely confining dual-class constraint, you must be willing to budge on your overall prerequisites enough to build something useful.  Let's summarize what it is you would like in this build:<br/>\n<ul><li>An \"exotic\" (i.e. uncommon) cleric dual-class combination with cap at level 21[/*:m]</li>\n<li>A finessing, dual-wield dexer[/*:m]</li>\n<li>Uncanny Dodge (or equivalent to maintain Dex AC under stress)[/*:m]</li>\n<li>Highly-skilled for stealth and detection (although it appears you are willing to discard this requirement at this time)[/*:m]</li>\n<li>Effective melee attack (using reliable combat skills like KD, Cleave or other sure-fire methods of controlling hostiles)[/*:m]</li>\n<li>A cleric with reliable offensive casting capabilities[/*:m]</li>\n<li>Maximize the use of PRC races and classes, cleric gods or goddesses, etc. unique to the server [/*:m]</li></ul>[/list]<br/>\nI hope I have captured the most significant prerequisites you had in mind.  If not, amend the list accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best procedure I've found to prioritize such a list is to number them according to which are most important (1 through \"x\") and re-list them using that sequence. Then, start at the top and begin to plan any build combination that utilizes each requirement, one-by-one, until the permutations have been exhausted, checking off each item on the list from top to bottom.  You should find that some of the requirements nearest the end of the list are unchecked, unattainable and you will have reached the best possible compromise.  \"Compromise\" is the key word here. It may seem complicated, but with practice it gets easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are not going anywhere here at the ECB so stick with it and we may be able uncover what you need.  BTW, any of your playmates who have building ideas may have something useful to contribute pertaining to the server you play on.  It would be great if they would join the ECB to add ideas to a discussion like this.  Something to think about.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Plus the value of rogue UMD may have also turned the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis fighter combo has some promise.  You will likely not be a very effective stealther so will need to use cleric abilities to compensate to some extent.  Your feat distribution seems pretty good.  Consider Blight Fight as a requirement, especially if there are shadows and other concealed foes to deal with.  I think you are on a good path with the 14 cleric giving you level 7 spells.  If you want to increase your casting DCS, boost Wis.  If you want higher AB/damage, boost Str. But I wouldn't spread it out.  You get 5 ability bumps, so could place 4 in Str and the odd one in either Wis (DC/slot) or Int (for about 20 more skill points).  Or you place all 5 in Wis to create more slots and the highest DCs for a cleric 14.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMy preference is to place all in Wis to get the modifier to +6, gain additional slots at slvl 4, 5 &amp; 6 and increase DCs by 3.  Between Divine Power, Divine favor and other buffs, AB &amp; damage should be very good.  Combined with IKD, this should be a dangerous fellow.  You may want to opt for an offhand weapon one size smaller than your PC race to avoid the penalties.  It won't look as \"cool\" but will hit more often on both hands, even without the weapon foci.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsually, spell focus feats have the greatest up side.  But with only 21 levels, Spell Penetration may be more effective.  I would still advise Combat Casting to prevent interrupted spells while being pounded.  But that is more of a play style issue than a rule of thumb.  Obviously, you won't need that feat for buffing so you are the one to decide which will be most useful.  Some of more useful spells that can be empowered would be Aid (HPs), Bull's (AB/damage), Cat's (AC/saves), Owl's (DCs), Endurance (HPs/saves), the offensive spells HoG, Slay Living, Flame Strike, Doom Circle, Inflict wounds as well as cure spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, your SR break is not all that bad.  If you set the d20 average to 10, the config you described would 10+16 = 26, an SR which is pretty high for most monsters, though your server may have added uber high SRs to them.  In cases where there are insane monster SRs and immunities on a server, the choice is simple:  don't play a caster! <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother reason I had suggested ranger as an alternative was that the Dex requirement could be quite low (as low as 8) for a DW  strength build so they can concentrate on other abilities.  Some rangers set Dex at 13 to get Dodge even when going the strength route if considering Mobility &amp; Spring Attack.  But with the limitations of dual-class cap, this direction really isn't feasible.  I am not trying to \"sell\" ranger, just point out a few of the benefits that you might file away for the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll be interested to see the fully fledged build 1-21 when you have it hashed out. (BTW, I DL'd the character creator from the PRC download site, but without PRC installed, it only creates vanilla characters.   It is handy though, so I will probably continue to use it.)<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. I like Kail's idea as well if you don't mind being limited to kamas.  Just a little dab will do ya with monk levels!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Generally, negative immunity should negate the effect of Harm just as positive immunity should protect from Heal.  But I think Harm is sometimes altered by the server.  I know I played on at least one server where there was no protection from Harm except the specific immunity from the Harm spell itself and in that case was a property on an equippable item.  \n<blockquote><div>\nI know what are yu trying to say with ranger. \u00a8But if i am not going for dexterity, i wont have AC. If i go for heavy armour, it cancelns my dual wield feats. NO AC or no dual wield.\n</div></blockquote>\nYou got it.  The reference was in regard to still trying to find an answer to your original dexer DW cleric request.  Just like monk, the armor restrictions directly affect how the class performs so if you are settled on heavy armor those choices are not suitable. \n<blockquote><div>\nSo you think this combination has some real chances? I worry just my low AC around 37-40. Will be it enough to withstand a fighter?

Don't forget, you can enhance both your armor and shield with the long-duration Magic Vestment for an additional +8AC  (+4ACx2 @ Cleric 12) against a hard hitter.  At least +4AC (armor only buff) while DWing.  Until you find a +4 deflection item you can also use Shield of Faith for another +4AC.   But just with Vestment x1 41-44(DW)/x2 45-48(SW) is not bad at all for a level 21 PC.<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, the easiest way to neutralize a hard-hitter is to drop it with IKD.  While it is prone, your AC doesn't matter. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith all the good feats, this should be a formidable PC for many environments, especially when you buff up those shortswords (each one separately, naturally) with Darkfire.  Any way you can use the cleric AoE effects to make it easier are a plus.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Don't depend on that feature when playing on other servers that have not changed the rules in a similar fashion.  I have never played a module or on a server that allowed either Harm or Heal to be cast spontaneously.  They must be memorized.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to your question about Harm and immunity, yes, Kail has confirmed that negative immunity will negate Harm effects unless the server has redefined the damage type of Harm to be another damage type.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
