In the end, I decided on this and I couldn't be happier about it as everything comes rapidly one after the other, Dev Crit at level 24, all AB-boosters by level 27, then EMA which is so important for freeing up slots for immunity items, then Auto Still for casting in full plate armor and finally, as a capstone ability, Epic Warding.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/runes-desolation-wizard-26-fighter-6-divine-champi-t2355263.html#p17943\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Runes &amp; Desolation <br/>\n</a><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/spellsword-of-bahamut-sorc-26-paladin-4-rdd-10-t515415.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Spellsword of Bahamut <br/>\n</a></details>\nEdit by Mick Dagger: * and ** swapped feats to make the build legal.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Most often they are builds that share the same classes and class levels. <br/>\nSometimes it may also be of interest to compare with other builds with similar features. They can be harder to find when searching.

So a solution is to reverse EWF and dev crit in this build.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Have checked that I've selected all of the prereqs and it all checks out. Am I missing something here?\u00a0</div></blockquote>\nWell, Dev Crit certainly is a CoT bonus feat - unless Blackstone has altered that - but I suspect it's an issue of Great Strength. While the usual stat boosts at 4, 8, 12, etc apply at the level you take them, you have to wait until after you've levelled up <em>before</em> the feats you take apply. So you won't be able to access Dev Crit until at least L25. So Val, alas, got it a bit wrong in his levelling, but it's an easy one to solve: take EWF at L24, and Dev Crit at L25.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that makes sense!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

While I'm here, I'll mention that I'm playing this as an elf with the Bladeweaver option that you can take just after character creation (specific to BSK). Had to take a major hit to CON and sacrifice a feat to take exotic as bladeweaver uses katana. There is an easy relevelling process which has come in really handy in this situation. I'm trying to decide which general feat to forgo with empower or extend spell being the options I have in my sights. Any recommendations welcome. The build is holding up well. I've been resorting to using a lot of scrolls which has been working, but I'm really looking forward to the auto stills. Time to go relevel and dish out some dev crits.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I like this build so much that I plan to run it through Swordflight, in occasion of chapter 5 being recently released. I only ran martial characters so far, because I've always been worried about the module's rest restrictions for spellcasters, but this wizard here can kick some serious ass in melee. I finished SF 1 easily and I'm now at the beginning of SF 2.<br/>\n<br/>\nI plan to make a few changes though, and I'm happy to hear opinions on them.<br/>\n1) I will do F4/CoT10 (F3/CoT 9 pre-epic), as already suggested earlier in this thread. I will replace Weapon Specialization for Luck of Heroes, This should give me +2/+3/+3 to saves. Swordflight is a tough module :-)<br/>\n2) I also want to fit Toughness in the build. I'm unsure if I should drop Greater Spell Penetration or Empower Spell. For most of the playtime (i.e., until Auto Still 2 -- and that will take MANY fights to reach, Swordflight has fairly slow progress with tough fights at every level) this character plays like a Fighter with Wizard buffs. So I'm guessing Greater Spell Penetration will not be as important. On the other hand, I don't want to miss out on being able to use some offensive spells after Auto Still, and it seems to me that the main benefit for Empower Spell will be the empowered stat buffing spells (but it is fairly easy to cap +STR with a regular Bull's Strength in Swordflight, beginning around level 20). Any thoughts on this? I have never played a caster outside HotU so I don't have a good sense of the utility of these feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I end up dropping Greater Spell Penetration, does it make sense to keep Spell Penetration, or should I drop that one as well?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor skills, I may decide to drop Spot and rely on AoE/familiars/summons/occasional Gem of True Sight (very, very expensive in Swordflight) to keep me alive until I get Level 6 spells to cast my own True Sight. This will alllow me to either get some cross-class Persuade, or high Lore, which is occasionally useful for skill checks that give some XP.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for posting this build :-)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
