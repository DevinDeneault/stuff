Got the Cha up to 20 which when capped at 32, will allow an 11 round Divine Might duration in zen archer form, bear, water elemental or dragon forum.\u00a0<br/>\nI worried a little about the base AB of 36 but its only in archer form, and can be boosted by Owl's Insight, easily adding +6 to the value. Should be able to hit them at least a little.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Did a bit more tinkering<br/>\n<br/>\nI figured with the high wisdom score from needing to get Dragon Shape, I may as well try to bump up cleric levels rather than just use a single level cleric cheese for Divine Might.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a result its a stronger divine zen archer with divine power, divine favor (erm up to 18 casts of Divine Favor / extended Divine Favor), bless, aid, prayer, eagles splendor admittedly some of these goodies come late. Meta magic is good for extended and empowered. Cleric buffs unfortunately can be dispelled. It loses spell penetration and Mord resistance sadly. WoG players will love GMW and Darkfire for their crossbow and crossbow bolts. It gets crossbow attacks faster<br/>\n<br/>\nWith two divine spell books you can pretty much cast unlimited summons to tank piles of damage whilst you shoot em with divine damage crossbow damage, up to 5 attacks per round with DP and haste. If they dont have spell resistance throw in a few SoVs, Stone Holds and grease for disables as well<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you run out of spells, just turn into a dragon to finish em off<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway this is how it looks. Druid 9 spells with undispellability, Cleric 8 spells. Only space for monk cheese at level 40 sadly. Not sure about the domains. Maybe healing to synergise with druid heal spells. Or Strength for extra divine power casts. The level 39 feat could be anything you want, toughness is good, as is scribe scroll/craft wand, Maximise wouldn't be bad either, or silent/still spell for extra flexibility in spell management<br/>\n<br/>\nI love how this build looks by the way. Its like a dual spell caster with buffed zen archery power, melee power (with Druid polymorphs) and a final topping of monk cheese at the end<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Druid(24), Monk(1), Cleric(15), Human\nSTR: 14\nCON: 8\nINT: 12\n\n01: Druid(1): Power Attack, Point Blank Shot\n03: Cleric(2): Divine Might\n05: Druid(2)\n07: Druid(4)\n09: Druid(6): Rapid Reload\n11: Druid(8)\n13: Druid(10)\n15: Druid(12): Extend Spell\n17: Druid(14)\n19: Druid(16)\n21: Cleric(5): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=22)\n23: Druid(18)\n25: Druid(20)\n27: Druid(22): Great Wisdom III, (WIS=25)\n29: Cleric(6)\n31: Cleric(8)\n33: Cleric(10): Great Wisdom V, (WIS=29)\n35: Cleric(12)\n37: Cleric(13)\n39: Cleric(15): Great Charisma I, (CHA=17)\n\nSkillpoints: 228\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +2, Fear: +2\nAB (max, naked): 28 (melee), 36 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: \nCleric(8)\n\n\n\n01: Animal Empathy(1), Concentration(4), Disable Trap(1), Lore(4), Open Lock(1), Search(2), Set Trap(2), Spellcraft(1), Save(2),\u00a0\n03: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1),\u00a0\n05: Concentration(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Spellcraft(1),\u00a0\n07: Concentration(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n09: Concentration(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Save(10),\u00a0\n11: Concentration(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Save(16),\u00a0\n13: Concentration(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Save(22),\u00a0\n15: Concentration(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Save(28),\u00a0\n17: Concentration(1), Set Trap(1), Save(36),\u00a0\n19: Concentration(1), Set Trap(1), Save(44),\u00a0\n21: Concentration(1), Set Trap(1), Save(48),\u00a0\n23: Concentration(1), Save(58),\u00a0\n25: Concentration(1), Save(68),\u00a0\n27: Concentration(1), Save(78),\u00a0\n29: Concentration(1), Save(86),\u00a0\n31: Concentration(1), Save(92),\u00a0\n33: Concentration(1), Save(98),\u00a0\n35: Concentration(1), Save(104),\u00a0\n37: Concentration(1), Save(112),\u00a0\n39: Concentration(1), Save(118),\u00a0</details>\n<br/>\n<strong>Edit: </strong>made some adjustments to make it an elf with rapid shot.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n\u00a0Lots of modules will have bonus stuff for elven archers.
