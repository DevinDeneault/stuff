Ever since I became a builder, I have always been pretty upset by their very weak builds, skill and feat choices. The Bioware staff created a game, but now NWN has evolved into a whole different game, so it's time to show some love to these great characters that walked side by side with us in our Neverwinter Nights infancy. I'll post all of my henchmen rebuilds here for comments, but I want to make it very clear that the goal is not to make them what they were originally, but to somehow give them worthy builds (yes, POWERBUILD for them) while still keeping faithful to their great stories.<br/>\n<br/>\n The first one is the outcast of the Uthgardt tribes, Daelan Red Tiger, who managed to prove himself to his people by finding a sacred item in chapter 3. He became a champion to them, so I will make him a Barbarian / Champion of Kord (which should be read Champion of Torm, because it's the only god that has a champion, apparently, all the others would be too much work to create, or just add a feature that replaced the name Torm with the god of your choice). Anyway, He was always very well-spoken, articulate and calm, so I gave him 14 INT, and being so, and also a good-hearted soul, he could very well have joined the Harpers and represented them among the Uthgardt tribes. So Harper Scout was the third class (obviously, for a full Tumble skill, bonus feats, and Create Harper Item), but it does fit him thematically. Now this Daelan packs a punch. He has Terrifying Rage, ESF Intimidate, Taunt and Discipline, wields his famous Double Axe, has very high saves for a Barbarian, but lowish HP, as I only managed to fit 14 CON to the build. He doesn't have UMD, but can make Cat's Grace and Bull's Strength potions and wear a Chain Shirt. His AC is low, but any 2-hander will suffer from that. I could've made him with 16 CON and 12 INT, but then he wouldn't be Daelan, just some default Half-Orc Barbarian.<br/>\n<br/>\n Well, finally, I present you: Daelan Red Tiger!<br/>\n<br/>\n

Discipline, Intimidate with ESF in all three, which makes him very hard to KD / Disarm (if at all possible), and also very hard to resist his Terrifying Rage and his Taunts. He will have a once-per-day +7 to AB and Damage against tough bosses with Divine Wrath, plus Bull's Strength and Barbarian Rage to make sure STR is capped and CON goes up a notch too, and 6 attacks per round (7 if Hasted). His weaknesses are the lack of UMD, lowish HP and low AC (although on WoG less so than anywhere because of the existance of Shield bracers). You may consider dropping Blind Fight or Improved Knockdown for Improved Expertise just to give him a bit of occasional AC, but I'd just keep him this way. AB and damage should be tremendous when fully buffed (Rage + DW).<br/>\n<br/>\n Just a little note: Champion of Kord is Champion of Torm in-game.<br/>\n<br/>\n I hope you like him. Feel free to comment on him, but he has been done and revised many times, so he should be very good as he is now, at least for where he was designed to be played.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
