      "content": "<div>Hi guys,<br/>\n<br/>\nHope ya'll well.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, been on this forum for a while and checked many of your smashing builds, but because of my lack of building knowledge I never posted anything myself (hopefully, yet) so I just wanna say hi to all of you and hope you could help me with my build requests. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm mainly playing on NWN:EE ADoH Land of Nordock server and as usually my \"friends\" are playing at different time than me, I started wishing to have a character that will have his own company at all time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I have in mind is, I want to have a toon with as many animal companions as possible. Perfectly if they will not disappear after rest. For that I was thinking to make a build with Ranger/Druid mixed with Wizard classes, and the reason I'm asking here is because I have found nothing like that here on the forum.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>1) PvM or PvP</strong> - Definitely PvM\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>2) Level cap</strong> - 40<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>3) Race preference</strong> - Human or Elf please. On the server I'm playing we have couple subraces for both that maybe will be helpful in building the character. They can be found <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.adawnofheroes.com/free-subraces\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>4) Class preference</strong> - As mentioned earlier. I was thinking about Ranger/Druid and Wizard build to have companions from them. One level of Shadowdancer could be also added for hide in plain sight if you guys will think that would be a good feat to have for this build. So basically, I'm open with every single possible option.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>5) Melee preference</strong> - No preferences.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>6) Range preference</strong> - DEX archery or Zen Archery (WIS) - I will go with anything. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>7) Weapon preference</strong> - Well, this probably will be a caster build, right? So anything that will be clicking with the build. But if I would need to say what's my favorite weapon, I would say - longbow.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>8) Maximum item enhancement</strong> - If I'm correct the most powerful basic items are +5, but I know that if I would spend with this toon 20 years I will\u00a0 be able to collect or needed tokens to enter something like an epic shot where you can have +6 items.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>9) Spellcasting</strong> -\u00a0 If I'm wright I will need spells to buff my pets/companions and myself? Maybe some Improved Invisibility or some distance hurting spells?\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>10) Custom factors</strong> - Not that many but all minor changes can be found below:<br/>\n<br/>\na) <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.adawnofheroes.com/feats-changes\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Feats changes</a><br/>\nb) <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.adawnofheroes.com/spells-changes\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Spells changes</a><br/>\nc) <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.adawnofheroes.com/summons-changes\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Summons changes</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all\u00a0 in advance for any build suggestions and help. Will appreciate every support.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nKuyav</div>"

      "content": "<div>Well, the main problem with what you want to do is that Animal Companions are tied to levels of the Caster who has them.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeaning that for a Druid's Animal Companion (and Ranger) it's levels are determined by the level of the Class itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same goes for a Wizard's (or Sorc)\u00a0 Familiar.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, because one only has a max of 40 levels, if one went (this is an example) Ranger/Druid/Sorcerer, for example, all the companions/familiars are going to be very low a level OR one is going to to be higher than the others.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt doesn't work out very well.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor your example, I would go almost pure Druid, with Animal Companion, Summons, and then grab any available animal or magical beast that one can with Animal Empathy.\u00a0 That would be 3 \"party members\" - though the summons will not last long.\u00a0 Taking the Epic Mummy summons will, of course, solve that problem.</div>"

      "content": "<div>So, for most of your other requests - <br/>\n<br/>\nGo Elf for the Longbow (Elves get Longbow automatically).\u00a0 You'll want to go Druid here - and it depends on what kind of Druid you really want to be, but I would suggest going for Dragon Shape.\u00a0 It is very powerful.<br/>\n<br/>\nPick up Zen Archery along the way - that will make your Longbow skills awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would heartily suggest the build World Ender, by GDL.\u00a0 It is, quite simply, a beast.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-world-ender-druid-32-fighter-2-monk-6-t2355416.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the-world-ender-druid-32-fighter-2-monk-6-t2355416.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThat should basically having you ROFLStomp just about anything that dares look at you cross-eyed.\u00a0 It is simply a real CoDzilla.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow go thank the Dwarflord for giving us this monstrosity.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hey Kuyav! I have some playing experience on ADoH (technically I'm a DM there, but I haven't had consistent play time for months now), so I might be able to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first thing to consider on ADoH, are the changes that have been made to Summons' in the form of level scaling. Level IX and Epic Spell Summons receive a 'buff' at levels 21/26/31/36/40 of specific caster classes (Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard). This means that 'pure casters' have access to the most potent summons.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second thing to consider is that Druids can summon both a Epic and level IX summon simultaneously once they hit 21 caster levels, and Clerics/Sorcerers/Wizards can do so once they hit 36 caster levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, it's worth noting that the server is generally 'high magic'. Item quality on ADOH is very high (generally +6/+7 at end game,with a lot of additional boosts depending on your class , via 'set bonuses'), end-game weapons can have an awful lot of extra damage added to them via Socket Gems , and a lot of enemies have various forms of Damage Reduction/Resistance/Immunity. Meanwhile, Dragon Shape AB and damage are left at vanilla level, which makes them decent as tanks, but not very capable of dishing out melee damage. 'Offensive' Dragon builds tend to utilise other classes to boost AB, such as Barbarian dragons (Rages have been tweaked).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo given this information: <br/>\n<br/>\n- Are you after 'the strongest summoner build possible'? If so, pure 40 cleric or wizard is probably your best choice, as they have access to decent buffs, a flexible spellbook (which is nice if you're new to a server), and Greater Sanctuary if sh*t hits the fan. Pure 40 Druid gets access to a rather highly buffed Animal companion in addition to 2 decent summons ... but they lack defensive capability if they get cornered. Which will happen a LOT if you venture into claustrophobic high level dungeons on ADOH.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Are you after 'the build that gets access to the most amount of pets'? If so, then you'll want a build with a minimum of 21 Druid, 6 Ranger, and 1 Wizard levels. Something like 32 Druid/6 Ranger/2 Wizard would fulfil this role, however it would have very weak summons in comparison to a pure caster, as well as having similar issues to a pure Druid, i.e. next to no defensive capabilities. At the very least, the Wizard levels would allows it to use Greater Sanctuary scrolls.<br/>\n<br/>\n-\u00a0 Do you just want to roll a 'decent Druid build'? If so, then probably pure 40 Druid or 36 Druid/at least 1 Monk/maybe some Rogue is probably the way to go. The 'monk' version can potentially fall back onto Dragon Shape if they need to tank (again, Dragon Shape isn't very good offensively in comparison to bog standard melee builds on ADOH), but will have slightly weaker summons at level 40. I'd personally recommend the Druid36/Monk/X version if you want to take this angle, as they are a lot of fun to play. Especially with a group of friends! :)</div>"
