      "content": "<div>A short question regarding critical hits :<br/>\n<br/>\nIs the Crit Roll (when a crit is actually threatened) done from the highest AB, or from the current AB where the threatened crit has occured?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Wiki is not concise here :<br/>\n<blockquote><div>This threat roll is made the same way as the original attack roll (with the same modifiers)</div></blockquote>\n\nWhat I mean is, say a particular character has perfect BAB - 30.\u00a0 That means that (without having Monk progression here) this character has 4 Attacks/Round, each further attack at -5 AB (not considering extra attacks here from Haste, TWF, ITWF, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if a Crit is threatened, say, on the 3rd attack here, does it use the AB from the highest AB, or from the AB of the 3rd attack (meaning in this case, a malus of -15 to the highest AB)?</div>"

      "content": "<div>It's all a matter of sequencing. First, you have to hit your target (the BAB/AB element). Then you get the crit threat applied. So in theory you stand a better chance of landing one on your first attack in a round, as that's the one most likely to hit. However, as we all know, dice are bastards. Thus, you may roll a 1 or 2 in your first two attacks and miss. Then you roll an 18 and a hit ensues - hoorah! The chance of that being a critical one is the same as if you'd hit with your first two attacks. The chances of landing a critical hit are not reduced once you have actually landed a hit, regardless of when it falls in the flurry.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that makes some sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

      "content": "<div>No, it is not making sense, or I am not understanding it!<br/>\n<br/>\nLet us go back to my example :<br/>\n<br/>\nThis character ONLY has 30 AB - no bonuses, whatsoever other than 1/1 BAB Class (like Fighter).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the 3rd attack (from 4, right?) is at -10 here (30, 25, 20) so is AB 20.\u00a0 If it is a natural 20 (crit, roll a crit threat roll), what does the crit threat roll ADD to it's chance to crit here?\u00a0 is it 30 from the highest AB, or is it 20 from the 3rd hit?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf 20, then the chance of the crit actually taking place is lower, right?\u00a0 Because it still needs to reach target AC to actually do crit damage (successful crit threat roll).</div>"

      "content": "<div>Using your example, let's say that your AB progression is +30 / +25 / +20, including BAB, STR, feats, other modifiers, etc. To simplify things let's also assume that your threat range is just 20.<br/>\nOn your third attack (20 AB) if you roll a 20 for your attack roll then you will threaten a critical. This happens even if your natural 20 attack misses due to Epic Dodge or if your opponent is immune to critical hits, but it does not happen if you miss due to concealment.<br/>\nImmediately after rolling a 20 on your attack roll you will then make a threat roll using the same AB as your attack roll (20 AB). Your threat roll must match or beat the target's AC in order to confirm a critical hit. For the threat roll a 1 is not automatically a non-crit and a 20 is not automatically a critical hit.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's assume that you roll a\u00a0 1 on your threat roll but your target has 21 AC or less. Your combat log will read:<br/>\nwebshaman1 attacks Enemy : *critical hit* : (20 + 20 = 40 : Threat Roll: 1 + 20 = 21)<br/>\nWe can break this down as (ATTACK DIE + AB = X : Threat Roll: THREAT DIE + AB = Y), where the AB is the same in both cases which I believe answers your original question.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that in this example if your opponent had 41 AC then you would not be able to land a critical hit with your third attack, since even a 20 on your threat roll would not match the 41 needed to confirm the critical hit.<br/>\nSo unless your AB is either significantly higher or significantly lower than your target's AC, the chance of landing a critical hit is not the same for all of your attacks.</div>"
