So, I came here)<br/>\n<br/>\n Alright, so the name of the game is Arelith.<br/>\n 1) PvM or PvP: I suppose I'd want it to mainly focus on PvM, however, if it can be twisted to be 'okay'ish in a PvP situation all the better.<br/>\n 2) Level 30 Cap.<br/>\n 3) Race Preference. Elf<br/>\n 4) Classes Considered and why... Ranger, Wizard, AA, Fighter, Rogue Now, I would like to role-play a Ranger, but I didn't know if I would need to also put them into AA to be somewhat viable (although I love the idea of Arcane Archer and wouldn't mind it that much myself if it was benefical to Ranger) Without it, I can't seem to find the good balance on my own to not do ...5-6 damage per round (which is good at low levels, but... at 30's? Not so much)<br/>\n 5) Melee? Possibly dual wield, but this isn't such a big deal.<br/>\n 6) Dex Based, Archery is probably the best. (Suggestions otherwise are always welcome)<br/>\n 7) I would enjoy using a Longbow the most<br/>\n 8) Max enchant? I don't know, I hear some ideas can give +4 to some stats (artefacts), but they are rare. HOWEVER! Items can boost stats so say you have 23 Dex by level 30. You can boost tunics, rings, (possibly weapons) to give you +1 in any stat (to about +8 or 9) Also, works on skills so I hear, however, the more stats the more risk of the item blowing up in your face (trying to enchant it further, meaning destroyed)<br/>\n 9) Not necessary, in Arelith the Ranger can become an AA without the required Arcane levels put in (but it needs to meet the rest of the requirements)<br/>\n 10) See Note 8 about some changes. However, some class changes have taken effect I will list them at the end for reference.<br/>\n<br/>\n Forbidden classes (Without a lot of other requirements met, RP or otherwise):<br/>\n Assassin<br/>\n Harper Scout<br/>\n Pale Master<br/>\n Red Dragon Disciple<br/>\n Shifter<br/>\n Purple Dragon Knight<br/>\n<br/>\n Paths of the Ranger available to taking upon creationArcherRangers on Arelith can choose the Archer path. Such rangers lose the feats Dual-wield and Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, but can craft a bundle of iron arrows at ranger level 1, a bundle of steel arrows at ranger level 5, and a bundle of damask arrows at ranger level 10.Instead of the AC bonus at level 6, they gain +1 of damage to ranged attacks. At 14, they gain +3. This damage can not be reduced.<br/>\n<br/>\n The Sniper path is an alternate archer path for rangers. Snipers lose the dual wield feats but get point blank shot and rapid shot at level 1 and called shot at level 9.Instead of the AC bonus at level 6, they gain +1 of damage to ranged attacks. At 14, they gain +3. This damage can not be reduced.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Changes to Ranger, Regarding AA.</strong><br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Ranger\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ranger</a> does not have to fulfill the NWN Requirement of arcane Spellcasting when multiclassing to Arcane Archer. Therefore any Ranger can take levels in the Arcane Archer class without taking any levels in the Wizard, Bard or Sorcerer classes. He must still fulfill all other requirements for the class.<br/>\n<br/>\n Any help is appreciated, and if I didn't answer something that does indeed need to be answered beforehand, I would be happy to make a response.<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Don't know how it will turn out, but since you lose all your dual wield feats, I would assume I just single hand it, yes? Maybe a shield with it? Or would that get a negative?\u00a0 Multi-classing no longer incurs a XP penalty, the same way armor no longer reduces overall speed. I think it fits, but if you Hipredux have any suggestions (skills, or feat changes) feel free to tell me ^^.
