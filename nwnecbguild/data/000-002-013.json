      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">...but a curious idiot, I was looking through Ye Olde Forgotten Reams wiki when my eye was caught by the Forest Gnome (there are reasons, but I'm not telling). Now, it struck me that such a creature would be more likely to be a Druid than a Wizard, and being a shy type, probably a SD for HiPS. And thus a whole RP character began to form in that idiotic but imaginative area between my ears (you may well see its outpourings in the Build Request forum sometime soon).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was around then that I remembered I'd never built a Druid before, at least not a caster one (there were a couple with a few levels just for Shifter). Thus, here I am with a couple of questions (at least to start with). But first, some givens: no Dragon Shape; there will be at least 1, but probably 2, minor class(es) involved, so no telling me to play a pure one this time; and it will be a gnome, which I appreciate isn't necessarily the best race.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the questions: i) while I appreciate that Conjuration is well-regarded as the prime school - mostly for Implosion and SoV, Evocation appeals as druidic for the elemental stuff, and so does Abjuration for the same reason - druidic in nature, though not so elemental. Would I be over-gimping myself by taking one of the latter two? ii) Blind Fight, is it still worth it - ditto for KD (assuming IKD is less needed when shifting into animal/elemental form)? iii) Do all creature weapons react positively to Imp Crit: Unarmed while ignoring WF/EWF, or is that just dragon form? iv) How does Weapon Finesse work when in wildshape/ elemental form, or is it unnecessary?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will, I'm sure, be more later, but in the meantime, any advice is appreciated from the ever-helpful Guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Great idea! \"How to build a druid\" happens to be one of my favourite topic NWN. To your questions:<br/>\n1. You take Spell Focus to increase the DC of spells of the chosen school that offer a save. Conjuration focus is good on Druids because their area control spells (Grease, Web, Stonehold, SoV) are improved by it (as well as Bombardment I guess). Evocation is also good, you improve the DC of Flame Strike and Fire Storm and Call Lightning and Sunburst and Earthquake and whatnot. Abjuration looks bad, as Druid has _zero_ spells of this school that care about saves. Another school to consider is Transmutation (Drown! Nature's Balance! Cool Druid-only spells!)<br/>\n2. Druid shapes (except maybe Dragon, which you are not taking) have _really bad_ AC. If you want to fight shifted at all, I think you need a way to fix that, and there is mostly only one (assuming your WIS will be high) and that is dip into Monk. Assuming you don't want to do this, I suggest forgetting shapes and thinking of fighting in gnome form, kind of like a Cleric with much worse AB, better defenses, one more companion, and incapacitated enemies. So yes you can take the usual melee feats if you so desire.<br/>\n3. Weapon Finesse works when shifted, as do IC, as does Epic Prowess, and WF/EWF do not work. But you probably should not plan on shifting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am happy to discuss further, as I said I like the topic very much.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

So, I'm wondering whether throwing a few levels of CoBW (Champion of Baervan Wildwanderer, though I'm not sure whether a dire badger or rat better substitutes for the raccoon Chiktikka Fastpaws) would be handy - to cover 1 or 2 feats pre-epic, help boost gnome-form combat, and bolster Wisdom in epic levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings begin to coagulate in my idiocy!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, here's another question before moving along: do Druids get/have to chose a domain or two like Clerics do (and I'm ignoring WoG-isms here, where I know you play)?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

She was only a little person (under 5ft, or 150cm), and I began - with my burgeoning irreverence - calling her a gnome from being about 14 (plus she had great crafting skills - head of art and design for over 40 years as a teacher). She was also passionate about nature - flora and fauna - so when I say 'she wouldn't hurt a fly', she really wouldn't. She reserved her hatred for those who wantonly destroyed the environment (when she looked like a vexed baby eagle). So I was looking to make a tribute build.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere, that's the soppy bit out of the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow then, to the construction. If I was going for a human or half-elf, Monk would have been a no-brainer. But I'm not, because as a module player I don't want the xp hit (wouldn't even work with Hin). By the same token, when thinking of a third class, Ranger appealed, but same problem. Hence the CoT consideration. At the moment I'm contemplating either a D32/ CoT 6/ SD2 or a D36/ CoT 2/ SD2, so please don't lose sleep about the gnome of hittiness!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
