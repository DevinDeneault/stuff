Their Champion had received a challenge from an outsider, and they were all too excited to see blood spilt in the name of honour. They gathered in their numbers to witness the fight, clamouring over each other to better gain a vantage point from which to view the spectacle.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n The Orcish Grand Champion lumbered forward, shoulders hunched. Easily at least 8 feet tall and 5 feet wide, he was massive, even for an orc. An axe with a doubled bladed head the size of a dwarf was slung casually over his shoulder. He raised it with one hand and let out a roar, which boomed and resonated off of the caven walls. He was enthusiastically echoed by his fellow clansmen, blood boiling and ready for gore.<br/>\n<br/>\n The challenger stepped forward. He presented a shorter figure than his orcish counterpart, but his stance and presentation radiated the confidence of a military commander. His curved blade sheathed into his belt, he planted his pointed shield firmly into the moist cavern ground, removed his helmet, and bowed.<br/>\n<br/>\n The orcs erupted with laughter. \u2018A Half Blood!\u2019 One shouted. \u2018Puny half blood come to die!!\u2019<br/>\n<br/>\n The Orcish champion sneered and beckoned to the crowd. \u2018Look at little half-blood everyone. Humans made him weak.\u2019<br/>\n<br/>\n He turned to face the shorter challenger, his\u00a0scowl curved into a toothy smile.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#000000\">\u00a0\u2018You be squashed like bug.\u00a0</span>You no where near as strong as me.\u2019<br/>\n<br/>\n The half orc, unphased, simply raised his left hand and curled his fingers back and forth several times.<br/>\n<br/>\n The Champion steeled his gaze, enraged at the challenger\u2019s nonchelant taunt. He raised his giant axe with one hand and charged at full speed at the Half Orc, the clansmen screaming and jeering.<br/>\n<br/>\n The half orc kicked his shield over at full force and it skidded across the cavern floor. 15 feet from the giant orc, it slipped itself directly under his left foot, and the Champion instantly lost balance. He surfed one-legged on the shield for a brief moment before catapulting the shield underfoot toward the opposite end of the cavern. Landing flat on his backside but still maintaining momentum on the slushy ground, he slid directly toward the half-orc, his giant axe now flailing wildly.<br/>\n<br/>\n As he slid past, he took a desperate swipe. The challenger deftly dodged it, unsheathed his curved sword, and swiftly beheaded the Champion. The crowd fell silent.<br/>\n<br/>\n The half orc casually strolled to the end of the cavern where his shield had landed and retreived it. He then returned to the now headless corpse, sheathed his sword, and bowed once again.<br/>\n<br/>\n \u2018Perhaps. But I am most certainly smarter.\u2019\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n Fighter Bard RDD is a well traversed level split for obvious reasons: Plenty of everything in the melee department. Looking at the old archive, there are several Fighter28/bard2/RDD 10 builds:<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#FFFFFF\"><strong>Dragon Warrior</strong> </span>fighter 28 / bard 2 / red dragon disciple 10<span style=\"color:#FFFFFF\"> </span>(human?)<span style=\"color:#FFFFFF\"> </span>by Spooky222<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#FFFFFF\"><strong>The Draconic Warrior</strong> </span>fighter 28 / bard 2 / red dragon disciple 10<span style=\"color:#FFFFFF\"> </span>(human)<span style=\"color:#FFFFFF\"> </span>by SlimReaper<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#FFFFFF\"><strong>Munchkin the Dwarf Dragon Wannabe</strong> </span>fighter 28 / bard 2 / red dragon disciple 10<span style=\"color:#FFFFFF\"> </span>(dwarf)<span style=\"color:#FFFFFF\"> </span>by Xylophone<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#FFFFFF\"><strong>Whirling Dever</strong> </span>fighter 28 / bard 2 / red dragon disciple 10<span style=\"color:#FFFFFF\"> </span>(human)<span style=\"color:#FFFFFF\"> </span>by gorche<span style=\"color:#FFFFFF\"> </span><span style=\"color:#FFFFFF\">\u00a0</span><br/>\n<br/>\n None, however, are half orc. Being a half Orc, Brutus has the highest strength possible for a melee character without using Dragon Shape, and also the highest Dev Crit DC possible of 53 with maximised strength. Overwhelming Critical and Epic Weapon Specialisation ensure that each hit that is not a devastating critical most certainly hurts.<br/>\n<br/>\n In addition to this, he\u2019s also quite intelligent. Multiple feats and skills allow for versatility in combat.Overall, a solid combatant, competent in both low and high magic environments. A benchmark point and click tank for the ages!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"color:#000000\">The original discussion of this concept can be viewed </span><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2354626/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#0000CD\">here</span></a><span style=\"color:#0000CD\">.</span></strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Advantages</strong><br/>\n -Very High Strength, and thus very High AB and\u00a0<span style=\"color:#000000\">High Damage with Epic Weapon Specialisation,</span><br/>\n -Devastating Critical DC [DC 53, 12-20 with a keened scimitar and max strength]. If this is disallowed or not to your liking, I recommend replacing it with Armour Skin,<br/>\n -Decent AC,<br/>\n -Decent HP,<br/>\n -Lots of Combat Feats, including Improved Knockdown, Improved Power Attack [+10 Damage for -10AB], Improved Expertise [+10AC for -10AB], and Called Shot.<br/>\n -Plenty of completentary skills: Taunt, Use Magic Device and Spellcraft.\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>Disadvantages:</strong><br/>\n -Average Saving Throws, particularly reflex and will. Sadly, hard to avoid on a Fighter without going CoT, and so save boosting or immunity to fear gear may be required to deal with some opponents. Spellcraft helps but only in the later stages. Fortitude is not bad, but requires gear to reach a level whereby it is competent enough to withstand dev crits.<br/>\n -No detect skill. In the event that this cripples the character, Listen skill should be swapped out for Taunt.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n -Has to deal with a 20% experience penalty from level 23 onwards. Not a dealbreaker, but certainly noticable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Without further ado, presenting Brutus!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;line-height:normal\"><strong>Fighter(28), Bard(2), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Half-Orc</strong></span><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Alignment:</strong> Any non-Lawful.

With regards to Spellcraft, Taunt and UMD: This will depend on the conditions of the module. If more UMD is required for Item use, or Listen for Detection, I recommend sacrificing taunt before spellcraft.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n And that's it!
