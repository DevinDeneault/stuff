      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">OK i figured you guys would like this. Sorry for late reply workin and all that adulting stuff<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKpaZwEeY5Nuti0-fITmTxOWp2H4L71Cz6Jsizj2LCs8ms=s96-c\" /><br/>\n<br/>\nbuild me a neverwinter nights character with 3 classes with the highest average armor class and attack bonus up to level forty<br/>\n<br/>\nChatGPT<br/>\n<br/>\nCreating a character with three classes in Neverwinter Nights that can maximize Armor Class (AC) and Attack Bonus up to level forty is challenging. The game's mechanics and rules make it difficult to reach the highest levels with multiple classes without sacrificing too much. However, here's an example of a character build that could be effective up to level forty:\n<ol>\n<li>Fighter (Base Attack Bonus: High)\n<ul>\n<li>Class Levels: 20</li>\n<li>Feats: Weapon Focus (Melee Weapon of Choice), Weapon Specialization (Melee Weapon of Choice), Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Epic Weapon Focus, Epic Weapon Specialization, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, Cleave, Great Cleave, Improved Critical (Melee Weapon of Choice), Toughness, Iron Will, Epic Prowess, and other relevant feats.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Monk (Base Attack Bonus: High)\n<ul>\n<li>Class Levels: 10</li>\n<li>Feats: Improved Unarmed Strike, Improved Grapple, Stunning Fist, Weapon Finesse, Improved Evasion, Great Dexterity (or Epic Character), and other relevant feats.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Paladin (Base Attack Bonus: Moderate)\n<ul>\n<li>Class Levels: 10</li>\n<li>Feats: Divine Grace, Divine Health, Lay on Hands, Smite Evil, and other relevant Paladin feats.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\nThis character combines the durability and combat skills of a Fighter, the mobility and unarmored AC bonus of a Monk, and the Divine Grace and Smite Evil abilities of a Paladin. To maximize AC and Attack Bonus:\n<ul>\n<li>Prioritize high Strength for better damage output and Dexterity for AC.</li>\n<li>Invest in Charisma to enhance Paladin abilities.</li>\n<li>Use the best available armor for your Fighter levels.</li>\n<li>For Monk levels, focus on Unarmed Strikes or a Monk weapon, as well as using light armor or no armor to maximize the Monk's AC bonus.</li>\n</ul>\nWhile this character can have high AC and Attack Bonus, please note that the more you spread your levels across different classes, the less you will advance in each class, potentially limiting your access to high-level class features and abilities. You'll also have fewer feats and skills compared to single-class characters. Always consider your preferred playstyle when creating a character, and be aware that specializing in one or two classes may often be more effective in Neverwinter Nights.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Be a strength-based dexer in heavy/ no armour with feats that don't exist and some that belong to a different class entirely.
