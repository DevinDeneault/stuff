Im not experienced in DnD or NWN tbh it would be my first playtrough of NWN however I did NWN2 playtrough in the past. I love this game and started it countless time with different noobish builds but only finished 1st act of OC and never tried DLCs&gt;&lt;</div>\n<div align=\"center\">I have idea of 3 slightly different builds of jedi knight - \u00a0jedi counsular, jedi knight and jedi sentinel named after KOTOR classification however builds itself more like films reference - high wisdom and probably charisma, skilled with sword and wear no armor (so monk lvl is most for robes and AC) no shield and no ranged combat.</div>\n<strong>Here is my thoughts:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>For all three:</strong> lawful good aligment, WIS&gt;14, CHA&gt;12, divine casting, monk lvls (monk robes and wisdom AC), persuade and hide skills (atleast around 10-15 each)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Jedi consular\u00a0</strong>(character example - master Ioda): highest wisdom and casting ability, dex based melee(scimitar or short sword focus), supernatural dodge skills(or may be focus on parry), good negotiator.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Jedi sentinel\u00a0</strong>(although there is no reference in films I think Obi Wan Kenobi is good example): ability to infiltrate, negotiate and investigate - sneaky, looking for smart and elegant decisions instead of rushing into fight but still good combatant especialy face to face<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Jedi Knight\u00a0</strong>(Mace Windu is a good example): best melee combatant out of this three, brilliant with a sword (probably require weapon master class) STR based melee.<br/>\n<br/>\n Can u guys help me with these builds? Just for RP PvM. Can u say how difficult it will be to play one of those 1-20 and 1-40?

OC Lvl 18, SoU/HotU Lvl 28).\u00a0 If you are planning to play several different modules, caps will all be different.\u00a0 Apologies, but I have no clue what a \"DLC\" is so you will need to explain.\u00a0 Typically, the OC is played with one toon, then SoU/HotU (with or without a bridge module) with another, and then each of the premiums with their own.\u00a0 Or are you referring to playing CC (Community Content)? No matter.\u00a0 Each of those has different caps and features.<br/>\n<br/>\n Rather than ending up with a mish-mash of ideas that may not be all that effective, how about settling on a single campaign or campaign combo and then face each other build as you encounter them.\u00a0 I seriously doubt that any single \"one-size-fits-all\" build will service your multi-layered request equally.<br/>\n<br/>\n BTW, your English writing seems fine to me.\u00a0 Don't anticipate any problems there.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Those are fun to play, and the OC is great for learning how to play the game, but don't limit yourself to just those. For me, the biggest appeal of NWN is the huge library of user-made modules to download and play. For example, after you finish HotU at level 28, take that character into the Sands of Fate series to go the rest of the way to level 40. The Aielund Saga (levels 1 - 36) is awesome, and it would be great for that katana build that Hip mentioned.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Plan on investing in all the +WIS gear you can find since you will be needing lots of pre-buff slots plus it will boost your AC. Domain choice is a tough call.<em> Trickery</em> seems worthwhile, but would need at least Clc 9 to use ImpInvis so really not worth it unless you vest in traps/locks.\u00a0 Perhaps in SoU/HotU that would be a better choice. I like <em>Magic</em> for Mage Armor/Stoneskin.\u00a0 <em>Strength</em> Stoneskin doesn't occur until Clc 9 so that is out. Maybe <em>Plant</em> for Barkskin but there are loads of Barkskin pots in the OC and the Plant version will only net +1 Nat AC over those. CD is way beyond the scope of a Lvl 18 build. Strength seems automatic to me for a pre-epic BAB less than 16.\u00a0 <em>War domain</em> good for a Dexer but AoV is also beyond this build.<br/>\n<br/>\n Note that nothing but a Dexer can use stealth effectively but since STR is your default choice, so be it. You'll have 25 skill points to spread around as non-combat skills of your choice.\u00a0 Enjoy!<br/>\n<br/>\n So, anyway, review and comment...<br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\n<br/>\n Monk(6), Fighter(4), Cleric(8), Any Lawful Human<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 14 (18)<br/>\n DEX: 8<br/>\n CON: 10<br/>\n WIS: 16<br/>\n INT: 14<br/>\n CHA: 14<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Monk(1): Blind Fight, Lightning Reflexes<br/>\n 02: Fighter(1): Wpn Prof Exotic<br/>\n 03: Cleric(1): Power Attack, Domains Strength/Magic<br/>\n 04: Monk(2): STR+1 (STR=15)<br/>\n 05: Fighter(2): WF: Katana<br/>\n 06: Cleric(2): Extend Spell<br/>\n 07: Monk(3)<br/>\n 08: Fighter(3): STR+1 (STR=16)<br/>\n 09: Cleric(3): Empower Spell<br/>\n 10: Monk(4)<br/>\n 11: Fighter(4): WS: Katana<br/>\n 12: Cleric(4): STR+1 (STR=17), ImpCrit: Katana<br/>\n 13: Cleric(5)<br/>\n 14: Cleric(6)<br/>\n 15: Cleric(7): Div Shield<br/>\n 16: Monk(5): STR+1, (STR=18)<br/>\n 17: Monk(6)<br/>\n 18: Cleric(8): Div Might<br/>\n<br/>\n HP: 152<br/>\n Saves (F/W/R): 15/15/9 (19/19/12 vs spells)<br/>\n Other saves: Mind Effects: +2<br/>\n BAB: 14<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 19 (melee), 13 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 17/24<br/>\n<br/>\n Discipline 20(24), Hide 20(19), Move Silently 20(19), Spellcraft 18(20), Tumble 20(19), remaining --&gt; 25<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Discipline(4), Hide(4), Move Silently(4), Tumble(4), Save(12)<br/>\n 02: Discipline(1), Save(16)<br/>\n 03: Spellcraft(6), Save(15<br/>\n 04: Discipline(2), Hide(3), Move Silently(3), Tumble(3), Save(11)<br/>\n 05: Discipline(1), Save(15)<br/>\n 06: Spellcraft(3), Save(17)<br/>\n 07: Discipline(2), Hide(3), Move Silently(3), Tumble(3), Save(13)<br/>\n 08: Discipline(1), Save(17)<br/>\n 09: Spellcraft(3), Save(19)<br/>\n 10: Discipline(2), Hide(3), Move Silently(3), Tumble(3), Save(15)<br/>\n 11: Discipline(1), Save(19)<br/>\n 12: Spellcraft(3), Save(21)<br/>\n 13: Spellcraft(1), Save(25)<br/>\n 14: Spellcraft(1), Save(29)<br/>\n 15: Spellcraft(1), Save(33)<br/>\n 16: Discipline(5), Hide(6), Move Silently(6), Tumble(6), Save(17)<br/>\n 17: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(1), Save(20)<br/>\n 18: Remaining(25)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If you want to know more about Aielund (including what to download from the Vault), you could go to the NWN World section of the Guild, Modules forum, The Aielund Saga thread, where there's an ongoing discussion of the campaign.

So I think it would be 16 WIS 12 CHA and 10 DEX or invest more in STR?<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n It's not as bad as all that really.\u00a0 What the elevated CHA did for my attempt was open up DivMight/DivShield for a monk which is quite uncommon but effective nonethless.\u00a0 I would expect that, combined with WIS AC and cleric AC buffs, this AC could reach very high levels.<br/>\n \u00a0<br/>\n Now, as to Divine Power... the way it automatically raises STR to 18 is worthless in a STR build but the additional full BAB attack works well.\u00a0 Usually, DP is part of a DEX build but still can be effective in this case.<br/>\n<br/>\n What you will be aiming for is Monk 20/Cleric 15/Fighter5 in the epic version so figure on 2 more points to WIS for Level 8 slots.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Clerics can make up very well for any lack of gimped (less than 30) primary ability to boost AB on it's own.\u00a0 It's the main feature of that class.\u00a0 In most cases, you should be able to reach the +20 AB cap by combining weapon enhancement, buffs and reaching ability cap (in this case, +12 STR).\u00a0 Your in-game AB should be in the same ballpark as a WM, in the 50's somewhere.\u00a0 A key bonus with divine AB is that it can penetrate all DR, damage resistance and damage immunity.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'd leave the ability spread \"as is\" for the moment.\u00a0\n<blockquote><div>So I can't reach level 40 with all diamond edition content and have to use some player created modules?</div></blockquote>\n Ahhh...\u00a0 I see what you were considering now.\u00a0 You thought you could just string all the Bioware modules together, one after another, to reach level 40.\u00a0 A common mistake by new players.\u00a0 No worries.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n The fact is: Each BW module (except for HotU) has been designed for a starting toon.\u00a0 That means that killing hostiles to gain experience relies on something called CR (Challenge Rating) of each foe.\u00a0 The higher the CR, the more XP you will get.\u00a0 But all the modules have set creatures at a very low CR for starting toons and increase CR slowly.\u00a0 Therefore, as you continue to start a new BW module with a high-level PC, you will get the minimum XP (which, as I recall, is 4 XP per kill solo) so will gain so little to complete the module it becomes just tedious.\u00a0 There will be NO challenge at all and no fun for Jedi or Sith.\u00a0 Quest rewards are the same, but still are a minor portion of the overall XP tally per module.<br/>\n<br/>\n To reach level 40 (and even beyond into legendary levels up to 60), you need to either play custom content that has designed high-CR encounters into it or play on a PW (or LAN).\u00a0 Players like me usually play SP content without caring how high level can be reached and, if the build seems to be working well, start the same build over on a challenging PW.\u00a0 SP serves more like a practice area for me where one can save the game and then pick up where you left off.\u00a0 Some SP can be very challenging, so look for those that have limited rest opportunities and serious death penalties.\u00a0 Conditions like that will mimic those found on most competitive PWs and will make you a better all-around player.\n<blockquote><div>How this build will look at epic levels or it would be better to go different one? Probably replace fighter with CoT to get rid of xp penalty?</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">I stated previously the final class split I had in mind.\u00a0 To qualify for CoT, you would need to take a \"throw-away\" feat like WF: kama just to open up CoT and then take WF: katana. The XP penalty can be minimized to a handful of levels for most of the build so, IMO, not all that much of a deterrent.<br/>\n<br/>\n Besides that, CoT requires BAB+7 which will take much of pre-epic to reach with 3/4 BAB classes (Clc/Mnk).\u00a0 The sacred defense saves would help, naturally, but with only 5 levels open, hardly worth the effort.\u00a0 In a CoT-heavy build, a sacrificial feat would be easier to reconcile. When building toons, feats are GOLD!<br/>\n<br/>\n In this build, though, I am focusing on building BAB as quickly as possible for playability at early levels.\u00a0 Also, getting EWF/EWS on a single epic fighter level allows you to reach monk's 50% concealment and immunity to mind spells (not to mention a katana-wielder with glowing blue eyes) with the classic Cleric 15 buff optimization.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

There is little a pally can do that cleric can't do better except for smiting. Pallies are better implemented as CHA-based synergies for DM/DS builds. Yes, saves will be slightly better, but at what cost?\u00a0<em> Negative Energy Protection</em> is a must-have vs. shadows and other drain attacks.\u00a0 <em>Hammer of the Gods</em> and <em>Word of Faith</em> are two of the most effective mob-control spells in the game.\u00a0 <em>Battletide</em> has a double combat bonus that not only increases your AB by 2 but also your effective AC by the same amount besides the boost to saves.\u00a0 And you are going to love Empowered <em>Healing Circle</em> when surrounded by undead.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Holy Sword</em> was nerfed badly by v1.69 so a caster level 10 dispel for half the hits is hardly worth investing heavily to achieve.\u00a0 Besides, the enhancement is still bugged so when the spell wears off your +10 weapon will be hitting as a +5 one until you un-equip/re-equip.\u00a0 On the positive side, pally can empower Bull and Eagle just as a cleric can but like I said, CHA-based builds are better for pally for long durations of damage and AC boosts.\u00a0 A cleric can access <em>AoV</em> with War Domain, if you feel it may be difficult to reach ability caps.<br/>\n<br/>\n It's not so much of a gimp (though it is to some degree) as it is a lack of versatility to face many situations with the same degree of competence.\u00a0 But then, if you are not comfortable with extensive self-buffing (many players fall into this category), I can understand the hesitancy.\u00a0 Cleric simply has more potential but both are feat-starved classes so that aspect is a wash. The other factor is that focusing more into WIS actually gains high-level spells for a cleric whereas a pally has little need for WIS over 14, especially with a STR-focus.\u00a0 A cleric self-buffing Empowered Owl will gain +3 AC by virtue of the monk synergy where a pally is limited to Clvl 3 pots.\n<blockquote><div>and for the level 40 build where I can reach lvl 20 monk I think there is no need for divine spell casting restriction since lvl 20 monk looks superhuman enough for the \"Jedi\", is it better or worse to make monk/fighter/wm(katana) than mentioned monk/cleric/fighter or it would be just different?</div></blockquote>\n Keep in mind that all your classes will be developing slowly to avoid XP penalty.\u00a0 Monk 20 won't happen until level 40 with all the alternating.\n<blockquote><div>The more I think about paladin/monk the more I like it RP wise for jedi knight (although cleric/fighter/monk suit for jedi consular)</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">You might like the idea for its RP value but it will be weaker than the cleric/monk by far. Gut \"feelings\" and kewlness can become expensive when it comes to optimizing a build.\u00a0 However, if you would like to see an example for your own edification I can piece one together.\u00a0</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You wouldn't be able to take fist as your Weapon of Choice, so WM would have to fall by the wayside if you went with that option, but you could do it with kamas. Either way, taking katana would severely gimp you, with little or no reward.<br/>\n<br/>\n However, if you're dead set on a katana build but flexible on classes, Empyre has come up with a couple of great ones in the aforementioned Aielund thread, which you might want to have a look at.

Here's a M / F / WM I made earlier this week to play some time later in SoU, the Nether Scrolls, HotU, and Sands of Fate. He has the highest AB of any Monk I ever made, but the lowest AC by far. For RP purposes, picture him dual-wielding lightsabers with an unusual grip, like Count Dooku, but on the light side. He has not been tested, so I don't know how badly the low AC will affect him.

You wouldn't be able to take fist as your Weapon of Choice, so WM would have to fall by the wayside if you went with that option, but you could do it with kamas. Either way, taking katana would severely gimp you, with little or no reward.</div>\n</div></blockquote>\n Let's try to quantify the exact compromises of certain preferences when integrating the monk class.\u00a0 The class can be used for more than just skill dumps (classic Mnk 6), DW kama build or UBAB.<br/>\n<br/>\n Using non-monk weapons will use the standard -5 BAB progression.\u00a0 Yes, it's a concilation, but isn't it amazing how many builds do so well with the standard progression?\u00a0<img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\n You'll be able to reach 5 APR with a combo of Divine Power and Haste while the monk's kama APR (hasted w/DP) would be 7, with the free attacks (DP/haste) using the standard -5 progression.\u00a0 The katana version will always be using full AB since both DWing and FoB reduce it by at least -2 and another -2, respectively (i.e. DW w/FoB -4 AB).\u00a0 Once you begin to factor all the quick spam attacks into the mix, suddenly that lofty -3 progression begins to approach and then fade behind the katana.\u00a0 High APR is better for DevCrit than damage per round vs high AC because your chances of a natural 20 increase dramatically on any of the attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\n When using DP, BAB &lt; 16 is ALWAYS the optimization.\u00a0 Here's a revisit to those who may have forgotten or never realized it:<br/>\n<br/>\n (We'll assuming a STR-focused build in both cases to make this easier to quantify.)<br/>\n<br/>\n Sample #1: BAB &gt;/= 16 (4 APR)<br/>\n Before DP: +30/+25/+20/+15<br/>\n During DP: +30/+25/+20/+15<br/>\n<br/>\n Sample #2: BAB 11 thru 15 (3 APR)<br/>\n Before DP: +30/+25/+20<br/>\n During DP: +30/+25/+20/+30<br/>\n<br/>\n Sample #3: BAB 6 thru 10 (2 APR)<br/>\n Before DP: +30/+25<br/>\n During DP: +30/+25/+30/+25<br/>\n<br/>\n ...which is why a DP build should always stay below BAB 16 to reap the best AB.\u00a0\u00a0 So, a sorc or wiz with enough cleric levels to access DP can actually hit better than a fighter.<br/>\n<br/>\n So... then what EXACTLY will be gained by a toon wielding just a katana in robes that reaches Monk 20?<br/>\n<br/>\n Combat Feats: Cleave, KD/IKD<br/>\n Intrinsic Characteristics: deflection of missiles w/Refl 20 min, immune to half-damage reflex spells (most evoc school), immunity to poison/disease/mind spells, non-breachable SR 30, +4 monk AC, 160% move speed<br/>\n Activations: limited self-healing, limited 50% concealment<br/>\n<br/>\n Still sounds like a pretty good deal to me even without kamas or bare fists.<br/>\n<br/>\n As far as trying to force-feed WM into all these personal biases and RP constraints just to expand the crit range and increase damage on crit, IMO it is act of futility.\u00a0 There are too many prereqs for WM that could have been used for useful combat enhancements.\u00a0 If you want to knock yourself out to prove it to yourself, then start designing. It will be an education at least. Figure on a minimum of WM 19 to make it at all worthwhile.\u00a0\u00a0 I've never been a fan of the WM 5 or WM 7 builds because they cater too much to killing easy foes quickly while never gaining any better competency vs. bosses.\u00a0 I'd pass on this idea if you want to focus on the most productive sort of builds rather than those that just seem kewl.<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
