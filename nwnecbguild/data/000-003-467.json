      "content": "<div>I'm looking for some general advice for a new character for the pw I play on. I'm not looking for someone to fully build it, just some class mix and feat/theme guidelines (or point to other builds already made as examples).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been playing nwn for years but only started online 3 months ago. Ive been on the pw I'm about to describe below for 2 months and have 2 characters up to level 40 - Mith's blood and faith and Dwarven Landslide (f10 dd14 wm 16).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe pw is mid-to high magic with ILR - you can buy up to +7 weapons (lvl21 ILR ) and armor and depending on alignment special shops have +10. +10 is the max allowed and there are forges that can add tons of properties, although it gets exponentially more expensive and pushes ILR up. \u00a0Once you get halfway through the main quest you have the option to but more powerful gear in terms of non-enhancement bonus properties (eg 5 + 2d10 damage bonuses etc)\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting items with immunity to knockdown and death magic is not too hard and you can add haste to items past a certain point. \u00a0No true sight items and most enemies do not have it- eg some bosses and creatures you would typically expect ( mind flayers, boss dragons, clerics who cast the spell true sight etc).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSpells are not modified at all eg Harm, but main plot bosses are harm immune and clerics cast neg energy pro at first encounter.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nMost potions incl heal are easily available and almost all scrolls are available as well incl 9th level spells\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nClasses and feats are not modified either and there is NOT an abundance of crit immune creatures outside the normal undead, constructs, etc at least so far (I am only 33% through the main quest).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main quest and some other quest does have locks and traps that need to be dealt with although the main quest locks dont have a dc higher than 30, so a pc w 10-15 OL is enough. \u00a0Traps on doors need to be dealt with you can't just run through them. Find trap scrolls are available.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of other players there are many times were there are no other lvl 40 players on or they are elsewhere. I'm looking for pvm suggestions on builds that will play mostly solo but also in parties when available. I'm comfortable and have played clerics and fighters online and the dwarflord's Deathstroke build through the OC and HotU. \u00a0My Dwarven landslide pc now can't get to certain areas due to no OL or traps or UMD. He has good damage which I like (200-250 pt crits). My cleric (blood and faith build) is very versatile but seems to lack a punch against hard enemies and it becomes more a war of attrition - eg my 400 heal potions and smaller attacks vs your 4 heal potions but powerful attacks. \u00a0I'm less comfortable playing wizards just because so much time was spent playing the OC and other lower level modules, but I'm open to anything.\u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>This sounds like a place where a meleer will thrive. I would avoid playing any mage, as those settings are generally very imbalanced for those types of characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are a couple of ideas you may wanna try out:<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladin 26 WM 13 Monk or Rogue 1 (if there isn't any dispelling going on, you can try Paladin 20 Monk or Rogue 1 Weapon Master 19 for +2 AB)<br/>\nFighter 12 WM 25 Rogue 3<br/>\nFighter 28 Bard 2 RDD 10<br/>\nPaladin 26 Fighter 12 Rogue 2<br/>\n<br/>\nClerics in general would be a bad idea, except for Mith's Blood &amp; Faith or his Hierophant (which would probably be locked in a few battles of 20), because of the Wisdom investment required to cast the spells and the pathetic damage compared to the weapon damage properties that they would do. Druids are terrible because of how much you lose from the items that don't merge on shift, so I would recommend only going shifter to take Rakshasa shape and have over 100 AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want a more skillfull build you can go with Kail's Bard 16 Rogue 14 RDD 10, or my Bane Crusher build (Ranger 23 Rogue 16 SD 1). There is also Bard / PM / RDD if you like to be locked in a battle of 20's all the time, as that is a high AC low AB build.<br/>\n<br/>\nA Great Smiter Paladin 29 CoT 10 Monk or Rogue 1 would also be good, I presume.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you need an Open Lock version earlier, then maybe you can make a Fighter 10 Rogue 5 WM 25 losing 2 AB points for more skill points and playability.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal recommendation on those settings would be Fighter 12 Wm 25 Rogue 3.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!</div>"

      "content": "<div>I agree with Max about the WM.  If there are few crit-immunes on a high-magic server (which is an extremely rare situation BTW), WMs should rule PvM.  Not sure which build I would recommend but there is usually a decision to make between max APR via kama monk/WM (plus some handy closing speed), max crit range via fighter/kukrimaster WM or CoT/kukrimaster WM (better vs. uber mages).  I am assuming that DevCrit works as it does on vanilla in this recommendation.  And, as is usually the case when item enchantments abound, builds will often revolve around procuring those items which have been imbued with the most exploitive properties and THAT I cannot offer any suggestions about.  For example, in the build choice described above, if \"killer\" kamas are available, a bias has been set by the server that you may want to exploit or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n--&gt; BTW, is that Find Traps spell being used vanilla or nerfed to just locate them and not disable?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if highly-elemental enchanted arrow stacks are available, universally, some sort of AA will dominate.   For the highest magic server I ever played, with the monster blueprints containing insane HPs, SR &amp; saves  (thus reducing casting mages, bards and clerics to some sort of support role just to survive) and ridiculous AC levels, only the solo AA never died out of over a dozen other builds I played through the entire server.  (I should add that they had a few bosses that had been empowered with some exotic recipro damage that would return twice the amount of physical damage they took to the attacker which allowed no save or resistance.  A real nasty situation but it was set up that hard to acquire a semi-godly item.) I tried many mixes, but found that by using divine AA combo (clc/brd/AA), the divine damage was reliably irresistable against all foes... and with animal domain... the AA could place decent tankers up that wouldn't die in 2 secs.  If not divine, then a ranger/AA works for pretty much the same reason, good meat shields.  But the divine one is superior IMO.  Even without uber arrows, the AA's AB will pierce extremely high AC monsters when other builds will be relying on 20's to do damage. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your server is not as imposing as a high-magic environment like this, an AA will rule even more.  But naturally, one would need to be comfortable with archer strategy and game play which many players are not.  They like kewler-looking toons or are elf bigots.  <br/>\n<br/>\nedit: Oh drat!

      "content": "<div>A couple comments:<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, Find Traps is vanilla and disabled.  Dev Crit is vanilla.  No feats or spells have been modified.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of weapons, they're all more or less the same at high level - no abundance of super-weapons of one type or another.  <br/>\n<br/>\n@ HipM - if you mean plant domain for Barkskin, you can easily buy amulets of natural armor + 1 through +7 and can add up to +5 Natural AC onto any amulet via a forge, so Barkskin certainly isn't a good reason to go Plant domain.  Same with Boots - can add up to +5 dodge to any boots, so UMD for monk gear isn't that hot (although UMD for scrolls and some alignment shifted gear is).<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn't say crit immune creatures are rare, just not overly rare.  for example in OC and HoTU, it seemed like there was an over abundance of undead, golemns, and all bosses were crit immune.  On this server it just seems to be an average mix<br/>\n<br/>\nMy default next character without any feedback here was going to be F10 R3 WM25, though trying to decide on a base 18-20x2 weapon vs BattleAxe x3 was a decision (note: there's too many good shields with stat boots, damage reduction/resistance, and other good properties to go 2handed).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are highly enchanted stacks of [not-cheap] arrows (some have like 6 damage bonuses, some have Mord Disj on hit, etc) available but only once you're a certain point through the main quest, which definitely needs a well-equipped lvl40 to do.  But you can also buy a [also not cheap] magic quiver that can produce unlimited arrows of one type.</div>"

Eventually, once you get access to SC9, the \"boost\" ends, but it is a huge help while trying to level fast.  (BTW, the domain boost has the same effect on scrolls &amp; other items that summon creatures.)  Also, having Cat's available makes a DEX AA's AB that much more potent especially if Empowered.  And you can pretty much ignore the potential XP drain from the summons, they will seldom actually kill anything but are effective diversions (be careful about using imbued arrows around them, though... IIRC it counts as offensive AoE damage vs. them  )<br/>\n<br/>\nMax, avado &amp; I were hashing out the pros and cons of a WIS-focused build like this in <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/bowyer-bandito-divino-cleric-23-bard-2-arcane-archer-15-t515441.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>a build thread I posted</strong></a>, but in a high-magic environment, spells tend to have little affect on monsters with their modified skins so in that scenario I would go the DEX AA route.  The special AA arrow DCs are DEX-based, so it helps to focus that way.  Also, with a DEX build variant, one could also add Weapon Finesse with a rapier to their repertoire and retain the high AB and divine damage when they made a weapon switch. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn either case (WIS or DEX), the spread is the same... Cleric 23/Bard 2/AA 15 or 24/1/15 depending on your play style and item availability (Tumble AC isn't all that important to a pure artillery archer... or ANY AC for that matter... and class-specific/alignment-specific items may or may not be all that beneficial to the toon).  That extra cleric level (to 24) gleans better resistance vs. dispelling so it may be worthwhile.  The only issue with this combo is the XP penalty, but on high-magic USUALLY it is relatively easy to reach level 40 soloing anyway.  So... either wiz or sorc could be subbed if it becomes a serious consideration, in which case I would go with the 24/1/15 split.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIf spells ARE effective against the monsters on the server, though, you could use spells like HoG &amp; SoV for mob control and ignore the summons altogether.  And in that situation, the WIS build would be better even though the racial bias favors a DEX one.  Also, I would ignore the DS/DM feats entirely unless you can easily cap CHA to make it feasible.<br/>\n<br/>\nSounds like you have access to arrows that would complement a divine AA's strengths nicely.  Worth a shot IMO.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Spells are hit and miss - I stopped using offensive spells other than Harm (coupled with Invis).  The server is set to Full PVP, so SoV hurts party members (although I don't party up too much), but for some reason is also targets you (the caster).  Not sure why, but I really ripped myself up the first two times I cast it.  I honestly like seeing enemy priests cast it bc it doesn't affect me much and it hurts them more than me.  HoG and WoF don't seem to do too much, implosion occasionally works (worked better when i first got lvl9 spells, but now vs lvl 40 opponents, not so much).  Firestorm is alright, but it's usually just faster to hit them (e.g. everyone seems to make saves).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of capping abilities, there are lesser ioun stones available for each stat (adds +2 for 24 hours, only 1 stone active).  You can also buy Ring of Intellect up to +10, amulet wisdom up to +10, Bracers Dex up to +10, nymph cloak up to +7, and str items up to +4, although many armors and items are available and will be found by 40 (e.g. fire giant belt [+5]), greater dragon slippers +3str +3dex, etc).  Con bonuses are all over the place too, although only a few 30+ boss/quest items give +10.  So in terms of buffs, capping of any desired score is available by the time you're 40 with a wide variety.  <br/>\n<br/>\nMany locked doors have been set to \"plot\" so Knock isn't an option, some level (10-15 points) of Open Lock is needed for solo'ers.  Same with Traps, many traps set to continuous, so they need to be disabled or Find Traps scroll (vanilla, they WILL disable).<br/>\n<br/>\nMax earlier said this \n<blockquote><div>then maybe you can make a Fighter 10 Rogue 5 WM 25 losing 2 AB points for more skill points and playability.</div></blockquote>\n\nassuming he was comparing to F12 R3 WM25, wouldn't that be just -1AB, losing 1 AB at R4 instead of Fighter (assuming 1-2 pre-epic rogue level)?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf dev crit isn't available or not worth taking, do you end up taking epic feats like Energy Resistance or Epic Toughness just to fill slots?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm thinking given the potions and scrolls available  a Fighter/Rogue/WM is the way I might go something in the 12/3/25 or 10/5/25 mix.  Esp since almost all the Paladin's spells are rendered redundant via high level items outside of Bless, Aid, Prayer.</div>"

I can't be sure since I don't remember their fort saves. I do know that the prismatic dragons are dev critable. Also the northland pirates are dev critable as well. After that, dev crit is pretty much useless. The Lost Rhun areas are mostly undead, and once you reach the Abyss or Hell, there are a lot of constructs, and anything critable has saves in the 70s or above.</div></blockquote></div>"

In terms of damage, at that level, I'll have regen at least +15 and prob more like 20-25 and have Heal potions galore (my two current 40 lvl PCs have like 300 each), so I'm not too worried about showing up at the boss at less than full HP.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>\nThis looks like the perfect environment for a dexterity based melee character with high AC, ED, SCV, HIPS/stealth and UMD.</div></blockquote>\n\nI've thought about that, although the 11 point damage difference from a 22 STR character vs 44 strength character can be a difference maker as once you get higher level DR becomes more prevalent.  I'm much less familiar with that type of character though.  I played Grizzled Dwarflord's Deathstroke through the OC and part of HoU, but since pretty much any competent character will do well, I didn't really need to do much \"strategery\".</div>"
