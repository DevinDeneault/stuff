That also allows you to have UMD, more SA dice and Tumble as a class skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe that's why you haven't seen many builds with this class combo <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I would say that you'd be better off letting go of Weapon Master. Then you can trash DEX to 8, start with 14 WIS and 14 CHA, which is a bit better. You can reduce BG levels to 4 (to get both DM and DS) and invest in more Ranger levels. Something like Ranger 26 BG 4 Rogue 10, for example (two more FEs than yours).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some ideas for you to think about.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've seen some of your posts and you say that you haven't played online. I have been in that position, and I have to tell you: the OCs are VERY VERY EASY, and not a good test to ANY BUILD. I used to make some very wimpy builds myself when I began building, and they all cruised through the OC. I remember when I used to summon an air elemental, buff him up and just walk beside it while it took care of all the enemies for the most part. It's a learning process. If you're going to play Single Player, I suggest downloading The Aielund Saga, which is MUCH MORE CHALLENGING than anything Bioware has ever made, and also has a better storyline. The links to download the module are here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/the-aielund-saga-t515487.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/the-a ... 15487.html</a> <br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy this GREAT module. IMO it's THE BEST SP MODULE OUT THERE!<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Empyre, I have just finished the first module of the Sands of Fate series.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a good storyline module, definitely worth the time invested in it. However, I'd be inclined to say it's not a particularly good place to test builds. There are many creatures with unique properties, which aren't found anywhere, respawnable traps, etc.. Not to mention the incredibly overpowered items such as the RING OF ELEMENTAL IMMUNITY or the SHADOW PLATE or the HELM OF THE BANESPIRIT. Just saying that this module suffers IMO from the same problem all other high magic worlds suffer: building becomes secondary, and it all becomes a treasure hunt. The only part I found mildly difficult about it was early on, when I had NO GEAR and was still getting to understand the Heat Wave thingy. After you get your equipment, everything becomes just a right click (and a few Heal Potions when they return damage or cast spells) away. Monsters have very low AC, even a few bosses. I think the only monster I had problems hitting was the Guildmaster, and because items are overpowered, most monsters have TONS of HP, which is terrible for casters. You can basically see that whoever made this module didn't concern him or herself with balance at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot flaming the module or anything. It's fun and has a catchy storyline that makes you want to know what's next, but for build testing, Aielund is definitely more balanced.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
