There is probably more but these are the main points I can think of right now:<br/>\n- Spotted creatures cannot sneak attack or death attack from stealth whereas listened creatures can sneak attack / death attack from stealth<br/>\n- Spot does not get worse over distance, whereas listen gets worse by 1 DC every 3 meters from the target<br/>\n- Spotted creatures remain detected until they go out of eyesight, whereas listened creatures can become 'unlistened' and return back to stealth<br/>\n<br/>\nOr in plain language:<br/>\n- A spotter gets less sneak attack damage from stealthy sneakers.<br/>\n- A spotter detects enemies from further away if in eyesight.<br/>\n- Once a spotter detects an enemy is detected they remain detected whilst in eyesight whilst a listener may lose detection of the enemy.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Listen gets detection around walls / corners whereas spot does not<br/>\n- Invisible creatures can be listened but cannot be spotted<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I don't think either approach is necessarily completely wrong but there are particular advantages to spot over listen that I like better which I have listed above but if possible I like perhaps a spot 40 listen 20 split<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be good to get a PvP perspective on this too.\u00a0<br/>\nPvM mechanics are different and very much in favor of the player.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Sometimes it's about simple practicalities such as which classes you're using. Monk has listen but not spot, CoT and Barbarian have spot but not listen, for example, and it's better to have one \"full\" skill than a half-charged cross-classed one (though that's still better than none at all). Equally, ranged builds and stealthy ones will find spot more efficacious (you can't shoot around corners, after all), whereas low dex melee-types might well gain more from listen. As with much in the game, it depends largely on the build and your chosen play-style. It also depends on whether the environment you're playing in has items that help with, for example, true seeing. I know that where I play more \"stuff\" is readily available to aid in spotting enemies than hearing them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, mostly it comes down to personal preference and environment.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">PvM has been covered pretty well so I'll chime in with my experiences in PvP. I'll assume that Listen and Spot are both available, obviously some builds only have access to one as a class skill and some class spreads don't have either detect skill as class skills.<br/>\nThe key spells for this discussion are Amplify, Camouflage/Mass Camouflage, Silence, and True Seeing. In vanilla NWN Amplify gives +20 Listen, Camouflage and Mass Camouflage stack to give +20 Hide, Silence bypasses Listen checks, and vanilla True Seeing can detect everything in your LoS.<br/>\n<br/>\nNormally if vanilla TS is available on PvP servers it is only available for casters, there are almost never vanilla TS items or scrolls available since it would be a huge nerf for sneakers. If vanilla TS is available then I rarely bother with detect on my casters, although as others have already pointed out Listen is mechanically the superior choice. The rest of this post assumes that vanilla TS is not available, either due to class restrictions or nerfs to TS.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I am making a dedicated spotter build (ie aiming for close to 127 Listen/Spot) then I always choose Spot. The fact that you can lose track of a\u00a0heard creature is a huge problem, since in a fight between a dedicated sneaker with HiPS and a\u00a0dedicated spotter the sneaker has an advantage if played properly. Silence is another factor, See Invisibility is usually available in some form on balanced PvP servers but there is no equivalent effect that can penetrate Silence in vanilla NWN.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor high detect builds I usually favour Spot unless there is a particular reason to choose Listen (eg playing a bard that can cast Amplify). Camouflage/Mass Camouflage is still a problem with high Hide sneakers, but with a high Spot it should be able to spot bad/mediocre sneakers that use Camouflage/Mass Camouflage.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor low/mediocre detect builds I tend to favour Listen over Spot as long as there are similar Listen/Spot bonuses in that environment. Those bonuses include both items and spells such as Amplify (+20 Listen) or nerfed TS (ranging from +20 to +50 Spot in my experience). In vanilla NWN Camouflage and Mass Camouflage stack to give +20 Hide, there is no equivalent boost to MS. Assuming that there are similar Listen/Spot bonuses, this gives Listen an advantage over Spot when fighting druids and (particularly) rangers, which are usually some of the most dangerous sneakers.<br/>\nSilence is still a factor here, although if Silence is rare on sneakers then I tend to stick with Listen and accept that it won't be useful against certain bards or clerics. If Silence is common on the server I will usually build for both Listen and Spot, favouring Spot if I can only choose one. It's better to be at a disadvantage when detecting than to not have any chance at all.<br/>\nIf there are large bonuses to only one of the detect skills (usually nerfed TS giving a large Spot bonus) then I tend to choose that detect skill over the other for low/mediocre detect builds. This usually means focusing on Spot, so Silence isn't a problem but Camouflage/Mass Camouflage can still cause issues.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
