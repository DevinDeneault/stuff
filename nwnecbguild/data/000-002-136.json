And if you muddied it, what dirts did you muck with?<br/>\n<br/>\nWith or without umd, battle clerics reach a point of diminishing returns in some respects because they lack a knock out punch for those end game bosses. Sure, they do great melee damage all the time, and they can slap harms about, but on rare occasions that\u2019s not enough. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou said he\u2019s resistant to Silence. Did you cast it on him or yourself?  If on you then he likely has Auto Silence. If on him, well, don\u2019t do that. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgainst damage shields itself:  stay ranged and keep buffs maxed on your ranged weapon and projectiles. Divine favor (extended/hasted/rapidshot/divine power). If you have divine might even better. Keep a steady supply of level 7-9 summons for him to chew on while you unleash holy hell from down range. <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, get a crew. One shouldn\u2019t hunt elder wyrms alone. </div>"
