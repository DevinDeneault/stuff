      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hello ECB, all of the damage shield builds flying around (all two of them) have inspired me to post one of my own. This is a re-imagining of an ancient build I created in ~2005 by the name of \"True Liches Lyrics\", you can find it in the old archives. Back then I was only a child, and the concepts of \"reading\", \"learning\", and \"refining\" had not yet entered my awareness. In fact, they still haven't, I merely wanted to post this build to spur some discussion, and perhaps you folk can help spruce it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe build revolves around a few things: Risen Lord form, Wounding Whispers, Curse Song, and Taunt. It could be massively improved by adding some sane classes (I.E. Palemaster), but nostalgia won't let me do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.redd.it/29gqnw5rx5831.jpg\" /><br/>\n<br/>\nBard(25), Druid(5), Shifter(10),

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I recommend dropping Great CHA 2 for Epic Reputation and ESF: Perform in order to further boost your bard song and Taunt. The +9 Perform and +3 Taunt will probably be more useful than the other bonuses from CHA.\u00a0Since you don't invest in Spot you should swap Artist for\u00a0SF: Perform in order to gain +1 Perform.<br/>\n<br/>\nLower UMD slightly so that you can put 43 points into Concentration and increase your Spellcraft to 43. Even if you won't be casting much mid-combat every caster needs Concentration. After adding the INT modifier 43 Spellcraft becomes 45 Spellcraft which gives an extra +1 to your saves vs spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nRisen Lords get 21 STR, 19 CON, and unchanged DEX.\u00a0They also get 50% Piercing DI and 50% Slashing DI which is the main advantage that this build has over a Bard/PM. [<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Undead_shape\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Undead_shape</a>]<br/>\n<br/>\nThe build is designed for party play, it covers both DR tanking and bard support. Wiz25/Dru5/Shif10 is a similar DR tank that relies on damage shields to kill opponents, although that doesn't have Bard Song or Taunt so it's not as useful in a party when shifted. Combining Bard Song, Curse Song, Taunt, damage shields, high DI, and 9/- physical DR makes for a nice alternative to a standard bard. The main downside with this build is that it's a shifter, so it has a lot of limitations that non-shifter bards don't have. The only ability choices for this build are increasing DEX for higher AC or increasing CHA for higher Perform and Taunt. Since this build focuses on using damage shields and bard song as a support DR tank the higher CHA makes more sense.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe DI combined with undead immunities is the reason for choosing Risen Lord over other shapes. Stone Golem is the only real alternative and building for that requires significant changes. Once the 3 Risen Lord shifts are used up then staying in gnome form will normally be a better option than shifting into another shape, although there are some exceptions such as using Wyrmling form for elemental DI.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Even if you change the pre-epic spread to Bard16/Dru4 and get weapon feats, with +12 STR the AB is limited to +49 self-buffed, excluding Curse Song and Taunt. This requires swapping at least 4 feats (2 pre-epic and 2 epic) and delaying Undead Shape to level 33, all of which will make for a weaker support build and a harder character to level.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrent AB: 23 (BAB) + 11 (STR) + 5 (EB Bonus) + 2 (Warcry) + 2 (Bard Song) = +43<br/>\nMax AB: 25 (BAB) + 11 (STR) + 4 (Feats) + 5 (EB Bonus) + 2 (Warcry) + 2 (Bard Song) = +49<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

After including combat feats the only spare feats are Toughness or ESF: Taunt, so you will have to drop one of them if you want Knockdown.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tested a DEX focused solo version which is why I noticed that you don't have Tumble. Honestly I think you should stick with higher CHA if you change the build for solo play. Even if you build for AC it's still pretty mediocre (at least in a +5 AC environment), plus it makes your damage shields less useful and lowers both your Perform and Taunt.<br/>\n<br/>\nShifted AC (Assuming +12 DEX and one +5 AC item)<br/>\nCurrent AC: 10 (Base) + 5 (DEX) + 3 (Tumble) + 5 (AC Bonus) + 13 (Shape Dodge Bonus) +3 (Mage Armor) +5 (Bard Song) +1 (Haste) = 45<br/>\nDEX version AC: 10 (Base) + 11 (DEX) + 8 (Tumble) + 2 (Feats) + 5 (AC Bonus) + 13 (Shape Dodge Bonus) + 3 (Mage Armor) + 5 (Bard Song) + 1 (Haste) = 58<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
