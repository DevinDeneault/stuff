      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Here in the ECB, Nemusator, we normally don't factor in gear when mentioning the stats of our builds. So, what Mick is trying to say is that items differ from world to world, so your build poster here in the ECB may be used in many different worlds. That means that the items it uses are in a way irrelevant to the build's stats. When you try to figure out max AB, if there is any item being included in your calculations, you should mention it and also mention the value of the stat without said item (s). Just like Mick did, providing his calculations to the build's stats. I like how high the AB is, don't like how low the AC is .<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW I created a toon on Antiworld, but I have to say that I didn't like the custom modifications that you have made there. They clearly favor melee-oriented toons while clearly disfavoring casters (like halving Damage Shields). If you have a caster in fron of you with Mestil's Acid Sheath, then you have to dispel him or have enough HP to withstand the damage. This looks a lot like a Brazilian PW I used to play in. IMO some alterations there should be reviewed so as to diminish the gap between classes, not augment it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I'm not sure what are you missing, but I made this character solely to post it here, and deleted it afterwards so I can't double-check. Ab values are definite. If you would make the char on Antiworld by this recipe it would have same stats. Also there are no items which can grant you mind immunity or alike. And since this is a team pvp, I usually just have tendency to wreak havoc for as long as I can. On the other hand, if I was dealing with something which abuses my low will save, I would wear two +5 to will items, but I highly doubt they would help me much vs anything with high DC. Now, is it just the Antiworld, but I'm pretty sure that con modifier has something to do with the DC of PDK's fear. Only, we nerfed it's endless duration. <br/>\nI also think that the more details the post shows, the more insight into the build itself you have. So I think it is cool to post what your gear gives you, but of course, you will make calculations with your own equipment which is available to you on your server. Also, any good mage player can own on Antiworld... Try, it and you will see. In fact, people are constantly complaining that mages are OP. Which is true in case of good mage player vs not so good other class player. Also, you don't have to be an active player to post your ideas, suggestions... So just go ahead if you have something in mind which could maybe improve things.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Firstly, MUCH better when it comes to the posting. As to the equipment, nothing wrong with listing things you recommend as a side-note at the end of the build (some do, some don't), but don't include the gear figures in your stats. Naked, unbuffed stats is what you need to set out here. Then, under the naked, unbuffed stats, feel free to add in your Buffs (i.e., any spells, feats or skills you actually own, not gear/scrolls/potions but stuff you actually \"own\". Like say you took Spellcraft which gives +1 save boni vs. spells for every 5 points of it, but you didn't). You don't own potions or gear, so please do not include them in the calcuations. It's OK after setting out all those naked stats, followed by your buffs, skills (the stuff you own) to show what Vick might look like in reasonable gear (say, +6 to a stat, +5 weapon or something like that), but after the naked stats followed by stuff you actually own. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso OK (and in fact it's a really good idea) to point out the weaknesses and mention how to go about i.e. shoring up the will save with clarity potion (or mind-blank scroll, assuming UMD). This way we know that you know, and lets players who may not know about these things know. WIll save is typical weakness of meleel generally speaking (also one of the easiest things to shore up PvM/E); players might find stuff like that helpful to know, but don't over innundate them with gear--might give them the wrong impression (i.e. that he's gear-needy, when epic WM ain't).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of calculating AB, Damage and AC, here you go: <br/>\nAB: BAB (30 here) + STR Mod (or DEX if a finesser) (+12 at 34 STR)  + feats (+1 WF, +2 EWF, +1 WF), + WM SWF (+7 w. 28 of it): 53 as Mick sets out. <br/>\n<br/>\nAC calc: AC = 10 + armor bonus + shield bonus + dodge bonus + natural bonus + deflection bonus + other AC. In this case, 10 Base +1 Dex +4 Tumble (cross-class) +2 AS: 17 (Naked). +8 Mundane Plate: 25 (tower would add +3 and another source for more in terms of gear, but using a 2-hander you can't use a shield, though). I know there's something about \"mounted combat\" potentially giving a dodge bonus (once per round, attempting a ride check for a potential +1 AC for every 5 of the check result over 10 ( no penalty if the check result is under 10); however, for this to apply must actually be mounted and train the ride skill (comes with benefits as well as penalties, but gotta love that where properly enabled rider gains HPs, AC from their mount). Please don't include that cool tumble stone you get in your world (I see where that extra is coming from, heh). Your Naked AC is 17, not 21. Mundane Plate adds +8, for an AC 25, yes? I know, dodge gives a +1 on current attacker, but that's 26; unless you're in expertise mode (+5 ac, -5 ab) in which case you deprived yourself of some AC there, as would take it to 30 (+1 dodge). If that's what you meant, then you cheated yourself out of a bit of AC.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDamage: weapon (Greatsword: 2-12) + STR Mod (12 x. 1.5 2-hand boni: 18, +6 WS/EWS, or: 2-12+24 .<br/>\n<br/>\nFear DC on PDK is 10, +PDK level and STR Mod, not Con, as Mick points out. Its a fear spell, duration tied to PDK level, and easily negated (Protect v. Alignment scroll or spell, clarity potion or mind-blank scroll ... If want to see a really cool \"fear\" DC, check out that of a raging Barbarian with terrifying rage (runs off the intimidate skill), just saying). Bard would be better here (skills like tumble (AC), listen (very useful PvP especially), UMD for things like the mind-blank scrolls among so many other things, with a much better inspire courage, curse, etc. and more of it) but we've lots of those already. <br/>\n<br/>\nNice to see PDK used in a build, something a bit different around here (thanks for the build!). Hey, is there full horse support in your world? Think it would be cool to see one of these guys mounted, maybe doing the archery thing (feats to decrease the ab penalties when mounted, etc.) and thus getting the whole ride AC boni and all that good PDK stuff coming into play; would be nice to see. Meantime, cool build. You hit (AB), you damage. Simple. <br/>\n<br/>\nRide ON ~ Tyr.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
