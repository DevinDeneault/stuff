You'd think that would make it easier for me but I'm still really struggling with the stat spread. I was thinking something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nRace Human<br/>\n<br/>\nS 14<br/>\nD 8<br/>\nC 10<br/>\nI 14<br/>\nW 16 (21)<br/>\nCh 14<br/>\n<br/>\nThen feats would be something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n1 power attack, WF Longbow<br/>\n3 divine might<br/>\n6 ZA<br/>\n9 Improved Critical: Longbow<br/>\n12 ???<br/>\n15 ???<br/>\n18 ???<br/>\n20 ???<br/>\n<br/>\nAny suggestions? I am open to different races but I kind of like roleplaying humans (I am not very imaginative I guess). Thanks in advance!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Not sure you need 14 INT. <br/>\n16 Wis should be sufficient. Have 14 STR for damage, 8 DEX 10 Int, 10 or 12 for CON, spend evertyhing for Charisma.
