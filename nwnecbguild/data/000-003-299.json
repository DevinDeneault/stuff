Now that I've fiddled with it, I'm wondering what STR really does in such a scenario; does it boil down to extra damage, two-handed weapon compatibility, and a slightly higher AB? It was fun to pla around with and to learn from, but now it seems pointless, lol.

      "content": "<div>I like your class mix here Jim,<br/>\n<br/>\n As for your question, i think the answer is really obvious, isn't it?<br/>\n<br/>\n Rogue builds with Epic Dodge generally have two big weaknesses, the first is low (really low) fortitude and will saves, and the second one is damage against targets that sneak attack does not affect (golems, elementals, undead, e.t.c.) So when you are going with the admittedly difficult road of both strength and dexterity main stats and take CoT instead of fighter you try to create the perfect warrior (kinf of) suppressing these weaknesses close to zero. When you have the backup of 28 natural strength, sneak attack seems more of a bonus and you can relax and play however you want, defence will still be very good even if you end your dexterity at a natural 25, mathematically being 4 points more than a full plate warrior in a +5 environment and you also have Epic Dodge covering your back as well. Now add to that the strong saves that come from having that many CoT levels and you can see where this is going. And you don't miss a whole lot by going this way either, at worst case maybe a couple points of AB/ AC from a normal full dexterity rogue. But again this is okay because full dexterity rogues have in general excessive amounts of AC so even if we fall back by 2 or 3 points it won't really matter.<br/>\n<br/>\n This all is true until we get to high magic worlds however, there the bonus damage on weapons covers everything and having strength also as a main stat is indeed pointless, but then again many things are in said scenarios.<br/>\n<br/>\n On to the build itself now, i am impressed the way you used HS in order to get the additional couple of stat points, well done :)<br/>\n<br/>\n I think though we can make it a bit better, especially that AB of yours. Here are my suggestions,<br/>\n<br/>\n 1) Exchange Opportunist with Crippling Strike, arguably a better feat to have, although look-below, you may not have to take it at all except if you keep the same your build's level split<br/>\n 2) Exchange Strong Soul with Luck Of Heroes, again a better feat to have although i understand you took it for theme reasons<br/>\n 3) Change your pre-epic level split to Rogue 12/ CoT 8, then with your CoT 10th level at Epic grab Epic Prowess (+1 AB)<br/>\n 4) Change your Class Split to (Rogue 17/ CoT 18/ HS 5), that will get you a CoT bonus feat in place of a Rogue bonus feat, but you will gain another +2 to all your saves plus you can take Armour Skin as well (+2 AC)<br/>\n 5) You will have to drop Expertise entirely from the build, since you will have one less feat from the reduced CoT levels pre-epic. Not a big loss since you really do not need it in this build<br/>\n 6) Take the \"Big Effects\" first, EWF deserves to be far earlier in your build, same with WF<br/>\n 7) Lower your \"Open Lock\" skill in order to bring your \"Search\" skill to a modified 42 for auto-detection of Epic Traps, (tip from HipMaestro, that guy is an expert in skills)<br/>\n 8) Similarly bring your \"Stealth\" skills to almost maximum, they are an opposed roll after all and should be as high as possible. Take points from \"Listen if you must\"<br/>\n 9) Just 16 points in \"Set Traps\" will bring you to a modified (+2 from synergy, +7 from dexterity) 25 ranks that will allow you to set all deadly traps there is<br/>\n<br/>\n Overal this is a pretty sweet build, having 28 strength with a two-hander and those saves plus 9 dice of sneak attack (for the modified version of it) plus UMD/ Deadly traps and lots of combat feats such as Improved Disarm/ Knockdown will be a very fun character to play with loads of options!</div>"

I'm not sure how that works. Thanks for the info on the UMD, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n When I suggested\u00a0that\u00a0Bard, RDD, CoT combination, <span style=\"color:#000000\">I didn't consider they\u00a0</span>wouldn't get the required feats for ED. Rogue / Bard / RDD is a good call. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n I fell in love with a more \"traditional\" (?) Rogue, Fighter, CoT non-ED STR-build\u00a0that I'm working on now that I think will try simultaneously with\u00a0this build, simply to see what style of play I like better. That one's got little to do with this thread, really, so I've spoilered it below. The level spread is a little unusual, but I thought it kinda worked out as a good compromise to reach goodies in all three classes (love its abilities,\u00a0stats, and feats to death - and the 420 hit points made me giggle). Feel free to comment on it, I don't know that it needs it's own topic other than maybe answering if I'm being silly with the level splits.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\n<br/>\n Fighter(10), Champion of Torm(15), Rogue(15), Elf<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 17 (30)<br/>\n DEX: 15<br/>\n CON: 12<br/>\n WIS: 8<br/>\n INT: 14<br/>\n CHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n Elf: (Hardiness vs. Enchantments, Keen Sense, Low-light Vision, Skill Affinity: Listen, Skill Affinity: Search, Skill Affinity: Spot, Sleeplessness)<br/>\n 01: Rogue(1): Luck of Heroes<br/>\n 02: Fighter(1): Ambidexterity<br/>\n 03: Fighter(2): Toughness, Two-Weapon Fighting<br/>\n 04: Rogue(2): STR+1, {Evasion}, (STR=18)<br/>\n 05: Fighter(3)<br/>\n 06: Rogue(3): Weapon Focus: Longsword, {Uncanny Dodge I}<br/>\n 07: Fighter(4): Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br/>\n 08: Rogue(4): STR+1, (STR=19)<br/>\n 09: Fighter(5): Weapon Specialization: Greatsword<br/>\n 10: Fighter(6): Weapon Focus: Shortsword<br/>\n 11: Champion of Torm(1)<br/>\n 12: Champion of Torm(2): STR+1, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Blind Fight, (STR=20)<br/>\n 13: Champion of Torm(3): {Smite Evil}<br/>\n 14: Champion of Torm(4): Knockdown<br/>\n 15: Champion of Torm(5): Great Fortitude<br/>\n 16: Champion of Torm(6): STR+1, Improved Knockdown, (STR=21)<br/>\n 17: Champion of Torm(7)<br/>\n 18: Champion of Torm(8): Iron Will, Disarm<br/>\n 19: Champion of Torm(9)<br/>\n 20: Champion of Torm(10): STR+1, Improved Disarm, (STR=22)<br/>\n 21: Fighter(7): Epic Will<br/>\n 22: Fighter(8): Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br/>\n 23: Fighter(9)<br/>\n 24: Fighter(10): STR+1, Epic Weapon Focus: Shortsword, Epic Weapon Specialization: Greatsword, (STR=23)<br/>\n 25: Rogue(5)<br/>\n 26: Rogue(6)<br/>\n 27: Rogue(7): Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword<br/>\n 28: Rogue(8): STR+1, (STR=24)<br/>\n 29: Rogue(9)<br/>\n 30: Rogue(10): Epic Fortitude, Defensive Roll<br/>\n 31: Rogue(11)<br/>\n 32: Champion of Torm(11): STR+1, (STR=25)<br/>\n 33: Champion of Torm(12): Great Strength I, (STR=26)<br/>\n 34: Champion of Torm(13)<br/>\n 35: Champion of Torm(14): Epic Prowess<br/>\n 36: Rogue(12): STR+1, Great Strength II, (STR=28)<br/>\n 37: Rogue(13): Crippling Strike<br/>\n 38: Rogue(14)<br/>\n 39: Rogue(15): Great Strength III, (STR=29)<br/>\n 40: Champion of Torm(15): STR+1, (STR=30)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 420<br/>\n Skillpoints: 280<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 38/29/33<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses: Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +3<br/>\n BAB: 29<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 43 (melee), 32 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 20/30<br/>\n Spell Casting: <br/>\n Alignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\n Discipline 43(53), Tumble 40(42), UMD 41(40), remaining skillpoints 156<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(32)<br/>\n 02: Discipline(5), Save(31)<br/>\n 03: Discipline(1), Save(34)<br/>\n 04: Tumble(3), UMD(3), Save(38)<br/>\n 05: Discipline(2), Save(40)<br/>\n 06: Tumble(2), UMD(2), Save(46)<br/>\n 07: Discipline(2), Save(48)<br/>\n 08: Tumble(2), UMD(2), Save(54)<br/>\n 09: Discipline(2), Save(56)<br/>\n 10: Discipline(1), Save(59)<br/>\n 11: Discipline(1), Save(62)<br/>\n 12: Discipline(1), Save(65)<br/>\n 13: Discipline(1), Save(68)<br/>\n 14: Discipline(1), Save(71)<br/>\n 15: Discipline(1), Save(74)<br/>\n 16: Discipline(1), Save(77)<br/>\n 17: Discipline(1), Save(80)<br/>\n 18: Discipline(1), Save(83)<br/>\n 19: Discipline(1), Save(86)<br/>\n 20: Discipline(1), Save(89)<br/>\n 21: Discipline(1), Save(92)<br/>\n 22: Discipline(1), Save(95)<br/>\n 23: Discipline(1), Save(98)<br/>\n 24: Discipline(1), Save(101)<br/>\n 25: Tumble(17), UMD(17), Save(77)<br/>\n 26: Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(85)<br/>\n 27: Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(93)<br/>\n 28: Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(101)<br/>\n 29: Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(109)<br/>\n 30: Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(117)<br/>\n 31: Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(125)<br/>\n 32: Discipline(8), Save(121)<br/>\n 33: Discipline(1), Save(124)<br/>\n 34: Discipline(1), Save(127)<br/>\n 35: Discipline(1), Save(130)<br/>\n 36: Tumble(5), UMD(5), Save(130)<br/>\n 37: Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(138)<br/>\n 38: UMD(1), Save(147)<br/>\n 39: Save(157)<br/>\n 40: Discipline(5), Save(156)<br/>\n<br/>\n Lots of different feat customization options to shy away from the particular \"of the Blade(s)\" theme I've chosen. The feats that I feel are the build's \"required\" feats are listed at the bottom, so I'll personally cycle any feats but those when re-using this schematic. I've maxed out the essential skills this build needs and left the 156 skill points remaining unallocated for customization.<br/>\n<br/>\n Variation feats:<br/>\n Called Shot: Great for dual wielders, but I feel has limited ROI.<br/>\n Armor Skin: I can do without the extra 2 AC, but it will depend on the PW (I don't PvP).<br/>\n Power Attack: Always handy when you have a high AB and want to add more damage, and can benefit very well from alternating two-hander and two-handed (vs. lots of hit points and vs. high DR, respectively).<br/>\n Expertise: I don't really use this, but with Taunt (which this build would need to take cross-classed, to boot), I understand it can be exploited. It should be said that the AB should be comfortably high enough for it, and would allow tanking really well.<br/>\n Weapon Proficiency Exotic: Allows for \"a better longsword\" (bastardsword) and the two-bladed sword, which both fit very well, thematically (and disarming with the latter counts as a large weapon - it's a question of which versatility you prefer, I suppose). In this build's original state, I've prioritized more item properties from two weapons when dual-wielding, over one set on a double-weapon - and I already have a two-hander that counts as a large weapon for disarming.<br/>\n Epic Weapon Specialization: Shortsword: This would land more damage and you'd ditch the longsword focus in pre-epic, probably.<br/>\n Greath Strength IV &amp; V: Increase the AB and damage by +1 each. You'd lose the EWF for any of the extra dual wield weapons; you could, however drop one of the Epic Save feats for something like the EWF: Shortswords (I'd pick Epic Fortitude since that save is the highest as-is).<br/>\n<br/>\n If I really wanted versatility over theme (weapon-wise), I'd probably get a morningstar in my main hand and a handaxe in the off-hand, for covering all three damage types in my attacks at once (I might just do that when I start playing him, TBH).<br/>\n<br/>\n \"Required\" feats:<br/>\n EWS in any two-hander for the benefits of the highest AB &amp; STR, disarm, and overcoming damage resistance.<br/>\n Saves-related<br/>\n Dual-wield related<br/>\n Blind Fight<br/>\n Knockdown (Improved Knockdown may be skipped if desperate enough)<br/>\n Disarm<br/>\n Improved Disarm<br/>\n<br/>\n I chose Elf for personal reasons (and for the \"always on\" search mode), but Human should be able to get the same starting ability scores, the extra feat at level 1 (Strong Soul would be my choice), and 43(?) more skill points.<br/>\n<br/>\n I also don't care about XP-penalites (and I build for level 40 power), which this has starting at level 10 (Elf), but that a Human wouldn't have at all (I <em>think</em>).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n -JimDandy</div>"

It was AWESOME!<br/>\n<br/>\n OK, I'll post the Blades-build on it's own in here first for finalization and feedback on the paths I see as optional that I started listing, and then I can list it with those variations in the 40's section. I'll be playing him in WoG for testing.<br/>\n<br/>\n And you know what else? I'm realizing if I made a pretty <em>female </em>RDD it's suddenly not such a bad class to play with\u00a0(is that sexist and half-dragon racist? I feel a character theme coming on!), so I'm am gonna look at a version of a STR-based Epic Dodger build.\u00a0I've long been a fan of Tyr's detailed and passionate work;\u00a0I'll look at hers and many others for inspiration. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks for compliments and encouragement!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n -JimDandy</div></div>"
