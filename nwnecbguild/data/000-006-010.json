Mirnaia also made a very viable tweak of upping the Wisdom at the expense of Constitution, which clearly worked. I took the build in its initial version through full testing lately, and both are fine. I'm including the entire thread from the Build Request forum below, as I believe it merits the coverage (and I'll be linking it to the Mines of Twin Summit thread in the Modules forum), as well as showcasing Mirnaia's exemplary assistance, and you can choose which better suits you. I did have a back-story for the build, but it was based on the character being female, which would rub against the grain of Mirnaia's testing, so I'll leave it for another time. (Oh, and I'll write up a proper Skills Schedule for the initial build as soon as I can - I still input here directly, so it takes a bit of time). Hope you like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo well!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's another one for your consideration. Assassin was beginning to make me twitch, so I did some reverting to type...it's a Monk!

You're all welcome to try, of course! (Oh, and I'll be working up some kind of back-story while you carve him/her up.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT 3</em></strong>: I've got the character story - hence the change of thread title. She is a follower of Moradin's bride, Berronar Truesilver. That's all you get for now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT 4</em></strong>: Really should stop with all the editing. However, I thought it worth mentioning that I did find a sort of mirror build to this one in the Legacy Archive. Back in 2005 Kaliban came up with <strong>Tempered Steel</strong>, which is a Monk 9/ SD 5/ DwD 26, with the same starting and ending stats. He does go for dual-wielding kamas (giving a d-w AB of +40), meaning Blind Fight is lost and Imp Crit and W Focus are taken in epic levels. ED is not reached until L39. His HPs are 470, but that's because he takes an Epic Toughness at L40, and his naked AC is 32. He does get DR of 18/-, but I'll trade that in for all the other goodies Truesilver's Hand has tucked away.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I would be immensely grateful if someone was prepared to give this a test run. I'd love to, but something is corrupt in the heart of Neverwinter for me at the moment, and it simply will not load. The thing is, I really like the look of this one (might be a bit sticky until the mid-late teens), and I would like to post it as a tested build in the 40s section. It's my first really unique take on a build (I think), and I would like to unleash it on an unexpecting world. But I can't without your help.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, any brave volunteers, please? Virtual beers and/or cakes, together with massive kudos is all I can offer, I'm afraid.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Oh, and if someone is prepared to give it a go, I'd go for full Discipline as the spare skill, with a few points in Lore.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If it had been a game-changer I'd have included it in the \"mandatory\" list of skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually quite like the shift to 12 Wis from Con. Swings and roundabouts on the Fort/Will saves axis. More importantly, this build is about not getting hit (ED, Concealment, AC, SR, DAII, Hide and MS, speed, etc), whereas Con is for when you do get hit, and whether you can handle it. Thus it's a smart idea, thanks. (I just get twitchy with dwarfs who can't handle a mountain dropping on them, but that's my problem - much as the Discipline thing is down to my proclivity for Str builds.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said, my only concern about MTS is about a few areas with hundreds of baddies with DR.

I mean, look at the guy's face, that's way more like 12 Wis than 8 :) I was also toying with the idea of 14 Int at the cost of Con and leaving Wis at 8, but didn't find any really useful skill for MTS. For Aielund, I'd do it and max Persuade for a cooler RP experience, if you can stomach the idea of a dwarven diplomat.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the beginning with such builds, you're struggling for AC, especially since you don't have any kind of concealment yet (and no UMD). AB isn't sky-high either. I gracefully skipped over the most painful bits, as a pure dex-monk is probably the weakest low-level character, but there's nothing to do about that other than suck it up (or skip it, like I did!)<br/>\nI quickly ditched the initial robes for Vestivius' +5 robes and haste boots, an unbuffed AC of 37 is comfortable in the beginning of MTS. I didn't kill V because I wanted the cloak, but just for the heck of it, honestly, I didn't remember what he dropped.<br/>\nThe effects of Def stance can definitely be felt, but there are still too many 20s. I can't wait for ED and Empty Body.<br/>\nHiPS is ridiculous as always. Pull with a bow, hide, mess up the stragglers. Or assassinate the caster, hide, reposition. MTS features many true seers, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE SPEED IS GOOD.<br/>\nMinotaurs outdoors + 3 risen monks (West, East, South) -\u00a0 barely beat one minotaur pack unbuffed without tricks, rushing in, using IKD. With potions, I lost 1/2 health, with bow/HiPS abuse (i.e. playing intelligently), virtually nothing. Potions make a big difference, but I'll try and only use them when it'd get really rough otherwise. Same for drinking healing potions.<br/>\nBadric residence - I always get freaked out when the Minstrels use EYE RAYS. (I play on HC, petrification makes you a Peter forever.)<br/>\nSewers lvl 1 - poison immunity is nice against the spiders. Sewage cubes generally missed their acid attacks, have 10 DR against fist. Also, because I was lower level, fewer ones spawned. I didn't know it was a thing in MTS. Needed drinks after several battles. Umber hulks are a joke. Hit level 16. Getting 13 HP with 10 Con feels weird :) Confirmed, at level 16, more cubes spawn, take forever (3-4 rounds per cube) to kill. Being Hungarian, I take offense at not being able to solve a cube quickly. Against 5-6 cubes, had to HiPS away and heal, even with potions active, or abuse the terrain to separate them.<br/>\nWhite Wolf Inn - maybe ditching Discipline was not such a good idea against Taunts. HiPS to the rescue.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

However, I have no intention of using wands and scrolls with this one, and I already get to use juicy Monk gear. Just sticking to my mundane roots, you know? It's all about the concept, dude (can't find a dopehead emoji, sorry).<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, you're quite welcome to vary from script, but a couple of things come to mind...I appreciate you're a PW player, so xp penalties matter less, but you'd certainly hug them close with a Monk 25/ Rogue 10/ DwD 5. Second, I do like me some HiPS - it's so much less faff than potions and scrolls. Yes, this pc can be a tank, but it can also be a swift and stealthy mage-killer.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I await further feedback from Mirnaia, so am quite prepared to reverse any opinion heretofore expressed (official Stag disclaimer).<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT:</strong></em> Bloody hell - I actually got a \"couple\" down to an actual 2!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

This is really a pity. It won't matter much in MTS because you can cap every attribute, so all that DS will eventually give is 4 dodge AC and 2 save vs. all. WW inn cleared without problems, if you exclude the one reload when I got turned to stone.<br/>\nSo far, putting one point in open locks together with the ring of the rogue allowed me to unlock doors rather comfortably. This might be the first time I can complete a certain quest the proper way.<br/>\nHanded in the spider quest. ~13K for a 10-stack of heal potions is ridikkulus. I wish the module's creator limited heal access, but what the hell, it's a 2006ish module.<br/>\n<br/>\nCertain quest:\u00a0 Walked into the inn, casual like (with monk speed) - it's refreshing to have a NWN module where most NPC's you talk to are actually friendly - I always forget where the fucking stairs are to the second floor, and the inn has like a million doors - anyway, I swung over to the jeweller's shop, assassinated the owner, and discovered that the doors are DC 38 (I can get at most 32, and didn't have lockpicks), so I murdered everyone inside, and helped myself to the contents of the vault. I love the way the customers keep walking around while you are beating the guards to death and kicking in doors. I later realised the artificer sells Chimes of Opening, useable by anyone. <br/>\nI had to reload to before the quest, because the level drain the vault chests did would not go away by resting, lesser restoration or by the healing at the apothecary. The tower of thunder sells a lot of scrolls and not only mage ones, but they only sell lesser restoration, not the more powerful ones. So, from what I can see, nothing gets rid of the level loss.<br/>\nThis time I did buy chimes, and realised that if the guards ever see you (even if they don't turn hostile because you hide again fast enough), you don't get credit for the sneaky bit. So I did it again again, with +3 lockpicks (the best sold by the artificer) and inventory shuffling. Oh, the occupational commitment! I can finally just sell everything to Uther Dartmoth. He, of course, sells up to +10 lockpicks, but you need to kill McAllister before he'll trade with you. I went back to the jeweller's and murdered everyone. <br/>\n<br/>\nAid the Miners: Regular minotaurs are extremely underpowered at this point, and the cave is filled with them. The rest are nothing we haven't seen at this point, either.<br/>\nLevel 17! Flanking immunity and an extra attack. Of course, one of the minotaurs drops a greater restoration scroll. <br/>\nI kited the greater gorgons to death (I could fail my save on more than a 1.) Shoot, HiPS, repeat also worked.<br/>\nAtM part 2: The risen monk packs are tougher. They can IKD you, which they wouldn't do normally because their AB is terrible, but when they do it from stealth, the Dex bonus retention to AC is not enough to stop it all the time. Weird stuff: one of them KD'd me on a 30 (14+16) roll, I have 44 AC, Defensive Awareness II and the monk who did it was definitely visible. I have no idea what gives. I mean, if they have no chance, they won't even attempt it, and I have seen them try several times. With DA2 it shouldn't matter where they stand relative to me, should it? What am I overlooking?<br/>\nStealth&amp;detect doesn't slow me down as opposed to just stealth.<br/>\nRisen masters still give extreme XP despite not being more dangerous than regular monks: level 18! Catching up on stealth skills and tumble, doubling my crit rate :D, MOAR MOVESPEED, and finally, innate spell resistance!<br/>\nNext up: frost giants.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I shouldn't be getting hit on a 30 with 38 to 44 AC (depending on buff status).<br/>\n<br/>\nZael's Peak, Base: Huge difference between going in with and without potions. Enraged Frost Giant Berserkers have 30 AB, and I only have 44 AC buffed. They also have significantly more health than regular giants.<br/>\nZael's Peak, Summit (just clearing it so I don't have to come back): first true seers! The souped up blue wyrmlings pose no threat, breaths taken care of by Ring of Power but mostly by improved evasion. Can't get gloves with the dragon blood quest, but still, I might as well do it. Servitor of Zael + Lesser Mithril Golem packs: if you don't get the jump on them (and the Servitors have good detection) it's of course difficult, because caster. I don't have enough AB to consistently hit the golems. Against the big golem packs at the top, I need to HiPS a lot.<br/>\nLevel 19! One level away from max attack per round.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrost Giant Caves: the berserkers can hurt. I ran out of healing potions but still decided to take on the first boss, survived. He drops a ring with WS: Unarmed strike, the rings I have right now are better though than 2 damage. Warlord Jarugdon, on the top floor, drops the Moss Covered Cloak, which is a godsend (10/- slashing, bludgeoning, piercing, +3 Int, KD immunity), unfortunately, he's also wearing it while he's still alive, so it takes forever to bring him down. This trivialises many fights against trash packs that have so far been dealing an annoying amount of damage. Jarugdon has higher Discipline than what my AB allows for, and he has high AB himself, so Def Stance &gt; FoB here. The monster density in the caves is pretty insane.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's a video of the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://youtu.be/1RQVXnK1n84\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">frost giant boss fight</a>. FPS = shite. This is not for entertainment, but so that Stag can see how his build performs when played very badly. It is also unlisted. I have Tony K's AI installed. This also means the enemy doesn't have dispel, or they'd have used it. Everything that could go wrong does. Misclicked IKD, buggy engine teleporting mosters around, misclick turning attack off, messing up IKD timing (always do it on all attacks of the 1st or 3rd flurry and stick with it for the rest of the fight), bad targeting. The flashing is due to me spamming the highlight button (which I bound to Space, which I think is the most convenient thing) to force an update of monster health.<br/>\nLevel 20! Eight attacks per round. I can also summon a shadow that is absolutely useless, and once per day I can do a a 5 round DC25 daze (10+Dex mod+SD level), which might be useful against grunt bosses, should I remember that I have it. I have never used it.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I did wonder if you might go for Mordre Khan before heading to Zael's Peak - that way you'd be able to skip the ascent by using the Rak portal into Zael's base of operations, but that might be a bit premature.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately, I can't watch the vid, much as I'd like to.

Being able to knock giants off their feet is nice.<br/>\nI owed Lord Krieger a visit long overdue (actually, he'd have wiped the floor with me before.) I was a bit concerned, since he's a Blackguard, but it turned out he only has a Will save of 14, and was thus the first victim of Shadow Daze. Or, he would have, if I could do enough damage to kill him in five rounds. Thus, it became a healfest from both sides. He drops a Nymph Cloak +6 and he's high level, how come his Will is only 14?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Minions of Khor in town drop a \"Citidal Key\", with which you enter the \"Citidel of Khorinmagh.\" I went to town on the Minions and Champions, the area boss must have been a low level caster since I could resist his spells and his Elemental Shield was mostly negated by the Ring of Power. He drops a +5 robe with Flame Lash on getting hit and some fire soak, I put it on instead of the other +5 robe.<br/>\nThere was an Exiled Efreeti Lord who is KD immune and the only damage I could do to him was the 2/attack from the sonic damage on the gloves. Crits showed he has 15/? reduction (my gloves are only +3.) He still went down easily, even though I started the fight with half health and he had some support. He only drops a Ruby, which aren't worth keeping even if you know about the related MTS2 mechanic.<br/>\nThe Knights of Khor have true seeing for some reason, but they're pushovers.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Citidel\" of Fire: Going in from the gate at the CoK immediately puts you into a massive fight with true seers, including Commander Vesuvia and Commander Neroon, who immediately handed mine to me. That happened two more times until I realised I have to buff up and then run past them to the corridor. Vesuvia is by far the more dangerous of the two, some kind of BG/WM, and has DR. Neroon drops a helm with Fear&amp;KD immunity and True Seeing. The overpoweredfulness of the module begins.<br/>\nBy now I can just hack at Templar packs without any micro and barely lose anything.<br/>\nSome other miniboss who was surrounded by Templar but could be KD'd, and thus, SNIPPEN (snipe, snope, snippen), got me to level 21! Off to the epics we go, with EWF: Unarmed. Even though this level gave me +3 AB, I'm still hurting for AB anc AC, but that's what you get for not playing a cleric ;)<br/>\nMost of the boss weapon drops have AB and separate elemental damage. The designer either had something wonky in mind or didn't know the difference between AB and Enhancement Bonus.<br/>\nGeneral Nova, the fire elemental boss who does a Meteor Swarm on hit, was a joke.<br/>\nUp came the two dragon bosses, Lord Smoke and Lord Ash, and down they went to IKD. Grow larger next time!<br/>\nCome to think of it, this area might have the highest boss density in all of MTS.<br/>\nOne of the advantages of being Dex-based with HiPS that you can hide and shoot if you really don't want to get up close. This was helpful with the boss I came here for, Grand Marshal Terethoxule (the efreeti boss you mentioned), since he's flanked by two Exiled Efreeti Lords, who take a lot less time to kill with ice arrows. The Marshal has a DC31 Quivering Palm, which killed me the first time. Reload, more careful, shot him to death. Drops gloves with, again, +5 AB (not EB) and d10 fire. He also drops +4 monk/SD robes with Freedom and Haste\u2026 it continues.<br/>\n<br/>\nVolcanic Shaft: Since I was here, I thought I would pay the twin dragons Chaar and Singe a visit. IKD.<br/>\nThe Ashen Renders here were super annoying with their acid breath with very high ranged touch AB, and I was too lazy to go back and get an amulet of acid resistance from the Artificer, but I dodged and weaved my way through.<br/>\nWhen you really don't want to be counterattacked, you can KD on the first flurry, and hide right as you deliver the third, then repeat.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll exit through the Fire Giant Citadel, and I'll then have everything cleared to the West except for Khorinmagh himself.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Maybe Stag'll be able to view it that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, I forgot that gloves don't have EB normally. But EB on proper weapons is also scarce until the second part. I believe it's intentional, because the mods on the weapon are never superfluous, it's just a strange design choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm positive that when I get a collection of good gloves, or can actually put that fire damage to use, things will be a lot faster. I do enjoy this playthrough (and I didn't remember you can get +5 gloves in the OC, whoopsie), there are many things I didn't even know about this module until I started playing with this toon. The lack of innate Str will eventually make much less of a difference when I get to cap it at 26. It's still isn't terribly slow, and the dreaded (makes you sleepy) Mithril Golems have no bludgeoning DR. With high Dex, HiPS and IKD there are very few situations you can't handle, even if they are more challenging because I can't yet burst things down. The Daughter of Zael + 2 Servitors of Zael + 4 Elder Thunder Elemental packs in Zael's Lab will be\u2026 interesting, though.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

There's just so many of the magic-spamming bastards (and iirc they have true seeing) that it's bound to be tougher with a dex build.<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually end up finishing MTS1 at around level 24, but maybe, with two 3/4 BAB classes in the build you might make 25.

Pleased to hear it. I've usually been an AS first EP second type, but what you say makes absolute sense. And the (effective) immunity to sneaks helps with keeping the AC up anyway. I'll confess, one of the reasons I went for the CON rather than WIS bump at chargen was knowing that Dex wasn't going to be screwed by sneaks after level 17.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I know you won't be strapped for cash atm, but you can always sell the beastie. As for kamas, iirc the part 1 boss (forgotten his name) drops a couple of good ones at the end. (When you decided to go for testing in MTS I was half-tempted to suggest going for a single kama over fist (more for the one you get from the Travelling God in part 2 than anything), but then remembered the ludicrously op gloves you start accumulating - and the damage output - so didn't.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. I'm sure you'll remember to keep hold of 2 copies of Zael's signet, 'cos one gets used up, and it's never wrong to be able to grab 100% immunity to electricity.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Good to know about Shadow Daze, thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n5 and 7. If he did name it after himself, it was a weird decision to call it \"Ruins of\" rather than \"City of\". Didn't exactly bode well, did it? I'm really pleased this bit went so well.

The way I usually do this is that I run a lap around the outer rooms, then the inner rooms, and then the middle area.<br/>\n\"Thunder Packs\": There's eight of them in the outer rooms. 4 Elder Thunder Elementals, 2 Servitors of Zael, 1 Daughter of Zael. They go relatively painlessly (they can spot you), knocking the Daughter down, then taking out the Servitors, losing about half my health (but the casters drop CCW potions). I was expecting worse. The Servitors do get their Stoneskin up, which does exactly nothing against a +5 weapon. The true seeing helm helps a lot, then switch it mid-combat once the casters are down.<br/>\n<br/>\nA detour to the Tower of Thunder: this place is filled with sorceresses, who are a joke with the normal AI script, and bloody dangerous with Tony K's AI. This is why I wanted to have the acid resistance ring with me. Turns out it was trivial with the amount of SR I had, I only had to watch out for the few Servitors who were there.<br/>\nLevel 24 after the last pack, d20 fist damage!<br/>\n<br/>\nInner lap: Grand Sorceress Sylvia died in a single round, followed by the rest of the casters in the room. <br/>\nHigh Alchemist Morgan: immune to KD, starts with Storm of Vengeance. Turns into a blue dragon for phase 2, which CAN be knocked down. I mostly evade the Storm ticks, only taking moderate Acid damage, while it kills the Battle Horrors around the boss. In one of the rooms opened by a boss key, I get a restock of Cat's, Bull's, and Owl's, but I haven't really been using them for a while.<br/>\nI enter one of the boss rooms and completely miss the presence of Loremaster Celestria, who also turns into a blue dragon upon death. The aura ticks and hits from the four different kinds of elder elementals make me pay the price in the form of 2 heal potions.<br/>\nShin the Despised: he can hit me reliably when not knocked down, but I can HiPS away from him and the other samurai, who drop heal potions. All in all, the lab has been a rather chill experience.<br/>\nMiddle room: I stalk around the edges, knocking mithril golems over the head, before engaging the rest. I shoot at a servitor which somehow pulls Zael to me, both phases go smoothly with plenty of knockdowns.<br/>\nLevel 25! I have plenty of Lore now, which can come in handy in the transition from MTS1 to the early parts of MTS2. I also get Shadow Evade. The only thing worth mentioning about it is the +1 dodge AC, but it's only for 5 rounds and can be dispelled (well, since caster level = character level here, only Morded.)<br/>\nFor the real Zael fight, the dragon form, which becomes a red dragon somehow, petrified me on the first attempt. Next, I killed the 4 thunder elementals before Zael, which I don't normally do, but Zael doesn't cast in her celestial form, and I thought reducing the clutter was desirable. KD'ing is a lot easier when there aren't several godzillion other enemies around, and the second try went smoothly. There is no shortcut from her sanctum, you have to leg it to town through the Tower of Thunder teleporter.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack in town, Adrea has no dialogue for the Rak eyes, I guess you must do it before killing either of the dragons. I dropped all 10 eyes in front of her to drive the point across, maybe she'll have a bad conscience about the affair.<br/>\nHere's something I never knew: if you take Monk at level 1, you get access to the store at the Order of the Mithril Hand. They sell standard OC monk stuff, and a few original items, such as a +5 robe only wearable by elves that grants Darkvision and immunity to the spell Fear (not fear immunity.) Nothing to write home about, really.<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting ready for the endgame of Act 1. Since Vestivius has been dead since the beginning of the campaign, I'll be turning the heads in to Rutger. We're level 25, hasted, 39 AB, 39 AC - I can knock myself out easily! -, have freedom, and are immune to crit, fear, KD, mind spells, death magic, soak 15 physical, 15 of fire/electrical/cold. These are the unbuffed stats. We'll definitely need higher AC for the penultimate fight, but there are several ways to boost it. Damage is all right, can be boosted with a Fire Giant belt in exchange for death magic immunity, level 27 would be really welcome for Epic Dodge. But normally, I get to level 27 before said fight when starting the campaign at level 17, so that's not going to happen in all probability. There are no grinding spots that I'm aware of. I guess I could exterminate the town, but I'm not going to do that with this character. And it wouldn't amount to much either.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I've usually been an AS first EP second type, but what you say makes absolute sense. And the (effective) immunity to sneaks helps with keeping the AC up anyway. I'll confess, one of the reasons I went for the CON rather than WIS bump at chargen was knowing that Dex wasn't going to be screwed by sneaks after level 17.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I know you won't be strapped for cash atm, but you can always sell the beastie. As for kamas, iirc the part 1 boss (forgotten his name) drops a couple of good ones at the end. (When you decided to go for testing in MTS I was half-tempted to suggest going for a single kama over fist (more for the one you get from the Travelling God in part 2 than anything), but then remembered the ludicrously op gloves you start accumulating - and the damage output - so didn't.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. I'm sure you'll remember to keep hold of 2 copies of Zael's signet, 'cos one gets used up, and it's never wrong to be able to grab 100% immunity to electricity.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n6 and 8.

No problem whatsoever.<br/>\n2. Yeah, the good kama drops from the final boss in MTS1. MTS2 has an insane kama accessible very early. Part of the reason I suggested MTS was that I recall there are really good gloves later on.<br/>\n3. I of course didn't remember, but for some reason I still have the ring.<br/>\n6.

Admittedly, you do end up sighing, \"Oh, it's this lot again,\" but it doesn't seem to alert Zael and her girls. Shin has always disappointed as a foe, but I ain't going to complain too much.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah - proper hurty fists! Woo-hoo!<br/>\n<br/>\nHow the hell did Zael become a red dragon? She's a blue, isn't she?<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect you may be right about Adrea's Boon, which is a shame. But what's the betting she's still on guard and friendly outside her dad's place in part 2?<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the Rutger \"incident\", remember you can still go back to the market area and reap more xp from undead folk before going to the old mines - though I could only have hoped you'd reach level 25, and you may yet reach 26 before part 2. But then, you're clearly more used to high 20s levels, while I normally play more full BAB so end up at 24.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and the Zael signet - in part 2 (I think) and part 3 it's a mahussive help when cloud-surfing!<br/>\n<br/>\nAll still good - and I'm feeling happier about the build now.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT:</strong></em> Sorry, meant to mention that yes, I knew about the monk store, but was rightly talked out of purchases there by Valerfor on my first run-through, given what I was bringing with me from the OC. Then there's all that, \"Bring me the head of Shin the Defiler,\" nonsense. I confess, at one point they annoyed me so much I killed the lot of 'em, but it wasn't worth it. Ooh, but you've got loads of Lore, so you might find the grandmaster's gear is kewl. After I'd killed them, no one would trade with me, so I have no idea.

I managed to get the last hit on the fake Rutger for 1950 xp and proceeded to clear the town of minions. Risen Monks, who were somewhat troublesome in the beginning, evaporate in a couple of flurries. Adrea still knew nothing about Rakshasas, but sent me off to the final areas of the first campaign. Uther will still trade with you, but he's the only one.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbandoned Mine (this is the area outside town): It starts with Minotaur packs! Oh, how we've come full circle.<br/>\nAbandoned Mine Crypt: Jumping down the well is the absolute point of no return\u2026 forever, and is the last you'll see of the Prime Material Plane in the series. The Lord of the Pit at the end has a huge HP pool, but I manage to keep him down for most of the fight, even with all the Risen Monks and Masters around.<br/>\n<br/>\nRuins of the Silver City: the Iron Wind Servants can drain Con, but nothing a lesser restore won't fix. I clear the area and I will intentionally fail the questionings so I get to fight.<br/>\nLevel 26! Defensive roll.<br/>\nAt the tower there are four Lords of the Pit, with Improved Invisibility spells. Defensive stance makes just the difference that I can beat them up without having to heal. Even with blind fight, it's mildly annoying, but without it, it would be super annoying.<br/>\nCrypt of Sanguinius: this is where you have to fight, I believe. He's supported by two guardians, whom I take out first since they buff him up. Sanguinius has EW and Greater Ruin, but not much else. He's difficult to hit (&gt;50 AC) and hits hard. He also taunts, I hide until it wears off. He's not a true seer and can be KD'd. He drops +6 robes with death/fear/drain/sneak immunity with improved evasion and some other stuff.<br/>\nFor some reason, his area is considered comfortable, you only eat rations when you rest, and do not need a bedroll.<br/>\nCrypt of High Priestess Ellesandra Algalia: she's flanked by two dragons, Dawn and Dusk, and all of them are dangerous. I do my usual method: leg it back to the Ruins, hoping to split them up. Only the two dragons follow, I kill them in defensive stance. Back for 'Sandra, she's a very high level cleric, and turns into a dragon when killed, which is actually the less dangerous form.<br/>\nCrypt of General Jaen Za'ar: She hits very hard with a high AB, and casts Evard's, but failed her save against Shadow Daze (Will 17 vs. DC26).<br/>\nCrypt of King Leorian Kalatar: yet again two dragon adds, Photon and Nova. Yet again run out, Nova followed with his DC38 fire breath. I finished him off by kiting as he hit very very hard and often. Repeat, Photon dispatched the same way. The King has 43 AB and hits for about 40 (he has Sun's Grace, a 2d6 positive 2d6 divine greatsword) but can't see what can't be seen, so the good old hit and HiPS did the trick. He drops a +6 Str +6 Cha +death magic immunity belt to replace my old guiding light one with.<br/>\n<br/>\nAaaand\u2026 with that, level 27! Epic Dodge, here I come!<br/>\nI'm putting on a Ring of Prot +5 instead of the Ring of Power, and thus have an unbuffed AC of 46. Def stance will put it to 50, which should be enough against what's to come.<br/>\n<br/>\nTomb of the Kelsha'ra: here it comes! I can usually find a place where only one of them can attack me, but not this time, however, by the time I get Risen Khor to \"Near Death\", I still haven't taken any damage. Risen Zael is in the middle of a breath attack and thus luckily cannot heal Khor as he dies. Zael is out of breath attacks by the time I get her down, so she does heal up and up and up, but during the entire fight I took maybe 4 hits.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so we come to Maphaeldor, who has an insane HP pool, Greater Ruin, II and a few other things up his sleeve. His robes cast Energy Burst (1) on hit, which is always resisted. I need to run away to heal two times (and he has very monk speed too), but keep him down most of the time and win, end of MTS1!<br/>\n<br/>\nHe drops the Touch of the Iron Wind, a set of +7 gloves with WS:US, 2d10 negative energy and DC20 Con drain on-hit. His robes would kind of be an upgrade but I can't use them because alignment and no UMD. The amulet and belt are also rather insane, I eventually settle for not capping Dex yet in exchange for +10 Wis and some Str.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span class=\"inline-attachment\">\n<dl class=\"fileimage display\">\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/201903/10758846_0a3ec5adf3346d437205c126fc0c45d9_t.png\" />\n</dl>\n</span><br/>\nStay tuned for MTS2: Hell in Hell.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I quickly wrapped up the final scene of MTS1. I'd like to mention here that I love how Aielund seamlessly transitions between modules. Manually importing my character into MTS2, for some funny reason, makes me feel like I'm hacking the game, so to speak. I'm also always afraid that somehow this breaks continuity. The module also doesn't auto-export your character.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, time to beat up some Abishai. By the way, NWN is badass with Doom music. My expectation is that things will become easier through this module, can't go wrong with a dexer in MTS. Abishai die in 2, sometimes 3 flurries.<br/>\nI now get to choose whether to go through more abishai (very easy) or the beholder caverns (very frustrating). Of course we're going into the beholder caves.<br/>\n<br/>\nYmygryl's Caverns - No way this could go wrong. I can not quite one-flurry-kill Beholders reliably, but I can sneak up on them or shoot them and HiPS. Sometimes I just take the 5% chance to get petrified because Beacon's a gambling man. Now there are these Hellchests lying all around (which I can lockpick btw) that have supplies in them plus random Ring of Prots, from +5 to I think +9, so I'm trying to get one of those. I'm still spamming \"G\", my shortcut for quicksave. But when there are like 3 of them in a long corridor I kite: two flurries, HiPS. Goes rather quickly, too. The really annoying thing about Beholders is that you of course can't knock them down.

(Could this be the reason (besides the way they portray sexuality) why I prefer Mass Effect to Dragon Age?)<br/>\nSo I play the third level of the caves commando style, and let me say that even with MTS gear it's remarkable for a build to be able to safely take out groups of beholders and do so with several options at your disposal. I liked that, even though beholders always mean slow (but action-packed) going. Against isolated beholders I can hit from stealth, most probably win the initiative and disengage then hide immediately without the beams going off. Mind you, more often than not, they are dead *immediately* from the first flurry, but that's partly due to MTS gear (2d10 negative gloves, 20 permanent Str on a Dexer, WS from gear(!).) It sounds slow, doesn't it? Then I realise I kill monsters on the 1st flurry of the 2nd round of combat, which is pretty OK. And I make it through all 3 levels without getting stoned a single time. Beacon makes it through all 3 levels without getting stoned a single time. The best prot ring I find is +7. And I exit to THAT zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nStygian Marches, Eastern Wastes is probably the one zone with the most monsters in the game. It is huge and it has insane monster density. I just stand around and let the Hamatulas (the demons who summon skeletons) litter the floor around me. The Ancient Damned take about 5 flurries, and there are a ton of them. Looks like I vastly underestimated Epic Dodge. I thought that when surrounded, hits would still very likely slip through. But I've now killed about 30 while constantly surrounded, and have not yet taken a hit (I have 0 regen currently). That's with no concealment. Update: something hit me for 1. I'm fighting the undead with negative energy damage and constitution drain. It's also an example of when Def stance does not give you much: the +4 AC is useless here, since you're only fighting 20's.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeacon, Truesilver's hand on the dance floor! <span data-s9e-mediaembed=\"youtube\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:100%;max-width:640px\"><span style=\"display:block;overflow:hidden;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZIC2W-p3i10\" style=\"background:url(https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZIC2W-p3i10/hqdefault.jpg) 50% 50% / cover;border:0;height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;width:100%\"></iframe></span></span><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I will confess that some of my own favourite music tracks (for other scenes, of course) are from both HotU - particularly the Lith Mayar track when waiting for the horde to arrive - and Aielund, specifically when in Fairloch. I appreciate that both are NwN tracks, and neither are axe-wielding giants (in whichever sense you choose to interpret \"axe\"), but they stir my blood anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I haven't yet given proper feedback, but I've only been home for a couple of hours, so hopefully tomorrow if that's okay?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That's Monk 18, which gives me 50% (I believe undispellable) concealment twice per rest for round/lvl. One of them drops reasonable monk gear, including a pair of backup gloves better than what I had, should something resist negative energy damage on weapons. Notably, negative energy on weapons does harm undead. 5 minutes later, I find the area boss, the Keeper of the Damned (a scyther) who does resist negative energy, so I'm happy to test the new d10 fire d10 negative gloves against it. I still have trouble hitting high AC, my AB is 42 when not flurrying. Since I can't hit him reliably and therefore can't keep him down, and he can heal himself fully, it's a very long and boring fight, even though I'm in no danger whatsoever. I try shadow daze, but of course he's immune to mind-affecting. He healed about 6 times and I couldn't interrupt it once. His robes are an upgrade, but don't have fear immunity. This will be a moot point in 2 levels when I hit monk 20, but I shuffle my helm around, losing crit immunity but staying immune to fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nI exit to the west, to the River Styx and beat up the abishai. As Stag noted, I don't know what the designer was thinking with their dead, wagging bodies. Into the Cult of the Bull cave, where the minotaurs have true seeing, because why the hell not (I currently have 87 hide and move silently with some silly +30 boots), not that it matters in the outcome. The whole sequence is rather uneventful, culminating with the Bull God fight and freeing Persephone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI finish the outside area, with gloves that can stun now and 5d6 sneak attack, so it goes even faster. A sneak crit hits for about 70, and the current challenge level is best described by the fact that I maxed STR before DEX. They're weak, die fast and I'm safe so I don't really bother with KD. Off we go to the island so I can finally sell my bagload.<br/>\n<br/>\nPhlegethos Frontier: I bind at the stone, summon Phio, talk to her and realise I forgot to pick up the main quest in the beginning :) Time to pay Shin a visit.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarduuk: Adrea, long time no see. Shin gives me his quest, and I remember to visit Master Zoral in his pit, but I need to do Shin's quest first before he'll give me his. Let's see if I remember then. There are healing vendors but I used maybe 5 CCW potions so far so I'm good.<br/>\n<br/>\nI go back to clear the main zones, that is, the river banks and the areas south of them, and the abishai caves I skipped because I went beholder hunting. I hit level 29 in Vorguloth's Outer Dominion. There is a statue there that I still can't figure out what to do with, even though this is my 3rd MTS playthrough. Does it do anything other than damage you? I can unlock it with a lockpick, with the same result afterwards. There are a few Lords of the Pit, which are very easy with my improved gear. I talk to the Avatar of the Wandering God and get my first ally in MTS3 :)<br/>\n<br/>\nNext, I'll go to the probably universally most hated area in MTS2, the Horror Wood.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It's either a drab slugfest as you've just experienced (sorry about that, but at least you were defensibly prepped) or easily Dev Critted - but this is not such a build.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still haven't managed anything but ouch from that statue, regardless of build (I think there's another place like that - an altar - in the Haunted Wood as well). Don't forget the side \"door\" into Vorguloth's domain - lots of xp there, which is nice, but I missed it on my first couple of runs in MTS.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd with Persephone freed, that gives you the best kama in town (I know this isn't a kama build, but still...).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest/most annoying problem in the Haunted Wood is those damned little jack'o lanterns with petrification gaze. Save often. More than usually. I once forgot for ages and had to go through the whole sodding thing again.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and don't get over-excited about Master Zoral's gifts.

I currently also have 0 regen, partly because outlasting stoning is not an option. I'll try and be careful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only interesting thing in the abishai caves is that I make my so far record crit for 106, which I realise is the absolute most possible at the moment. 30 (5d6 sneak)+20 (2d10 bludgeoning on fists)+40 (fist crit)+16 (STR bonus crit).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the Horror Wood, Boogeymen resist bludgeoning and take increased damage from fire, while Nightmares don't resist anything but are fire immune. I swap gloves until I realise there isn't really much of a difference, and settle for the Fist of the Bull that I've been using so far anyway. This build has taught me how to play fast while using HiPS when necessary. The first miniboss, Terror (nightmare) gets me to level 30, I get THE EYES! Also, mind spell immunity, as if half the items here didn't grant that already :( I go over my inventory, and realise none of my items do that :) I also get Epic Prowess, which is pretty damn useful at this point. The Headless Horseman is immune to KD but gimps himself because he keeps whirlwinding.<br/>\nOuter Horror Wood ends with a Witch of the Harvest, who cast Storm of Vengeance but most importantly Elemental Shield, and the only fire resistance I have is a Ring of Power for 15 fire soak, not ideal.<br/>\n<br/>\nInner Horror Wood: if not for the Jacks, I could round up the entire area in one go and make them kill themselves in their own SoV's (there is an area in MTS3 where you can do that.) SoV's are still largely beneficial and I try to stand in them. Witches are true seers but speed + KD means I can usually one-shot them before OnPerceive triggers. On that note, I dislike true seeing casters (dragons excepted, where it makes sense.) They destroy the challenge of get the jump on them or get fried. That said, casters are largely not too dangerous in MTS, but still. First two groups of Jacks handled, the annoying thing is that they spawn in your face, but they can't see me while I'm sneaking, so I spawn them that way. Third group down, could it be that they only try and petrify on spawn? The combat log could be unreliable here. I grow bolder and play it that way. The Ring of Power soaks basically all of the reflect damage. I do round up the entire right half of the area (still spawning the Jacks unseen), so not getting petrified with about 20 Jacks attacking you at the same time makes it very likely that they are only dangerous when they spawn. Empty Body and Epic Dodge makes the 20s tolerable, I lose maybe 20% of my health.<br/>\nNocticula The Witch Queen, the boss, has eye rays and somehow gained 90% concealment. I just facetank her, and win with my wonderful 19% hit chance (1-0.9*0.9). Her AC and HP are nothing to write home about, it's all the concealment.<br/>\n<br/>\nSamhain's Crypt: OK, it's something different, one of the Jacks here did use petrification gas (it failed.) Don't know what's up with them. Next hypothesis: if you pull them away from their spawn spot, they won't use it. The Master of the Hunt feels really easy because I can actually knock him down and he's not a true seer. Feels like a luxury, really. His belt finally allows me to cap DEX (but lose Freedom.) His helm would be great if I had UMD. Samhain himself casts Bigby 5 (-10 AB), which is countered by my one Greater Restoration scroll, but of course he does it again. He has Wounding Whispers which in my case hit for 20, but that's not too bad, he went down easily. I couldn't help but think give me control of such a character and I'll wipe the floor with anyone. Spellcasters are weird in MTS. Anyway, this was a whole lot easier than I thought it'd be, I port back to the Sanctuary, sell the loot and go to Marduuk to hand the quest in to Shin. Right, so Shin, whom I once killed, would like me to redeem Zael, whom I killed twice.<br/>\n<br/>\nTime to dig that Signet of Zael out of my inventory.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I'm off to Nimbus Tyr and start wrecking the place. The cyclopes don't even attempt to use their confusion ability on me (or was that MTS3?) Level 32! Many many minibosses throughout the two areas, including a sword boss called Lutideous, Blade of the Wind who has Wounding Whispers and drops itself upon death. More importantly, it drops a sonic immunity ring. Level 33!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Nexus of Thunder: This is a fun boss fight, especially with a monk. Even with all four foci destroyed, Azazel has a lot of health, and has respectable AB, but Epic Dodge &gt;&gt; respectable AB. When I see Azazel, I think of the Master and Margarita, where Azazel is definitely a he, but I guess times and universes change. Back to Shin, where both Zael and Zoral want me to kill Susymog, but I'll first go to Vorguloth's inner domain because I haven't done it yet and I don't remember if there is a quest that leads you there.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Mind you, there is magic soak in MTS, I just don't have such an item, so magical damage isn't as special here as it generally is elsewhere. The damage is less than 10 per hit landed, so no big deal.<br/>\nTheir leader, Bloodfire, who dies just as easily as the rest, drops a dagger with a level 6 Inferno on hit, which is way less awesome than it sounds, it's only 2d6/round (but can only be resisted with SR), and an item with Epic Ruin 1/day, lol (I can't use it, though).<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing a dexer in MTS is awesome, as you basically don't experience THE drawback (no damage).<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe that's it for the main, connected areas of Hell, so I go back for a good night's sleep at Orwick's at 7:00 am.<br/>\n<br/>\nOff we go to Susymog. Nearing the endgame, I'm slightly concerned about my 63 AC, which is definitely too little against the final boss, I think. Let's see what loot comes up.<br/>\nThe Tower: As soon as I see the blue hell hound Bohemoths, I recall that Susymog is a blue pit fiend. Bohemoths have a giant health pool, but are otherwise unremarkable. In Susymog's chambers, when the melee miniboss is surrounded by a huge number of monsters, but only the boss has true sight, you have a very easy way to single out the boss by sneaking. Bhe Bloodfiend Reaver's reflect aura wears off after only a few rounds, when there are a lot of them, I just wait it out hidden.<br/>\nAnother miniboss, Herald Decius, puts up Wounding Whispers, but now I have a sonic immunity ring.<br/>\nThis is the point in the game where the really crazy loot starts to drop, like a +9 ring of prot with +6 regen (I take the 1 AC hit and swap it on for my +10 ring, I've had no regen for basically the entire playthrough, and it's good for a lazy person), poison and disease immunity (not that I needed those), or a helm with +8 deflection, +6 CON and STR, crit immunity, KD immunity, and true seeing, as well as the first of the +12 ability stuff. I have no fear immunity items atm, but I believe mind spell immunity protects from fear, which we'll soon find out.<br/>\nI really like MTS as a great hack and slash diversion with an OK story and a very epic scope, but if it had, say, WoG's balance, it would be the best combat module ever, not to mention it would make a lot of build choices a lot more interesting.<br/>\nLord Susymog is a true seer, the 6 lords of the pit aren't, so he is pulled alone and kept on the ground for the fight. He even rolled a natural 1 twice on his save against the on-hit glove stun. The Lords of the Pit are weaklings at this point, I just use Empty Body, Flurry of Blows, and auto-attack them to death with barely losing anything. Back to Shin, Zael, and Zoral, and off to Vistelle.<br/>\n<br/>\nVistelle: A Fallen Guardian CASTS A SPELL AT ME, and it actually works! I think it was a Curse, a Lesser Restore from the Icon of Purity (the first quest reward from MTS1!) takes care of it. The area is really easy, so far MTS2 has offered very little challenge. I know it's going to ramp up near the end. Level 35, and Armour Skin! The \"natural +2 to AC\" in the description should have gotten whoever put it that way fired. It's innate, or bonus, or additional, or whatever, but not natural, as that is a specific type of non-stacking AC. IIRC, RDD's descriptions have the same issue.<br/>\nFallen Guardians are now officially my favourite enemy in MTS: one tried to dispel the stun I put on another one &lt;3 <br/>\nI fail to notice that Sanguinius has true seeing, so he buffs up, but has so little health that even with Elemental Shield he dies way faster than I lose health. Malphaedor has a Summoned Badger (&lt;3, this is the most adorable area ever), and gets a Greater Ruin off, which fails to do anything (65 positive damage from a level 10 spell is nothing at this point.) It's a nice touch that his equipment is almost the same as MTS1 Malphaedor's (his robes and gloves are upgraded, but he drops the same kama and amulet.)<br/>\nWith all the stuff dropped, I manage to get my AC to 74, much better, and now I officially look like a professional wrestler. Pimpin' screenshots at the end. I also have STR, DEX, WIS, CON maxed and have a plethora of immunities, and 5d6 sneak attack.<br/>\nI make it to the portal room, and I'm off to Avernus!<br/>\n<br/>\nTakhisis' minions are KD immune, are NOT true seers for some reason, and are no challenge (I snipe the templars first.) Cerberus warrants Def Stance over FoB, as he has respectable AB, but mostly because it's been so long since I last used DS. He has the most HP of anything so far. His range is so long that I have to cancel DS because we manoeuvre into a position where he can reach me, but I can't reach him, and DS prevents me from moving. He drops a fire immunity necklace, which I'll be keeping because I don't want to spend half an hour shooting a certain boss down in MTS3.<br/>\nI say hi to Nicademus and take a nap at his place. He sells a sequencer, something I haven't noticed so far. <br/>\n<br/>\nRealms of the dragons: I go white - green - black - blue - red. I improved evade almost everything, making the fights far less epic than intended. Takhisis hits me twice during the encounter, and Tiamat has monstrous HP, but the breath DC's are not high enough, and neither is the AB, of which she has 66 against my 74, but with Epic Dodge it's a joke. She drops the first truly WTF item, a +10 robe with Haste and +5 everything. Takhisis gets me to level 36, and that concludes MTS2!<br/>\n<br/>\n<span class=\"inline-attachment\">\n<dl class=\"fileimage display\">\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/201904/10758846_920cf291017fbf577c99d9799dd950b4_t.png\" /></dl>\n</span><br/>\n<span class=\"inline-attachment\">\n<dl class=\"fileimage display\">\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/201904/10758846_deeaaf560b76dc1e270bafed350d6dd4_t.png\" /></dl>\n</span><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Stag, I'm really, really sorry, I'm trying to make up for it.<br/>\nIn case you have forgotten how The Hand currently looks like:<br/>\n<br/>\n<span class=\"inline-attachment\">\n<dl class=\"fileimage display\">\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/201905/10758846_b6dcb6b3a4f99c8525605b5bc81da750_t.png\" /></dl>\n</span><em>(he can only attack when burrowed)</em><br/>\n\u2026and a slew of immunities.<br/>\n<br/>\nExpectations: I expect to crush my enemies. Only concerns are Elemental Shield, but I have a fire immunity ring, which, as I begin the third module, can't find in my inventory for some reason. Found it! It's an amulet that drops off Cerberus. I also have items with cold and sonic immunity, 20 acid soak, so I'm rather well prepared for reciprocal shields, including the really nasty one near the end of this module.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the remaining 4 level-ups, there isn't anything extraordinary to look forward to, just the rounding out of the character; one more great dex, the last tumble dunp, more sneaking. I'll have reasonable AB (very much enough for MTS) and very good AC. My worst save is 36. Now, I would still have no chance against an intelligently decked out true seeing wizard (unless monk speed &gt; OnPerceive, but that depends on luck and the availability of corners), but there is no such thing in this module.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-- Show me a god whose ass I won't kiss --<br/>\nLet's begin by picking up the quests from all the gods I'm allowed to visit, as well as some of their sidekicks, plus Shin and Zael, before going to Jurassic World. I surprise myself by actually taking notes of the ingredients. As I mentioned before, this is the third time I play MTS, and I always use map pins in the central hub to remind myself of whose support I already have. I'm planning on keeping a list at the bottom of each entry, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI begin with music, then Death (note#7!), Faery (Puck's quest, note#1, Honeydew silk for Zael, Shard of the Purest Essence with I think is an ingredient for the super weapon, or a red herring), Travels, Life (note#2), and the Lost World!<br/>\nThe scorpions here are hardly worth mentioning, they are here for underleveled characters to catch up. You could probably get away with a fairly low level character as long as you play carefully and have a way of losing them (or just use your Astral Sextant!) I don't really know their AC but maybe even a level 12 zen archer cleric could do fine, as long as haste, through domain or items, were available. It could be a fun challenge to see how low level a character you can beat MTS3 with - if you can survive early you should be able to catch up quickly. But I digress.<br/>\nBeacon is now single-handedly responsible for the mass dinosaur extinction (I really wish I had UMD and could Meteor Swarm them for bonus points in style). Tyrannosauruses have way too high discipline for KD and are immune to it anyway, and while Stegosauruses don't, they are immune to KD as well. Note #3 is here. I actually miss quite a bit on my lower AB attacks, so I decide to go without FoB. They have 51 AC, which is of course not too much at this point, but seems to invalidate my previous train of thought about a low level character (unless you BBoD + GS or some such.) I'm not very well versed in low level abusive building. Tyrannosauruses, I believe, are black dragons with the head replaced with that of a lizard. They swipe with their forepaws.

I took the build in its initial version through full testing lately, and both are fine. I'm including the entire thread from the Build Request forum below, as I believe it merits the coverage (and I'll be linking it to the Mines of Twin Summit thread in the Modules forum), as well as showcasing Mirnaia's exemplary assistance, and you can choose which better suits you. I did have a back-story for the build, but it was based on the character being female, which would rub against the grain of Mirnaia's testing, so I'll leave it for another time.

You're all welcome to try, of course! (Oh, and I'll be working up some kind of back-story while you carve him/her up.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT 3</em></strong>: I've got the character story - hence the change of thread title. She is a follower of Moradin's bride, Berronar Truesilver. That's all you get for now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT 4</em></strong>: Really should stop with all the editing. However, I thought it worth mentioning that I did find a sort of mirror build to this one in the Legacy Archive. Back in 2005 Kaliban came up with <strong>Tempered Steel</strong>, which is a Monk 9/ SD 5/ DwD 26, with the same starting and ending stats. He does go for dual-wielding kamas (giving a d-w AB of +40), meaning Blind Fight is lost and Imp Crit and W Focus are taken in epic levels. ED is not reached until L39. His HPs are 470, but that's because he takes an Epic Toughness at L40, and his naked AC is 32. He does get DR of 18/-, but I'll trade that in for all the other goodies Truesilver's Hand has tucked away.</div></blockquote>\n\nI really like this defense Monster. Furthermore, there is room to customise the build.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
