I'll move the second post on page 2 to the lead post, which it should be, as soon as things allow.]</em><br/>\n<br/>\nAfraid you don't get rid of my current obsessions quite yet. Torlin is one of those southerners from Brune I've mentioned. He was the King's First Guard and Champion until he disgraced himself somewhat while he and the King were at a revel in a brothel on foreign soil, and must now bring himself back into the King's favour up in the frozen north. There is little nuance to the man (except a couple of personality issues, which we might address in some insights into his life later on): all he's ever been good at is fighting - and he does it bloody well (or perhaps just plain bloody).<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than the sub-par AC - which I can do little about without losing something elsewhere - my main question is about whether I could improve the sequencing of my feats and levelling. Your advice would be welcome (though no one's yet commented on my new interpretation of <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/choke-light-hand-rogue-20-barbarian-15-harper-scou-t2355670-s10.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Choke Light-Hand</a>, btw - just saying...)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Arvin Torlin</strong><br/>\nFighter 8/ CoT 10/ WM 22<br/>\nHuman - any non-evil<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Stats</strong><br/>\nSTR 17 (34)<br/>\nDEX 13<br/>\nCON 14<br/>\nWIS 8<br/>\nINT 14<br/>\nCHA 8<br/>\n<br/>\nHPs: 520<br/>\nAC: (naked) 17, (full plate) 25, (+tower shield) 28<br/>\nSaves: Fortitude 30 Will 20 Reflex 28. +4 v spells<br/>\nBAB: 30<br/>\nAB: (max, melee) 51, (ranged) 32<br/>\nDev Crit DC: 42<br/>\nSkills: 215.

That funereal grey light before the sun crawls up that has no colour in it. Few faces abroad, and those that were made ghosts. The empty country turned into the land of the dead. Torlin's favourite time of the day. \n\n\n He pounded through the camp of Debruca's division, a sprawling maze of canvas all in blissful, sleeping silence. Mist clung to the flattened grass, wreathed the closest tents, turned distant ones to phantoms.\nHis servants were waiting for him in the clearing outside his tent. Unrinc brought him a bucket and he drank deep, cold water running down his burning throat. Younger brought the case, straining under the weight, and Torlin slid his practice blades from inside. Great, blunt lengths of battered metal, their pommels big as half-bricks to lend some semblance of balance. Three times the weight of his battle steels, which were already of a particularly heavy design.\nIn wonderful silence they came for him, Unrinc with shield and stick, Younger jabbing away with the pole, Torlin struggling to parry with his unwieldy iron. They gave him no time and no chances, no mercy and no respect. He wanted none. He had been given chances before Filstrava, and allowed himself to grow soft. To grow blunt. When the moment came, he was found wanting. Never again. If another moment came, it would find him forged from steel, sharpened to a merciless, murderous razor's edge. And so, every morning for the last four years, every morning since Filstrava, every morning without fail, in sun or rain or snow - this.\nThe clonk and scrape of wood on metal. The occasional thud and grunt as sticks bounced off armour or found their marks between. The rhythm of his ripping breath, his pounding heart, his savage effort. The sweat soaking his jacket, tickling his scalp, flying drops from his visor. The burning in every muscle, worse and worse, better and better, as if he could burn away his disgrace and live again.\nHe stood there, mouth gaping, eyes closed, while they unbuckled his armour. When they lifted the breastplate off it felt as if he was floating away. Off into the sky, never to come down. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></details>\n\nCheers</div>",

      "content": "<div>Just had a thought that might help playability or not. Given that those skill points I forgot, while nice, are far from necessary, you could drop INT down to 13 and lose 2 points in CON (making it 12), then boost STR to a starting 18, still finishing on a final 34. That means you could lose one Great Strength, and if you did it early enough (maybe even level 21), you could then shuffle all the bonus feats up a few levels and finish with an Epic Toughness at level 40, so you'd only forfeit 20 HPs. Might be a viable option?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd sorry, Max, I somehow missed your input on both WF/Dodge and the Liam Neeson line - don't know how. As far as the pic goes, I couldn't get everything I wanted. Some had the sword and shield but had helms that completely hid the face, while others had the right look but the wrong weapon. He's supposed to be a bull of a man, clean-shaven, with closely cropped hair, and this was the best I could find.

It's a great build, but dual-wields kukris and therefore lacks both KD and Blind Fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the old search engine are another four builds of a similar nature.<br/>\noli84's (yet another posting name for billb0) F8/ CoT10/ WM22.<br/>\nMithdratates' Master of Melee, which is a F10/ CoT10/ WM20 with EDRIII and Dev Crit at level 39, but uses a Scythe without taking EWP: Exotic.<br/>\nCinnabar Din's Rock Warden, which is a CON-heavy (28) EDRIII dwarf with no Dev Crit, but which makes for an excellent tank with a decent AB of 45. It's a F8/ CoT10/ WM22.<br/>\nAnd Kail Pendragon's Dwarven Master Slicer, another F8/ CoT10/ WM22, which is again a dwarf with EDRIII and no Dev Crit.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, plenty of entrants, but most serve different purposes, so I believe Torlin remains a viable occupant of this forum.<br/>\n<br/>\nI must apologise for not being able to make the appropriate links to the above builds.

      "content": "<div>Ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 27, build performs well, but as I feared, things are slowing down somewhat.\u00a0 I have had to go to great lengths to get the build outfitted (in my preferred environment, WoG - YMMV) appropriately, to face the many facetted opponents and their abilities, skills (yes, WoG opponents make great use of certain skills ala Taunt, etc), and magicks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, with what immunites and abilities that I could bolster, I have.\u00a0 Still working on getting enough SR to toss caution in the wind atm.\u00a0 Still, the build is performing well.\u00a0 Not absolutely great, as one would have thought it would, but well enough.\u00a0 Probably because Dev Crit has been nerfed <em>HARD </em>on WoG (and the expected downturn of Fort saves has not followed) - it is just inevitable that the opponent will roll a 1 (and with a crit range of 10~20, this build threatens crits ALL.THE.TIME!). I will say that my by now infamously known bad luck with dice rolls means that instead of an expected 1~2 crits a round (dependingly), I normally see around...1 every 10? attacks?\u00a0 That seems about right.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think something is weird in the Tony K AI.\u00a0 If I test this build, for example, with the normal AI (I use the PGCC with CEP) to do this, and I do not experience oneses like I do on WoG.\u00a0 In fact, the rando vanilla generator seems to be rather unbiased, as far as it can be and I can tell.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot the same with WoG.<br/>\n<br/>\nExamples I have really noticed are when extremes are present (meaning, one can only miss the opponent on a 1, regardless of the -5 AB chain in one round) and I am using things like IKD and ID (improved knockdown and improved disarm).\u00a0 Even when factoring in the -4 AB malus to the attempts, I still need a 1 roll to miss.\u00a0 That is the test foundation.<br/>\n<br/>\nFacit : Vanilla Bioware AI lets me basically do this and succeed as one would expect, with only occassionally a 1 roll for failure.\u00a0 Everything is normal, and WaD (working as designed).<br/>\n<br/>\nWoG with Tony K's AI - 1 roll on first attack 80% of the time! O_o\u00a0 Failed followups 50% (meaning yes, more 1s in the SAME round!!).\u00a0 This will continue for, oh, 2~3 rounds, then sharply drop off to equal normal vanilla AI rolls (whereby the opponent in the same timeframe will often roll nat 20s, multiple times when \u00fdou are missing, then it drops off as with the 1 rolls).<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect Tony did this on purpose to make each combat \"exciting\" - but that is just my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, enough of a rant here, back to the build - I am really pleasantly surprised by the saves.\u00a0 They are extraordinarily good!\u00a0 True, they are boosted by gear (something one can do in my play environment), but still...very nice (not that it is really helpful for me, as I am often plagued by 1 rolls).<br/>\n<br/>\nI am looking forwards to how the build continues to perform as levels rise towards and into the 30s.</div>"

AC deficit (IF I am in an area where there is no KD, I can equip some +6 boots).\u00a0 This deficit did not show until recent levels (because a 45 AC at pre 30s is not too bad, but as levels climb, so too the AB of opponents).\u00a0 As it is now, I am facing opponents that easily hit AC 60 (meaning they only miss me on a 1, and crit me constantly).\u00a0 Getting critted for 100+ every time (and in a group, that can mean 600+ damage in one ROUND!!!
