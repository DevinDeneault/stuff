      "content": "<div>This determined young person is a charming fellow. He wants to become a great mage. He is wise enough to understand that he has great magic talent, but alas, he is not smart enough to realise how to best pursue his goals.<br/>\n When he starts studying for wizard, he has already learned how to use simple magic devices and how to scribe scrolls. He sits up at night reading in the magical light he conjures - while his bat is out flying, doing whatever bats do.<br/>\n When he passes the first wizard graduation, he is well paid. Suddenly he can cast light more often. It does not bother him that he cannot figure out yet how to cast the more advanced spells. He probably just has to study much harder.<br/>\n As he keeps studying, his lore becomes formidable. He becomes widely known for his knowledge and his ability to identify the rarest items.<br/>\n At some crucial stage, his work pays off. All the efforts have made him brighter and he understands basic spell casting. Now he soon learns to identify things with the help of magic. He also learns how to make his light silent so he can sit up longer reading when his fellow students have gone to sleep. He also learns how to summon animals that can play with his bat familiar.<br/>\n He firmly believes that a mage never should need to carry a weapon, but rely on his own natural abilities when in trouble. He is a determined fellow and reads some books on oriental martial arts, just to be prepared.<br/>\n<br/>\n Please enjoy the career of<br/>\n<br/>\n The Epic Scholar (Bard 1/ Wizard 39)<br/>\n<br/>\n RP 1-40<br/>\n<br/>\n Elf, any non-lawful alignment<br/>\n<br/>\n Abilities:<br/>\n Strength 8 (9)<br/>\n Dexterity 10 (11)<br/>\n Constitution 6 (7)<br/>\n Intelligence 9 (11)<br/>\n Wisdom 17 (21)<br/>\n Charisma 18 (21)<br/>\n<br/>\n 1) Bard 1 Scribe scroll<br/>\n 2) Wizard 1<br/>\n 3) Wizard 2 Skill focus Perform<br/>\n 4) Wizard 3 Wis +1 (18)<br/>\n 5) Wizard 4<br/>\n 6) Wizard 5 Craft Wand, Brew Potion<br/>\n 7) Wizard 6<br/>\n 8) Wizard 7 Cha +1 (19)<br/>\n 9) Wizard 8 Iron Will<br/>\n 10) Wizard 9<br/>\n 11) Wizard 10 *<br/>\n 12) Wizard 11 Wis +1 (19), Skill Focus Concentration<br/>\n 13) Wizard 12<br/>\n 14) Wizard 13<br/>\n 15) Wizard 14 Skill Focus Lore<br/>\n 16) Wizard 15 Con +1 (7), *<br/>\n 17) Wizard 16<br/>\n 18) Wizard 17, Weapon Focus Unarmed<br/>\n 19) Wizard 18<br/>\n 20) Wizard 19 Dex +1 (11)<br/>\n 21) Wizard 20 Great Intelligence I (Int = 10), Epic Skill Focus Lore<br/>\n 22) Wizard 21<br/>\n 23) Wizard 22<br/>\n 24) Wizard 23 Str +1 (9), Great Intelligence II (Int = 11), Epic Reputation<br/>\n 25) Wizard 24<br/>\n 26) Wizard 25<br/>\n 27) Wizard 26 Improved Critical Unarmed, Still Spell<br/>\n 28) Wizard 27 Cha +1 (20)<br/>\n 29) Wizard 28<br/>\n 30) Wizard 29 Improved Unarmed Strike, Combat Casting<br/>\n 31) Wizard 30<br/>\n 32) Wizard 31 Cha +1 (21)<br/>\n 33) Wizard 32 Epic Will, Silent Spell<br/>\n 34) Wizard 33<br/>\n 35) Wizard 34<br/>\n 36) Wizard 35 Wis +1 (20), Spell focus Conjuration,\u00a0Greater Spell Focus Conjuration<br/>\n 37) Wizard 36<br/>\n 38) Wizard 37<br/>\n 39) Wizard 38 Epic Skill Focus Concentration, Spell Penetration<br/>\n 40) Wizard 39 Wis +1 (21)<br/>\n<br/>\n * No bonus feat available<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 82 (max) (45 min)<br/>\n<br/>\n Saves: (fort/refl/will)<br/>\n 14/18/34<br/>\n<br/>\n Skills: UMD 4 (9), Lore 43 (57), Concentration 23 (34), Perform 0 (8)<br/>\n<br/>\n Spell casting:<br/>\n Caster level: Wizard 39, Bard 1 (penetration +2)<br/>\n Bard: 2 cantrip slots<br/>\n Wizard: 4 cantrip slots, 4 lvl 1 slots<br/>\n Suggested spells:<br/>\n Cantrip: Light<br/>\n Lvl 1: Summon creature I, Light (silenced), Identify<br/>\n<br/>\n Unarmed combat:<br/>\n AC naked: 10<br/>\n AB: +19/+14<br/>\n Damage: 0-2 (19-20/x2)<br/>\n Bard song: +1 to AB and damage for 10 rounds, once per day<br/>\n<br/>\n The Mighty Bat:<br/>\n Str 3, Dex 15, Con 8, Int 3, Wis 14, Cha 5<br/>\n HP: 150 max<br/>\n Saves: 21/24/ 18<br/>\n Skills: Hide, Move Silently, Search, listen, spot<br/>\n AC: 14<br/>\n AB +34/+29/+24<br/>\n Damage: 1d4 +1 slashing, +5 sonic<br/>\n Other: Bite +5 enhancement, Damage reduction 10/+4, Spell resistance 18, Fear Gaze (DC 29) 4x/day, Fear howl (DC 19) 4x/day, Immunity to mind-affecting spells<br/>\n<br/>\n Edit: Corrected\u00a0the error and changed\u00a0Epic spell focus\u00a0to <em>Greater</em> spell focus</div>",

      "content": "<div>Hey Mick!<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Nice\" build <br/>\n<br/>\nThis reminds me of a campaign i played with a really strict DM. He didn't use Point Distribution cuz he said all characters looked alike, he preferred rolling 3d6 to get starting stats and he wouldn't allow you to reroll. Anyway, my stats weren't as bad, but one of my mates got REALLY unlucky in his rolls so that his higher attribute was 13 and he got all odd number too. He then made a Fighter out of it, putting 13 on Strength and a 12 on Constitution and the result was \"CALVIN, THE PEASANT HERO!\" He was actually able to survive all the way to level eight, where he perished due to a poor sense of profession and an unrealistic view of his own talents. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for bringing back these fond memories of my PnP days.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Haha Max, really a nice story :D<br/>\n My only PnP experience was a half-elf ranger a few years ago. I had no problem with my stats (we rolled 4d6 and the worst dice was removed), but one time I had an end-of-the-day encounter with a lone wolf at the edge of a village where I almost died. I was around lvl 8-9, naturally a wolf is not a problem for a ranger at that level, but I constantly rolled between 1-3 for attack, and that wolf between 15-20, also had a crit once... when my HP fell to 0, the DM said that I regained my conciousness in an unfamiliar room, my whole body was in pain, and I couldn't even sit up properly. Soon a very old women came to the room, and when I asked her about what happened, she said laughing that she saw the whole \"battle\". When she realized that I didn't play with that wolf and I was in real trouble, she came out to me and chased away that poor animal with a broom and dragged my uncoscious body to her home, and actually she saved my life:D<br/>\n<br/>\n By the way Mick, you can't take that ESpF: Conjuration at lvl36, Greater SpF is a prereq for it :)</div>"
