Those who attack the Dwarven Wall learn the full meaning of futility as their blows bounce off his incredibly hard form. Those who stick around afterwards will learn what the afterlife holds in store for them, as the Dwarven Wall neatly separates their head from their shoulders with devastating

Author</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nEquipment<br/>\nGreatsword<br/>\nFull Plate Mail <br/>\n<br/>\nDefensive Capabilities<br/>\nHeavily Armoured: Combining both a combat hardened skin and full plate mail, the Dwarven Wall is a walking tank. He is also able to keenly observe an enemy's movements in combat and expertly deflect incoming blows with his own attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAcrobatic Grace: The Dwarven Wall may not look it, but he is an accomplished acrobat, being able to dodge and tumble out of the way of incoming blows. He can also spring suddenly from one position to another during combat, surprising his enemies with his speed such that they are unable to make an Attack of Opportunity at him.<br/>\n<br/>\nDefensive Stance: 15 times per day the Dwarven Wall may become the literal incarnation of the phrase \"the immovable object\". With bonuses to his strength, armour class, constitution, and saving throws, he is extremely durable and fiercely damaging when in a Defensive Stance.<br/>\n<br/>\nHealthier than a Horse: The Dwarven Wall has a theoretical maximum hit points of 780 due to his very high constitution, training as a Dwarven Defender, and his innate Toughness.<br/>\n<br/>\nHarder than Adamantine: With Damage Reduction of 30 that applies to all physical attacks, the Dwarven Wall is literally harder than Adamantine (which has a mere 20 Damage Reduction). Many opponents will have trouble even scratching the Dwarven Wall while the Dwarven Wall is dishing out the pain with startling ease.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrong Mind, Stronger Body: The Dwarven Wall has tremendous fortitude and above average will power, allowing him to resist many physical and magical attacks with ease. He is blessed by his patron deity Torm with an improvement to all saving throws and his Dwarven Heritage has made him harder to affect with spells or poisons.<br/>\n<br/>\nMagic Item Priorities: When shopping at the local adventurer's mall, along with the standard weapons and armour, the Dwarven Wall should try to acquire equipment which provides elemental damage reduction and resistance to mind influencing effects. With these, the Dwarven Wall can become practically invulnerable.<br/>\n<br/>\nOffensive Capabilities<br/>\nThe Basics: The Dwarven Wall has a firm mastery of the basics of combat, with a solid Attack Bonus of +41, 4 attacks per round, and a base damage of 2d6 +14. When fighting creatures immune to critical hits, the Dwarven Wall will only have trouble if their Damage Reduction is greater than 25, since he can use the Power Attack ability to dish out extra damage at the cost of accuracy.<br/>\n<br/>\nDevastating Critical Hits: With Improved Critical, Dwarven Wall will threaten a critical hit on 1 in 5 attacks. If he can obtain a Keen greatsword, this expands to 1 in 4 attacks. When a critical hit is confirmed, it will be a life threatening experience. First, there is the huge amount of damage from a high base damage and Overwhelming Critical. If that's not enough, they also must make a Fortitude save of DC 48 or be slain instantly by the mighty blow.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhirlwind Attack: Perfect for when the Dwarven Wall is getting swarmed by annoying little enemies, with a quick graceful twirl and a flick of the wrists, he can lash out at every enemy near him simultaneously. Combined with his high base damage, good critical threat range, and devastating criticial hits, the Whirlwind Attack will give a huge helping of pain to anyone foolish enough to be attacking the Dwarven Wall.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat Cleave: The Dwarven Wall possess the awesome ability to cleave right through his enemies and follow through to strike another foe. With the Cleave and Great Cleave feats, the Dwarven Wall can do this every time he kills an enemy, except while executing a whirlwind attack, which is already hitting every enemy once.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
