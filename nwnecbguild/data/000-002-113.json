      "content": "<div>Recently I've been doing some testing in EE and I noticed that dispel has changed slightly. Instead of Dispeller Level + 1d20 vs Caster Level + 12, the formula seems to be DL + 1d20 vs CL + 11 (with ties dispelling the effect). As a result, 25 caster levels are now required to be immune to Greater Dispelling instead of 24.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Its good to explore and question the basic mechanics of dispelling it is something of interest to everyone!<br/>\nIt is a well established maxim, the dispel mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is more that could be done that I am unsure if you have done already<br/>\nFirstly to see the patch notes history to see if there is a changelog that shows it being reverted to what was intended originally. If it is in a changelog, then you are already on a winner and the wiki should be updated.<br/>\nIf it isn't in a changelog then some more details on the testing. Put it for peer review, here is a friendly environment with an experienced group of players. Afterwards the NWN Wiki talk page would be the next place to post it, it is a pity WhiZard isn't active anymore, but perhaps The_Krit, who runs the NWN wiki would be the ideal person to check the data.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIf testing is needed a possible design would be two players in a character creator arena in vanilla NWN.<br/>\nI would try to avoid having the dispeller having spell focus: abjuration (or GSF/ESF) just in case it affects dispel mechanics, I am unsure if it does but the less variables for testing the better. Dispel rolls unfortunately don't show in the combat log (unless you know of a way to make it show), but the character sheet of the player affected showing a log with the effect dispelled is probably more than adequate.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom a player perspective its always handy to have a few caster levels beyond 24 anyway for those pesky UMD users with their Mord scrolls that DM's like to put on em :)<br/>\nThe breach will still apply but some buffs like bull's strength, death ward, freedom, improved invisibility and protection versus alignment can't be breached<br/>\nI think 26 is enough for Mord scrolls which are CL 17 (havent done the math) but if this change is proven then it shifts things up by one RE 'undispellability'</div>"

      "content": "<div>The testing I did was already in a vanilla environment (EE v80.8193.13). I tested it with OnHit weapons (including Holy Avenger), scripted dispels, and vanilla Greater Dispelling. Any dispel that works by using the Holy Avenger item property or the hardcoded EffectDispelMagicAll and EffectDispelMagicBest functions is affected. Arcane Defense and Spell Focus don't affect vanilla dispels in any way, the only thing that matters is caster level.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor environments that use a custom dispel system there might not be any changes, it depends on whether the system uses the hardcoded dispel functions or not. When I made a custom dispel system I didn't use either of those functions so it's definitely possible that some environments won't be affected.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Holy Avenger and OnHit: Dispel do work differently, but they're similar enough that I'm confident this new formula (with CL 10) also applies to the HA dispel.<br/>\nI'll summarise what I've found below, although this might only be accurate for vanilla EE (v80.8193.13).<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter doing some more testing with dispel and HA, it seems that either the wiki is wrong or EE has changed a quite a few functions. The HA wiki page says that HA dispels petrification and extraordinary effects like Aura Of Fear or Turn Undead. Although HA can dispel magical petrification, I haven't seen it dispel any extraordinary effects (including extraordinary petrification). Both Aura Of Fear and Turn Undead are magical effects and thus can be removed with a dispel spell (tested and confirmed in PGC3).<br/>\n[<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Holy_avenger#Notes\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Holy_avenger#Notes</a>]<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery effect has a caster level and a subtype, which are both are relevant to dispels.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe caster level is a non-negative integer, (usually) ranging from 0 to 509. Effect caster level is different to caster level in the usual sense, although for most actual spells they do match up. For example, the polymorph effect of Dragon Shape has a caster level of 10 regardless of how many Druid or Shifter levels the user has. At the extreme end, some spell-like abilities such as an Assassin's Improved Invisibility have a caster level of 509 due to a quirk in NWN. A CL 499 dispel does not dispel an Assassin's Improved Invisibility but a CL 500 dispel does. Note that the 509 CL only affects dispelling the effect, the duration of the effect is still 1 Turn per Assassin level.<br/>\n[<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Talk:Sequencer#Sequencing_Feats\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Talk:Sequen ... cing_Feats</a>]<br/>\n<br/>\nThe subtype is an integer and can be one of four categories: Error (0), Magical (8), Supernatural (16), Extraordinary (24).<br/>\n[<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwnlexicon.com/index.php?title=Subtype\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://nwnlexicon.com/index.php?title=Subtype</a>]<br/>\n\"Error\" is my label for the first subtype, there isn't an official name for it. Most combat feat effects (CS Arm, CS Leg, Crippling Strike, KD/IKD, Taunt) have a subtype of 0. Despite this, in practice they actually work like either supernatural or extraordinary effects. There is no way to create an effect with a subtype of 0 via the toolset, although it might be possible using third party programs like NWNX.<br/>\n\"Magical\" effects can be dispelled, are removed by resting, and are removed by death. \"Supernatural\" effects can not be dispelled, are not removed by resting, and are removed by death. \"Extraordinary\" effects can not be dispelled, are removed by resting, and are removed by death. All effects created in the toolset are magical by default, although they can be changed to supernatural or extraordinary effects. Despite the toolset description claiming otherwise, EffectTurned is a magical effect by default rather than a supernatural effect.<br/>\nNote that some spells remove effects regardless of subtype, such as Freedom Of Movement or the Restoration spell line. For example, all AC decrease effects, including the extraordinary Barbarian Rage, are removed by the Restoration spell line.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is one item property (HA) and four dispel spells (LD, DM, GD, MD) that can dispel effects.<br/>\nHoly Avenger is a hardcoded item property, as far as I'm aware there's no way to restrict or alter how it works.<br/>\nThe dispel spells all use a function (\"spellsDispelMagic\" from \"x0_i0_spells\") that uses the hardcoded functions \"EffectDispelMagicAll\" and \"EffectDispelMagicBest\" to dispel effects. The restrictions of not dispelling petrified creatures or creatures flagged as dispel-immune comes from \"spellsDispelMagic\", not the hardcoded dispel functions.<br/>\nIn my tests I applied a permanent magical petrification effect (CL 0) and dispelled it with both HA and a CL 1 EffectDispelMagicAll effect. I was unable to remove supernatural or extraordinary petrification effects (CL 0) with either HA or a CL 40 EffectDispelMagicAll effect. So the HA dispel is identical to a CL 10 EffectDispelMagicAll effect.<br/>\nTheoretically, if the restrictions in \"spellsDispelMagic\" are removed then there would be no difference between the dispel effect of Holy Avenger and the dispel effect of OnHit: Dispel Magic Level 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hardcoded dispel functions will only work on magical effects, they don't work on error, supernatural, or extraordinary effects.<br/>\nWhen attempting to dispel a magical effect with the hardcoded functions the check is Dispel Level + 1d20 vs Effect Caster Level + 11, with ties resulting in the effect being dispelled.<br/>\nHoly Avenger dispel is effectively a special case of a CL 10 EffectDispelMagicAll, with the same formula and subtype restrictions applying.<br/>\nSo Lesser Dispel (CL 5 max) requires 15 CL for immunity, Dispel Magic and Holy Avenger (CL 10 max / CL 10) require 20 CL for immunity, and Greater Dispelling (CL 15 max) requires 25 CL for immunity.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: I recently did some more testing with dispel. Holy Avenger only dispels magical effects and it only triggers a dispel attempt when the attack does physical damage to the target (elemental damage won't work). There is a slight inaccuracy in the post, permanent supernatural effects can not be removed by resting but temporary supernatural effects can be removed by resting. As a result there's no real difference between temporary extraordinary effects and temporary supernatural effects with regards to removing them. Everything else has been double checked, including the dispel formula and the inaccurate toolset description of EffectTurned.</div>"
