If you don't need it, then for DevCrit build, I recommend swapping Epic Prowess as well, for two Great STR feats.<br/>\n Scimitar/Rapier are overused, but for a reason. Considering high damage bonus you get in epics from STR and weapon enhancement/damage effects, crit profile increases damage output better than base weapon die.<br/>\n Scythe is definitely best option if you go two-handed, for the same reason.<br/>\n<br/>\n If you have acces to armor with no Arcane Spell Failure, the build can be tweaked to use it. For example if you can get Mithral Shirt, and choose to use a two-handed weapon, you won't need Still Spell, nor Heavy Armor Proficiency. Take Lingering Song, Toughness, or KD instead. Or rework DevCrit build to free more epic feats for Great STR.<br/>\n \u00a0</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

base damage.<br/>\n - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br/>\n Anyway... a rather long evaluation for your build to digest follows...<br/>\n<br/>\n Bearing in mind that there are different focus in most of the legacy builds, there is some value in publishing a semi-clone like yours where it can be accessed more easily right here on the ECB.\u00a0 But let's evaluate the closest ones briefly, assuming that the class split is an optimization by itself...<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Ithacan's Undead Dragon Skald</strong>: very similar, but DevCrit w/o Blind Fight and pre-v1.69 (EMA taken illegally); low HP; commits to taunt but will do poor vs. opposed taunts; skill set not fully optimized though does contain detection skill<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Ithacan's Undead Dragon Skald with Elf Ears (v. 3)</strong>: also similar but suffering from the same shortcomings of the human version, but even worse skills and a perform level only good for song 8; this is not a taunter either; this one seems to comply with v1.69 so that's a step in the right direction<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Wildeyes' Revised Avatar of Ruin:</strong> very hard to assess this build but it's a halfling so would need to go 2H with scimi; it's DevCrit and lacks essentials like Blind Fight;\u00a0 it's not a DEX build so is not able to take advantage of most of the race bonuses; this is not a taunter either<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Herbie Shimmer's Bard 14/RDD 10/PM 16:</strong> build not optimized and splits increases between STR and DEX; a good one to ignore regarding this split<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Zhoreb's Grim Bard:</strong> finally figured out this was another elven version, the build is very hard to follow; starting split is not optimized (no benefit from DEX 12 with a Cat buff available); a real odd feat sequence with Curse song and Heavy armor in epic;\u00a0 this was DevCrit so suffers from the same disease as other feat-starved versions;\u00a0 must have been built for a server with plenty of gear enhancements to compensate for the poor build choices<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Grimnir77's Black Widow:</strong> a DEXer; seems an odd choice to me without any feat to protect the loss of DEX AC;\u00a0 at least it can fight well against concealment, though;\u00a0 definitely the opposite direction from most<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Wi11oW's Singing Kukri's:</strong> gotta admit... extremely unusual with a DevCrit dual-wield kukris;\u00a0 problem is without being able to taunt and even with bard song (no curse song either), the DW AB just won't cut it.\u00a0 All-in-all not a dominating combat presence but very unique.<br/>\n<br/>\n I realize I grabbed a few more builds than necessary but by sampling others, the trend is easier to uncover, at least for me.\u00a0 One thing I can't figure is the trending focus in rapier.\u00a0 Makes no sense to neutralize the effect of Keen Edge with a weapon type that won't qualify.\u00a0 I suspect most builds were intended to be played where the Keen property appears on all melee weapons including clubs.\u00a0 But that's assuming a lot IMO.<br/>\n \u00a0<br/>\n Now for my own reshuffle of the lead build.\u00a0 Understand, I don't build RDD myself because of where I play most of the time, in environments that have rebalanced the exploitation classes in order to encourage diverse builds among its community of players, but for those who can implement them as per their default...<br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\n<br/>\n Brd14/RDD10/PM16, TN/CN/NE/CE Human\u00a0 (I'll call the version a <em>\"Winged

set.\u00a0 For +1AB/+1dmg, the toon loses 1 DEX AC and a much more powerful skill set including boosting saves vs. spells.\u00a0 Pedestrian saves are a weakness of this build and need all the help at hand.<br/>\n<br/>\n This MUST be a taunter.\u00a0 Period.\u00a0 Else, it certainly won't be optimized for most environments.\u00a0 The Expertise/Taunt combo could raise your active mundane AC to at least 76 when fully buffed so consider that feat.\u00a0 Besides raising the attack potential, taunting provides a means to deal with high-level casters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n The contradiction of the feat selection Still Spell without any Concentration deserves questioning.\u00a0 Offensive casting for a Bard 14 is mediocre at best with poor DCs and penetration so ends up more of a convenience than an actual offensive threat.\u00a0 However if considered important nevertheless, loses its viability without securing the casting action itself.\u00a0 Besides the vulnerability to casting interruption, there are opposed taunts to consider.\u00a0 Still Spell and maxed Concentration are joined at the hip (no pun intended).<br/>\n<br/>\n The key focus of this build is the two songs.\u00a0 That's where the real strength lies. Caster level 14 spell buffs (other than epic ones) are easily dispelled and should not be depended on (PM levels add only duration, not indispellability or caster level).\u00a0 But the songs are relatively stable so Lingering Song makes some sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, keep in mind that Extended buffs must be cast without armor/shield equipped or fail miserably with hvy armor/tower.\u00a0 If you are not assured getting access to all the standard pots, even Scribe Scroll/Craft Wand makes a lot of sense since item casting cannot be interrupted. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n The most glaring weakness of this build (IMO) is the lack of a detection skill, probably Listen.\u00a0 I'd have no problem reducing UMD down to a level to use divine scrolls/wands (10-15 points should be plenty) and slide the rest into Listen.\u00a0 Combined with a constant buff of Amplify, it will help avoid wading into a mass of stealthers... melee, ranged or caster types.\u00a0 <em>See Invisibility</em> will not spot GS-users, but Listen will, the moment they start to move or cast a spell.<br/>\n<br/>\n Note the slight rejuggling I made in the pre-epic levels to get regular Tumble and UMD dumps and the priority to heavy armor, all for better early playability.\u00a0 Actually, until Bard 10 and ext haste, there is little need to extend buffs so it can be delayed.\u00a0 I suppose a case could be made for ext Darkness's usefulness so shortly after bard 7 works. Most important is an early AB bonus (WF) and Curse Song.<br/>\n<br/>\n Obviously, you are concerned about getting KD'd or disarmed, else you would not be as neurotic about discipline levels.\u00a0 I can't justify the investment in Epic Discipline, though.\u00a0 You'll be getting a +2 boost from a cast of Bull and another +2 from song 11.\u00a0\u00a0 With as high an AC rating as you can reach, I doubt seriously that the penalties from the opposed special attacks will provide many opportunities to hit your toon.\u00a0 Improved Disarm spam exploit is about the only exception so keep a spare weapon handy on your gear swap.<br/>\n<br/>\n Use whatever scraps of information or suggestions contained here.\u00a0 I have no intent of professing ownership, just passing on items for your consideration.\u00a0 I'd recommend retaining your build, but with better optimizations and, of course, a skill schedule to match the level-up guide.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Your new ability spread will be different with better skill distribution (and I made a typo on the Still feat calling it \"Silent\" *doh!*), but otherwise tried to stay as close to your original template as possible.\u00a0 All the similar builds using this class split mature late but that is the nature of the combo and no getting around it without nerfing your combat stats significantly.<br/>\n<br/>\n Keep in mind that many players looking for a build to play will just grab a copy of one they like and start to play it without questioning the \"trivialities\".\u00a0 If you are able to provide the most playable version, they will appreciate the foresight and effort.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
