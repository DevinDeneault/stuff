      "content": "<div>I've recently returned to NWN:EE after a year or year and a half away, left due to a Private Shard demanding money and DMs pretty much harassing me 'till breaking down to crap.<br/>\nDecided to give the game another chance and tried Arelith and am having lots of fun thus far. Sadly my friends dont play as much as me and thus to make sure I'm not leaving them all too far behind I decided to reroll \"something\".<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what I'm looking for is a stealthy (super stealthy) type assassin character without the assassin class, as I'm new I cant pick that one yet.<br/>\nRace is either Drow so I get to explore somewhere new or any elf so I can explore elsewhere. As fighting veterans with mega runic &amp; enchanted gear, scythe weapon masters and spellswords and everyone pretty much have a pet I'd want to do burst focused damage and if that doesn't work a safe way to gtfo. Defence vs knockdowns and crits would be nice as well. Any class goes as long as it's as stealthy and stabby as possible. I'd even throw in pale master but not sure how that would fit. <br/>\n<br/>\nIdeas?</div>"

If True Seeing isn't modified to what it should be, then I understand. But I was never hit by Truestrike. It lasts 6 secs, just run and hide, hit him again.

HiPS can still be exploited for insta-stealth, but you'll never surprise anyone. I wouldn't go stealth for PvP in this case. It is true that it is hard to balance it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSent fra min SM-G950F via Tapatalk<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>"
