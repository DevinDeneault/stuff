A man who worships death itself, and has a consistent but highly impopular moral code. I was talking to a friend, who was helping me do these builds, and he made me the suggestion of making him a Strength-based toon, but I just never could envision Grimgnaw being STR-based for some reason. I think he's more of a silent, quick and merciless killer. So I made him a DEX-based Monk / Assassin, with some Fighter on the side to help with damage output. Although he is technically more Monk than Assassin, less than 18 levels of Assassin would jeopardize him too much in what he's able to do because of NWN mechanics. As is, he can paralyze (with Death Attack), stun (with Stunning Fists) or IKD his foes, killing them very fast, and with 16 levels of Monk, he can also run quite fast. He comes in in stealth, attacks one foe, if he's surrounded, casts a Darkness spell and then delivers his opponents to his master one by one. He can disable all traps, but set only all deadly ones, not epics. Ohh if only he could've been Human...<br/>\n<br/>\n My fellow guildsmates: Grimgnaw!<br/>\n<br/>\n Monk(16), Fighter(6), Assassin(18), Dwarf<br/>\n<br/>\n Alignment: Lawful Evil<br/>\n<br/>\n

I didn't know that, as my Nathyrra build did exactly that on WoG. So, there are many leftover points in Disable Traps that you can relocate into Set Trap (if you can BUY epic traps). Also, a few points from Search could be removed. Feel free to edit them around. I will eventually, when I have time!<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
