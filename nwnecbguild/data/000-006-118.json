This build doesn't make much use of the Bard features and songs, which kind of makes it strange, because you don't invest levels (at least Bard 16 for a VERY GOOD Song), but you invest the feats onto it (Lingering Song and Curse Song). So maybe you can split the difference and go for Bard 16 / RDD 10 / CoT 14. You lose 1 feat (IKD) and a bit of saves, you get much better Bard spellcasting and Song. You'll still be dispellable, but your GMW will give a full +5 to your Scimitar (although playing in the OC that's irrelevant).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, you're taking Epic Prowess before Epic Weapon Focus. That's typically the other way around. Better to take +2 AB first then +1 AB second.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt first glance, these are the improvements I can suggest.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>",

You could then drop this Epic Toughness and get another Great Strength, plus the bonus feat from CoT 22 for another Great Strength. You'll need to delay DevCrit a little bit, but IMO it's worth it. You get 5 bonus feats from CoT in epics (8, 10, 14, 18 and 22): OC, then DC, then EWF, then AS, then EP. All your general feats go to Great Strength, and Voil\u00e1, you get yourself +1 AB, damage and DevCrit DC. And you have 2 skill dumps in epics, at 27 and 37, which are more than enough to keep your Tumble AC relevant.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you went from CoT 7 to CoT 18 and ended up in CoT 28 in your edits\u00a0LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>",
