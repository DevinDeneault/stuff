Epic spell focus provides you a dracolich when using Epic Spell: Dragonknight. But, the dracolich isn't exactly powerful.<br/>\n - Rogue levels give you reflex saves for many spells. Your DEX makes your save pretty decent. Then add +8 from Protection from Spells, and +6 from spellcraft. Those flame arrows aren't touching you.<br/>\n - HP Looks low. From gear you can get +8 CON/INT, and then just buff the two stats. Giving you 24 CON/42 INT.<br/>\n - Use Magic Device.. Mass heal scrolls!

Only the strongest counts. So, that would be Mestil's acid shealth. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe spell focuses in Abjuration are very impacting, too. Probably the reason why almost every caster takes it!<br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>Empyre65 wrote:</strong>I guess you meant that second Spell Focus in Conjuration to be Greater Spell Focus.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will be those who will scold you for \"wasting' skill points on Appraise and Lore and Bluff.

I didn't take disable trap, or open lock because you can easily get a fey familiar for that. With 'Find Trap' spell, you can reveal the trap and have a fey familiar get rid of it. Which is usually the route I go. With appraise, you easily make 75k gold/hour on arelith, which is why I took it. Capped out at 20, so I only put 20 points in. Bluff allows you to get into towns that you are banned from, so I thought that'd be worthwhile. And, finally, Lore allows you to understand every other language that is spoken IG. Else, you'd have to spend 6+ Real Life months learning the language, but with high lore you roll Vs DC 46 or so to understand it.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Beware that on Arelith you will have to take the 3 first levels as rogue if you start with rogue, before you can choose your second class.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
