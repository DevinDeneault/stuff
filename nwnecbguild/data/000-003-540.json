      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I'd possibly go for FTR 6/Wiz 16/Spellsword 18 (FTR 4/Wiz 6/Spellsword 10 preepic) which gets us 4 bonus feats from FTR, 3 from Wiz and 4 from Spellsword, gives us a caster lvl of 25 and a BAB of 27, 60% ignore ASF which is good for full plate+large shield and channel spell 6 (with multiple channel 1). A Zakya Rakshasa or an Illithid would be good race choices. Since race is a primary factor with the PRC you should specify what is available.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
