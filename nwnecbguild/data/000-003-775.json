      "content": "<div>Here was a fun build idea I had.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk / DD<br/>\nAdd UMD<br/>\n<br/>\nITWF Dual Kama of course<br/>\nDelightful DD HP (650+HP) and Damage Reduction 27/-<br/>\n<br/>\nWent strength to get as much damage as possible. Dex would have meant more AB. AC and reflex saves as well, wasn't sure if it was totally needed though<br/>\n<br/>\nBase AB 40 hits the benchmark for a warrior but with dual kamas and potentially flurry (which with haste will grant the fabled 10 attacks / round) that AB is gonna take a bit of a hit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wasn't prepared to dump int any further the build benefits from skill points.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway with UMD abilities that AB can be boosted to quite nice levels in the right environment so killing and hitting things I don't anticipate to be too much of an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nGot improved evasion for the build (from level 21), improved knockdown (from level 6), monk speed +30% which with the right spells (ie mass haste)/items (ie boots of traveling/boots of speed) can make one run faster than a DM<br/>\n<br/>\nGot some trap setting skills as well (set trap 15 at level 10) hehe I dont think he needs it .\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nOne could get some detection skills instead of trapping, or put points into concentration to be taunt resistant<br/>\n<br/>\nWent assassin to dodge multiclass penalties but rogue would give more skill points, if one wishes to dodge multiclass penalties with rogue one might lose some BAB. 3d6 death attack with 8-10 attacks per round is pretty sweet with improved knockdown available. Occasionally your opponents might roll a 1 eventually (you know, 5% chance), meaning a 5 turn paralysis which is also pretty nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdd some poison to your kamas too not sure how effective that would be. Stuff like flame weapon or darkfire is obviously delightful<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finallly - no dev crit! to keep your party members happy.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThey want some of the glory so let em get at least a kill or two you know... while you tank with DR 27 650hp improved evasion / do 10 attacks per round with base AB 40 / disable em with improved knockdown / set some deadly traps -&gt; you can give em something to do to make em feel useful, teamwork and all you know<br/>\n<br/>\nBit of a beast but I like the look of this one. I've put it in the unfinished section because I haven't play tested it, also not sure if its been done before<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Monk(9), Assassin(5), Dwarven Defender(26), Dwarf\nSTR: 16 (28)\nCON: 18 (21)\nINT: 12\n\n01: Monk(1): Dodge, {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}\n03: Monk(3): Toughness\n05: Monk(5)\n07: Monk(7)\n09: Assassin(1): Two-Weapon Fighting\n11: Dwarven Defender(1): {Defensive Stance}\n13: Dwarven Defender(3)\n15: Dwarven Defender(5): Improved Two-Weapon Fighting\n17: Dwarven Defender(7)\n19: Dwarven Defender(9)\n21: Monk(9): Epic Weapon Focus: Kama, {Improved Evasion}\n23: Dwarven Defender(11)\n25: Dwarven Defender(13)\n27: Dwarven Defender(15): Great Strength I, (STR=21)\n29: Dwarven Defender(17)\n31: Dwarven Defender(19)\n33: Dwarven Defender(20): Great Strength III, (STR=24)\n35: Dwarven Defender(22): Epic Damage Reduction II\n37: Assassin(5)\n39: Dwarven Defender(25): Great Strength V, (STR=27)\n\nSkillpoints: 163\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +2, Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +2, Poison: +4\nAB (max, naked): 40 (melee), 30 (ranged)\nSpell Casting:\u00a0\n\n\n01: Discipline(1), Hide(4), Move Silently(4), Save(11),\u00a0\n03: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(12),\u00a0\n05: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(18),\u00a0\n07: Hide(1), Tumble(5), Save(21),\u00a0\n09: Disable Trap(1), Open Lock(4), Search(4), Set Trap(10), UMD(12),\u00a0\n11: Discipline(2), Save(1),\u00a0\n13: Discipline(3), Save(3),\u00a0\n15: Save(6),\u00a0\n17: Save(12),\u00a0\n19: Save(18),\u00a0\n21: Tumble(10), Save(16),\u00a0\n23: Discipline(3),\u00a0\n25: Discipline(1), Save(3),\u00a0\n27: Discipline(1), Save(7),\u00a0\n29: Discipline(1), Save(11),\u00a0\n31: Discipline(1), Save(15),\u00a0\n33: Discipline(3),\u00a0\n35: Discipline(3),\u00a0\n37: Tumble(5),\u00a0\n39: Discipline(3),\u00a0</details></div>"
