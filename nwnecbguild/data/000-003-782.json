      "timestamp": "4:01 PM - Oct 31, 2019",
      "content": "<div>Thanks for the suggestions, everyone.\u00a0 I realize I hung up my cleats years ago, but I still play from time to time and I still build a bit, but it\u2019s mostly off the record kind of stuff.\u00a0 This has been my first attempt at a formalized build since my Ruinous Devastation.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n@Orion: Regarding taking Weapon Focus earlier \u2013 a few others mentioned this as well, and that\u2019s sound advice.\u00a0 However, I did have a reason for taking it later.\u00a0 In fact, I was actually considering pushing it back even further (around 9<sup>th</sup>) and I\u2019ll explain why.\u00a0 I hate to be married to a particular weapon early on.\u00a0 I tend to let the rhythm of the environment dictate what I\u2019ll choose.\u00a0 On Greyhawk, some of the best weapons in game are ones that are dynamically created in a rare random drop.\u00a0 I\u2019ve always hated taking weapon focus in something early on only to find an amazing \u201cx weapon\u201d that could have carried me into Epics.\u00a0 Often times such weapons don\u2019t even bear an Enhancement value, but Rangers can compensate with their versatile Blade Thirst.\u00a0 But yes, if I were married to a weapon early on, I would take Weapon Focus at Level 3 and not Level 6<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nRegarding Epic Will vs Anything Else \u2013 yes, in my original Half-Orc version (before settling on Human), I had Epic Skill Focus: Craft Trap.\u00a0 The DC for Epic traps is 55 (iirc).\u00a0 I then waffled on whether this really had long term value since I wouldn\u2019t achieve it until the twilight of the character\u2019s career.\u00a0 Of course, one could argue that there is diminishing returns for Epic Will at Level 39, or any feat for that matter, but something must be chosen.\u00a0 I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s much value other than an Epic Save feat, or an Epic Skill Focus, at Level 39.\u00a0 You may talk me into going the Epic Skill Focus route, though that will require me to put more points into Craft Trap in order to get close to that 55 DC.\u00a0 <br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nTo facilitate such, I most likely would drop Con to 12 and bump Int to 12, but I do like having the raw 500 hp Ranger.\u00a0 He is low on defense, so he has to make up for it somewhere.\u00a0 Or, I could re-allocate my current skill point distribution.\u00a0 Looking at what I have listed, there isn\u2019t anything I would care to make lower.\u00a0 One could argue Animal Empathy, but I make good use of this pre-epic, particularly between Level 5-15 when I can lock down Dire Bears and Ancient Dire Bears.\u00a0 And while your suggestion on lowering Dex to 12 is worth consideration, bear in mind I don\u2019t plan on wearing Heavy Armor for a very long time, if ever, and on WoG AC matters, especially pre-epic.\u00a0 Surprisingly, there are ways to make up for this on the back end by way of items.\u00a0 There are ways to acquire or even craft your own items to make up for Skill score shortfalls.\u00a0 For instance, with a mediocre socket item, one could gradually make an item that added skill bonus to Craft Trap, Set Trap, and Disable Trap.\u00a0 It might take a while, but it would be a side project that your character would work on over the course of their career.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n@Webshaman:\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know that about the Badger either!\u00a0 That\u2019s good to know.\u00a0 Now I want to get in there and see what the other animals have under the hood.\u00a0 I\u2019ve always enjoyed using the Panther.\u00a0 If used properly, it\u2019s a great damage delivery system.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n@Stagmeister, see the above regarding my thoughts on the Weapon Focus feat.\u00a0 Also, regarding Cleave, I find having Cleave at Level 1 and 2 far more valuable than Weapon Focus.\u00a0 It\u2019s a quasi-extra attack, which is far more useful at low levels when you only have one.\u00a0 Unless I don\u2019t have a choice, I typically grab Cleave early on when the design calls for it, and I always regret not having it when I choose WF instead.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nAlso, regarding your suggestion for a 33 UMD, I was actually considering dropping UMD to 26.\u00a0 Anything that I want to UMD I can effectively do with a modified score of 25.\u00a0 Unless you have a compelling reason to take it higher, I\u2019ll probably reduce it and bump Craft Trap up few notches.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n@gkorjax:\u00a0 I am unable to attain IKD in this build.\u00a0 One needs a raw 13 Intelligence.\u00a0 If I could, I would, your right, but alas it is not meant to be.\u00a0 KD is enough for most medium-sized casters.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nFinally, someone mentioned taking Assassin over Rogue.\u00a0 That is a viable option if one is interested in using a Different Race \u2013 Dwarf comes to mind in that situation.\u00a0 In so doing, you would lose Evasion and about 16 skill points, and you would have to lock in on an evil alignment.\u00a0 The benefit would be the Use Poison feat, which I do like, and poison has a bit more teeth on WoG than regular environments.\u00a0 <br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nThank you, everyone.\u00a0 You certainly have given me much to consider.\u00a0 I think you all hit on those areas on which I remain undecided.\u00a0 Admittedly this is not a supreme wipe-the-floor-with-the-carcasses-of-your-enemies type of build, but it certainly has enough versatility to deal with most situations.\u00a0 I think bringing the Craft Trap score up to around 40, and swapping Epic Will with ESF: Craft Trap, are worthy.\u00a0 In so doing, I would probably take the ESF much earlier (but not at the expense of BoE or Dev Crit progression) in order to get earlier access to some of these trap creations.\u00a0 In so doing, I\u2019ll probably drop Constitution to 12 and raise Intelligence to 12.\u00a0 This will garner about 8 skill points per level, and give the player a bit more flexibility with Skill Point allocation.\u00a0 <br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nThanks again!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hi GDL thanks for considering the feedback!\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nJust with craft trap, the NWN Wiki states epic traps cannot be crafted (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Craft_trap\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Craft_trap</a>), its why I chose the modified 34 target for deadly electrical traps which do 30d6 damage to up to 7 enemies in a 15 foot radius. There are certain items that can increase craft trap skills for example gloves of the artificer, items which increase intelligence, luck stone ?amulet of the master so one could get away with a lower score I think<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough with all this I haven't done a lot of crafting of traps, although I have made a character on WoG who has a modified craft trap 33 and will start muck around with it in the next few weeks (for learning purposes)\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nbut anyway I was wondering (in fact <em>hoping\u00a0<span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83d\ude42</span></em>) you knew something I didn't<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso Valerfor has taught me UMD 30 is a good target for WoG to equip items, there are certain boots that require this located\u00a0in a mine in the desert that I like very much and would grant a bit of versatility to your build, that might be of interest to your character,. having played a few UMD using fighter type builds recently I heartily agree with Valerfor's opinion on this matter<br/>\n<br/>\nBest wishes</div>"
