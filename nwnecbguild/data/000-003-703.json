      "content": "<div>Hello all!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have thought about a bard meeler for my second PC to be played on WoG server, but it had to be a different one than the one played before (Bard26.Rdd10.Fighter4).<br/>\nWell, maybe this toon's not so different but I have never seen the same class level split both into this new ECB and the former one, as they either had cleric as main class or had each classe below lv 20: this ruins the \"undispellability\" factor (from greater dispelling), which can be a real nuisance on WoG.<br/>\nDue to the high Strenght, I chose as deity, in WoG, Kord.<br/>\n<br/>\nRevision after revision, here is the current build, waiting for your advices and - after some playtesting, if in your opinion it can deserve - a place into the \"Full lv 40\"

<br/>\n40: Concentration(2), Discipline(2), Search(1), Spellcraft(1), <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis build is quite feat starved, and I struggled to take either the \"divine\" feats (and prerequisite) and the \"minimum\" combat feats. However, due to the high STR and bardic defenses (songs/haste/improved invisibility, either war cry when fighting multiple foes with low will save that can be subject to \"fear\"), I chose to rely on a 2-hand weapon, and such weapon can only be a spear to avoid taking proficiency feats.<br/>\nLasting inspirations allows for an higher use of debuffing song (ucurse song), as the uses needed to buff my pc are lower.<br/>\nCHA is raised to 18, so by capping it (30) one can reach a \"round\" 10 divine damage/AC (in game calculations are easier with rounded numbers <span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83d\ude1c</span>).<br/>\nAlso, divine power and shield awork with CHA, so there is a synergy between cleric and bard classes. This is my preferred combination, as I can play good characters (instead, the other choice would be to switch to Blackguard, but that means one more feat as prerequisite and more room for levels, making it impossible for bard to reach undispellability - apart from Mords - and the RDD to obtain the bonus feat. Also, I find it really hard of playing evil characters).<br/>\nIf it is needed, one can choose to go \"morningstar + shield\" for more AC.<br/>\nFor meta-magic feats, as I would play it in WoG server the choice would be to replace still spell with craft wand.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnbuffed AB is 42 that can be raised by 5 (greater magic weapon), 2 (war cry), 6 (bulls strenght+items), 7 (bard+curse song) = 62<br/>\nEven without capped STR, at lv 40 AB can be raised for a long time to 42+5+7+2(maximum bulls strenght effect)= 56<br/>\nDamage at lv 40 is 1d8+31 (with spear and capped STR) or 1d8+25 (morningstar), plus the temporary \"war cry\" effect (+2 damage) (hope that I have not lost something).<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Builds with the same classes in the new ECB guild</span>:<br/>\nUniversal Draco Priest by Empyre65 (bard 4 / cleric 26 / red dragon disciple 10, human)<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Builds with the same classes in the old ECB guild</span>:<br/>\n(CLC 16/Bard 14/RDD 10): cleric 16 / bard 14 / red dragon disciple 10 (human?) by cdualepp<br/>\nScion of the Wyrm: bard 15 / cleric 15 / red dragon disciple 10 (human) by Cinnabar Din<br/>\nAngelic Avenger: cleric 14 / bard 16 / red dragon disciple 10 (human?) by Diesel, Vin Diesel<br/>\nWarPriest of the Dragonlords: cleric 22 / bard 8 / red dragon disciple 10 (human) by dmuzzy<br/>\nDivine Spellsword: cleric 28 / bard 2 / red dragon disciple 10 (human) by dust7<br/>\nDivine Dragon Herald: bard 16 / cleric 14 / red dragon disciple 10 (elf?) by Ithacan<br/>\nHoly Dragon Song: cleric 19 / bard 11 / red dragon disciple 10 (human?) by Ithacan<br/>\nDraconic Cleric: cleric 26 / bard 4 / red dragon disciple 10 (human) by Jennalee<br/>\ndraconic divine cleric: cleric 24 / bard 2 / red dragon disciple 14 (human?) by jjjhhhlll<br/>\nBlood And Faith: bard 4 / cleric 26 / red dragon disciple 10 (human) by Mithdradates<br/>\n<br/>\nEnough words from my side, let's hear yours! <span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83d\ude0b</span><br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: build taken to lv 4.

      "content": "<div>Okay I closed the web page before finishing the reply, and lost all I wrote. I'll try to be concise this time. But thank you for your observations, I really appreciate them!<br/>\n<br/>\n@ Mick and Orion: I agree with you, the cleric levels are to be taken as early as possible, and I like the feat and level progression suggested by Orion! However, it seems that if I even want to level up for two levels as a cleric, I have to adhere to the server rules and take one of the available deities. Between Animal and Healing domains, Animal wins as it can truly help me levelling.<br/>\nI will post a clarification request on WoG forums, so I can understand if rules for divine classes apply also to 1 cleric level. <br/>\n<br/>\n@ rattyuk and Orion (remaining comments): I have already played with a bard26.fighter4.RDD10 in the WoG offline module, so I would want to avoid playing the same type of build so early (who knows what the future will bring). Moreover, creating something that has not been done before has truly encouraged me (as usually I am not so creative).<br/>\nI understand that, even if without Weapon specialisation, the damage alone from strenght is sufficient. <br/>\nFor dev crit, I want to avoid it for both personal and pratical reasons: personal is that I truly dislike that feat, as it makes things boring (already tried it with a max scimitar crit range) and I don't want to transform such an exciting experience as WoG in a boring experience. Maybe one day I'll change my idea, but not now..... :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand your point of view for divine feats, and I chose divine feats for more AC (even if, with the bard.fighter.RDD I managed to reach &gt;74 AC), thinking that in a fight I would choose among one of them, and not both of them.<br/>\nAs I am RDD and bard, I would agree to replace Divine Shield with either Expertise/toughness/cleave (improved knockdown is not that useful, as at highest levels I could knockdown (with the Bard.Fi.RDD) also elite fire giants and drow weapon masters and priestess): I am tempted to avoid taking expertise in favour of cleave, or toughness as with it and a +4 CON item this build would reach 500 HP. <br/>\nCraft wand, instead of still spell, will help a lot, so I will be uncertain til the last minute on which metamagic feat to consider.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn earlier level of bard also helps a lot taking an earlier lasting inspiration --&gt; if the bard song lasts more, there will be more uses of curse song, which means obtainging +7 AC/AB boost more times. Also, having CHA items helps singing a lv17 song, which means also +6 to skills that can allow her to open lock/search easily.<br/>\nBlackguard would help a lot, but I am not so tempted by Evil itself (well, maybe in the future <span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83d\ude2c</span>), even if I can understand the (many) benefits of taking 4 levels (bard26.BG4.RDD10).<br/>\n<br/>\nHere you can find the updated build. I will need to playtest it, now I am really busy with work so things will get a bit slow.<br/>\nOrion, I will send you a PM for team session, I think I need to relevel it from scratch before having some team up adventures ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nFor cleric rules on WoG, I will post a clarification request so I can understand if rules for divine classes apply also to 1 cleric level. <br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Bard(25), Red Dragon Disciple(14), Cleric(1), Human\nSTR: 16 (40)\nCON: 14 (16)\nINT: 14 (16)\n\n01: Bard(1): Curse Song, Power Attack\n03: Cleric(1): Divine Might, Domain Healing, Domain Animal\n05: Bard(4)\n07: Bard(6)\n09: Bard(8): Knockdown\n11: Bard(10)\n13: Bard(12)\n15: Bard(14): Still Spell\n17: Bard(16)\n19: Red Dragon Disciple(2): (STR=22)\n21: Bard(17): Epic Weapon Focus: Spear\n23: Bard(19)\n25: Bard(21)\n27: Bard(23): Great Strength II, Lasting Inspiration, (STR=26)\n29: Red Dragon Disciple(4): (STR=29)\n31: Red Dragon Disciple(6)\n33: Red Dragon Disciple(8): Great Strength IV, (STR=32)\n35: Red Dragon Disciple(10): {Darkvision}, (STR=36), (CHA=17)\n37: Red Dragon Disciple(12)\n39: Red Dragon Disciple(14): Great Strength VI, Armor Skin, (STR=39)\n\nSkillpoints: 277\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9\nAB (max, naked): 42 (melee), 23 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Bard(6)\n\n\n01: Concentration(1), Discipline(4), Listen(4), Lore(1), Open Lock(1), Perform(4), Spellcraft(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), \n03: Save(5), \n05: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Lore(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), \n07: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Lore(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), \n09: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), \n11: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), \n13: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), \n15: Concentration(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(4), \n17: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(3), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(3), UMD(1), Save(4), \n19: Concentration(2), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Search(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(4), \n21: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(4), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(2), Save(1), \n23: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(2), UMD(1), \n25: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), \n27: Concentration(2), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), \n29: Concentration(2), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(1), \n31: Concentration(2), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(1), \n33: Concentration(2), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(1), \n35: Concentration(2), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(1), \n37: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(5), \n39: Concentration(1), Discipline(2), Listen(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(9), \n</details></div>"
