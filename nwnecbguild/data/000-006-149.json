      "content": "<div>So I was nosing around the World Of Greyhawk build boards and ran across a build someone had done of a high level wizard and they had a bit to learn about toon building, to put it politely... \u00a0While reading through the comments I ran across this Gem from a ECB old-timer.<br/>\n<br/>\nKail Pendragon: \u00a0\"You can have a much better magic crafter, full offensive/defensive caster, party support, stealth expert build, epic trapper by simply going Wiz 35/Rogue 4/SD 1 caster build with <strong>triple epic spell focus, high int (and dex left at 14 starting), all magic crafting feats, the key metamagic ones, better skill selection</strong>. Also, race can be changed to human or halfling easily as elf would do little good.\" (bolding mine)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat caught my eye was the bolded part. \u00a0So of course I had to try and make just such a unicorn...<br/>\n<br/>\nI did manage to get two foci with all the other things mentioned, but sadly had to stay human. \u00a0By losing toughness and one of the meta magic feats I could get a third foci, but would need to free an epic feat to get the third epic foci fully spec'ed. \u00a0I could go halfling with only losing toughness, but I was curious about your take on the same type of build...<br/>\n<br/>\nI also thought about dropping the auto still feats for an armor skin (or epic spell foci if going third school) and 2 more great Ints, but wanted to leave myself open to use any real sweet roguish armor or shield that came along. \u00a0And talk about skill point overload... I still had 30 I hadn't allocated.<br/>\n<br/>\nBelow is a quick throw-together that could probably be optimized, but looks playable as is. \u00a0And if Hip ever gets back.. even has a skills table (though I'm sure they need optimized. \u00a0On the PW I play on, I often let several levels worth of skill build up then apply them all at once).<br/>\n<br/>\n------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\nWizard(35), Rogue(4), Shadowdancer(1), Human<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 12<br/>\nDEX: 14<br/>\nCON: 12<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT:

      "content": "<div>Hello conlaoch!<br/>\n<br/>\nI like this build. Solid caster level, has a very high number of skill points and you make the most of it by minor classing with Rogue and adding HiPS to take full advantage of stealth skills. Great stuff!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I'm terrible at arcane spell casters but even I can appreciate this build and not only that I will make some suggestions to see if we can make your build even more optimised than before even if I truly lack the experience of playing an arcane spell caster properly! feel free to accept or discard as you please!<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Starting stats: If you choose Human as a race, put Str to 10 and Cons to 14 to get the HP close to 300, so you can survive a couple of IGMS's. Halfling its reasonable to avoid Str penalties for carrying purposes, and take the extra stats from Dex into Cons anyway.\nRogue level for skill dumps: Suggest spreading them a bit more if you can. I think you could safely ignore AB and not worry about the pre-epic level split. Even if you had a BAB of 19 your spells and traps are going to be killing em :) Maybe 8, 18, 28, 40 or something and SD at level 9 to access HiPS as soon as you take your first skill dump into stealth, also because of UMD (see below)\nRogue level 1 for maximal skill points: I don't recommend this but if you want to go nuts you can do this for +(8-2)x4 = +24 skill points for maximum late game power but as you said you have enough skill points\nUMD: Suggest getting higher amounts earlier than you do. UMD 1 (modified) at level 35 is gonna hurt. Suggest Rogue 1 at level 8 to access UMD 10 modified. That way you can use those cool +3 AC monk boots and robes etc etc\nAuto-Still Spell: Do you need this feat? Due to only having light armor proficiency and no shield proficiency, at most you will be wearing light armor, and will be unable to use a shield. Is silent spell better than Still? I would swap the three Auto-Still spell feats for Great Intelligences, or Epic Skill Focus: Hide / Move Silently and something else, could be another skill focus if you like or spell foci etc...\nCraft Trap: I have limited experience with this, but the NWN wiki seems to state a Deadly Electrical Trap can be crafted with no chance of failure with a modified crafting score of 34. These traps do 30d6 electrical to up to 7 enemies in a 15 ft radius, and wizards have this has a class skill. worth thinking about whether you want to invest into this.\nListen/Spot: how much you put into this skill depends on whether True Seeing is strong in your environment or not. If it's the vanilla spell then I think these skills you can put minimal or no investment in it?\nDisable Trap / Open Lock: also depends on how the Knock and Find Trap spells work in your environment. If they are vanilla, then disable trap is eventually only going to be good for retrieving traps (which you could craft if you have the skill). Open Lock will only be good for quest doors which are pickable, but are not breakable, and the knock spell won't work on them. PM me if this is confusing but I have encountered this multiple times.\u00a0\nSchool specialisation: Worth considering for +1 spell / day each slot? Or stay general. Not sure what the right answer is here! Maybe stay general? Nothing beats being able to cast every spell in the game :) I think you have enough spells / day but doesn't hurt to check\n</details></div>"

      "content": "<div>Thanks Valefor and Orion.. \u00a0some good advice there. \u00a0<br/>\nI especially liked the moving up of the auto still and the re-ordering of the rogue levels. \u00a0<br/>\nDoes this gal really need auto still? \u00a0 probably not, but this does give her the ability to use some of the nice light amor on WoG at the cost of +1 spell DC<br/>\nCraft trap.. thats what I forgot.... \u00a0and i still have the points left to take it.. just need to re-order the skill table to fit it in.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did try and re-order the stats a bit, but dodge requires 13+ dex, and I couldn't find a combination I liked that didn't leave an odd stat hanging in the wind. \u00a0Halfling might be better for the stats due to the dex bump though.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn WoG, traps are easy to come by and a real favorite of mine for leveling. \u00a0There's one underground area that has some fire giants and an ogre or two (Undermountain) \u00a0and 60-70 minor acid splash traps will take a level 2 toon to level 8. \u00a0Assuming she's real careful and doesn't mind the inherent risk. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if only I could find a sequencer 3 item there.....</div>"

I could play normally, but Kail kinda spoiled that for me. \u00a0He once challenged me to take a lvl 5 wizard to Critwall and level there. \u00a0So I did. \u00a0and 1 kill netted me 10 levels and 3 dirtnap freight trains back to the respawn point. \u00a0And I've been hooked on pushing the limits ever since...\u00a0</div>"
