The Scimitar extended crit range will increase the chances to land a critical smite especially with a keen weapon. Minimum dmg output on a critical smite becomes 700 (see below for the scythe stats) which IMHO is more than enough. Given the limited amount of smites per day in this case I'm of the idea that Scimitar would actually serve the build better than Scythe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>******************************</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>AB STATS</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nAB (mundane Scythe): 37<br/>\nAB (self buffed): 58 (DF, Bless, Aid, BS, prayer, HS, DW)<br/>\nAB (max): 63 (capped STR)<br/>\n<br/>\nSmite Evil: +8/+14 capped CHA<br/>\n<br/>\nMax AB: 77 capped AB, STR, CHA on a smite<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>******************************</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>DAMAGE OUTPUT ON A SMITE</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n2-8 base scythe damage output<br/>\n+3 STR mod times 1.5<br/>\n+9 capped STR<br/>\n+5 GMW/Holy Sword or +5 scythe<br/>\n+5 Divine Favour<br/>\n+3 Deafening Clang<br/>\n+1 Prayer<br/>\n+7 Divine Wrath<br/>\n+1-6 Holy Sword vs evil<br/>\n+8-14 Divine Might<br/>\n+198 Great Smite V (33 paladin+CoT lvl times 6)<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\n242-259 on a smite<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\n1210-1295 on a critical smite<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>******************************</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFeedback and constructive criticism is, as usual, gladly appreciated.</div>"

That meant getting EWF, EP, IC and Extra smiting in addition to WM 7 (extra crit range)to augment the theme related abilities which is to deliver a powerful and hopefully critical smite. Since CoT can be dropped to 18, once one goes WM 7, Paladin can be increased to 15 at basically no cost. The great smiting feats loss cost is hence minimized to GS-V vs GS-X against the net increase in AB (+3), crit range (17-20 vs 20) and smites a day (3x/day vs 1x/day), not to mention the extra spells and capped spell effects and divine shield which increase both the attack potential (and hence damage output) and the defenses of the build. Consider the original is a one trick pony: this takes that concept and turns it into a playable build.<br/>\n<br/>\nLosing a further GS in favor of more spells seems to betray the build's concept. The extra spells here were acquired basically free of charge once the WM 7 route had been chosen, in your suggestion they would detract from the build's focus. Mind me, the suggestion is good, but this is no generic build. And it belongs together with going for scimitar vs scythe or AS vs GS-V, as options available if one wants to further walk away from the damage adept. I mean, when making suggestions for this build, keep present the original Damage Adept as your reference point and do not start from this build alone or you'll lose perspective. That said, I guess I'll have to post the Paladin 23/CoT 10 version I have too, as a stand alone build (you know what they say Max, great minds think alike so I was there too on my own)</div>"

This is a Damage Adept made playable, no point going Paladin/CoT/FTR or Paladin/CoT/Rogue. Both have been done and both me and Grim posted Paladin/CoT/FTR GS-X smiters back at the old ECB: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build245366.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GrimSmiter: Paladin 26/CoT 10/FTR 4</a> and me somewhere in some build suggestion thread.
