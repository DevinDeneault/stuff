This is a little one, and she suffers knockdown penalties from size, and (if not unarmed) her OP kama of megadeath might get disarmed pretty quickly.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally in losing battles, with that monk speed this little one can power away, stealth, set up a few traps for some mischief, detect em before they detect her, and try again.<br/>\n<br/>\nHP is around 350 which is pretty sweet. Fit epic dodge in there as well.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n370 skill points, dual detection so she can see things like a hawk from miles away, also some craft trap too to make a few deadly traps, albeit one might want to buff that with items or drinking fox's cunning potions aiming for craft trap 25 modified with buffs for a 50/50 success rate crafting deadly traps<br/>\n<br/>\nWill save base 18 is a weakness here, but funnily enough the build does get +2 to saves against mind effects and +2 to saves against fear which is a bit of a buffer. Additionally one can add protection against evil scrolls, clarity potions/UMD for lesser mind blank or mind blank, teammates or mind immunity items to cover the gap here<br/>\n<br/>\nFortitude 25 is also not the highest, but there are enough skills in this little one's box to kite dev critting enemies to death (with the exception of a dev critting monk) and run away from implosion bombs / wail of the banshee.<br/>\n<br/>\nBigbys are going to be a killer though so always check out if there are sneaky mages sitting in the background before you engage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hillgrass tornado (rogue 29/fighter 6/monk 5) by avariedo uses halfling and a similar class combo and amount. It is a more a melee focused build with ITWF kama / SC V.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThought I'd share this one, see what your thoughts are, this looks like a fun build to play solo or party.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Edit 16/1/20:</strong>\u00a0<br/>\nFleshed out this idea a lot more. Added a picture. Renamed the build to\u00a0Yondalla's Fleet-Footed Sharp-Shooter. Changed gender to female (although one can play a male version). Reordered the feats to get rapid shot faster (it has the AB to use it at level 2!), WS/EWS faster. Crippling Strike at lvl 19, delayed epic dodge to lvl 30 (this lass is aiming not to get hit in the first place).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAdjusted the skills. Deadly traps can be set at level 13. Epic Traps can be set at level 29 with +3 to set trap (from additional +6 dex from items/potions/spells, +set trap items, or One with the Land scrolls), but eventually no items or buffs will be required to set epic traps. Spot prioritised over listen but listen eventually is maxed. This one looks pretty strong to me and I'll start play testing this one soon.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Rogue(28), Fighter(6), Monk(6), Halfling\nSTR: 10\nCON: 12\nINT: 14\n\n01: Rogue(1): Point Blank Shot\n03: Rogue(2): Weapon Focus: Shortbow, {Evasion}\n05: Fighter(2): Weapon Finesse\n07: Monk(2): {Deflect Arrows}\n09: Rogue(4): Blind Fight\n11: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Shortbow\n13: Rogue(6)\n15: Rogue(8): Toughness\n17: Monk(4)\n19: Rogue(10): Crippling Strike\n21: Monk(5): Epic Weapon Focus: Shortbow\n23: Rogue(12)\n25: Rogue(13): Improved Evasion\n27: Rogue(15): Improved Sneak Attack I\n29: Rogue(17)\n31: Rogue(19): Epic Dodge\n33: Rogue(21): Improved Sneak Attack III\n35: Rogue(23)\n37: Rogue(25)\n39: Rogue(27): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=31)\n\nSkillpoints: 370\nSaving Throw bonuses: Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +5, Fear: +2\nAB (max, naked): 39 (melee), 42 (ranged)\nSpell Casting:\u00a0\n\n\n01: Craft Trap(3), Disable Trap(4), Hide(4), Listen(4), Move Silently(4), Open Lock(1), Search(4), Set Trap(4), Spot(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4),\u00a0\n03: Disable Trap(1), Hide(2), Listen(2), Move Silently(2), Set Trap(1), Spot(2), Tumble(2), UMD(2),\u00a0\n05: Craft Trap(1), Save(3),\u00a0\n07: Craft Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(1), Save(2),\u00a0\n09: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(3), Spot(5), UMD(5),\u00a0\n11: Save(7),\u00a0\n13: Craft Trap(3), Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(2), Spot(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n15: Craft Trap(1), Disable Trap(5), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n17: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n19: Disable Trap(3), Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Search(1), Spot(3), UMD(3),\u00a0\n21: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n23: Disable Trap(3), Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Spot(3), Tumble(5), UMD(3),\u00a0\n25: Disable Trap(2), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(6), Spot(2), UMD(2),\u00a0\n27: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(5), UMD(1),\u00a0\n29: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(5), Spot(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n31: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(2), Move Silently(1), Search(3), Spot(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n33: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Search(5), Spot(1),\u00a0\n35: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(6), Move Silently(1), Spot(1),\u00a0\n37: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n39: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(6), Move Silently(1), Spot(1),\u00a0</details>\n<strong>Update 17/1/2020:\u00a0</strong><br/>\nJust did a brief party run with Aquarius 233 and Franz. Up to level 4. Its pretty strong. Rapid shot for 2 APR, great AB with all the dex and small stature, hitting 8-10AB with 2d6 sneak attack. Spot is extremely valuable to detect things from a distance and target enemies. I have to make sure the outline of the enemy is fully defined before I start shooting, without blind fight I suffer -4AB. Rogue is great for all the skills as well like disable trap etc.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
