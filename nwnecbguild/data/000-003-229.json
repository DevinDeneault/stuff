      "content": "<div>Hello All,<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm just looking for a few prods in the right direction for this build, please. When you see my parameters you'll see why it's a build for me to make, rather than you perfectionists, but it all helps in my development, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n To the bones. I'm looking to build a full L40 PvM creation that is human, male and melee-centric. They are predominantly Barbarian, as rage (or more particularly terrifying rage is key. So far so good. Things start to get a little less optimum around now. He will not be a heavy armour wearer - I can stretch to medium, but light is preferred - and he doesn't do shields (great for AC, I know). He's not even that fond of two-handed weapons or dual-wield, but I think I can get around that - though not without problems, for while his weapon of choice is probably bastard sword (I have some flexibility there, thank goodness), he does carry plenty of knives. Oh, and he's STR and DEX focused, with as much CON as I can squeeze in - fortunately, he's not a spell-chucker.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, at the moment I'm thinking a Barbarian/Ranger split of about 31/9, but I'm aware that i) best guidance tends to be that if 2 classes makes it better, 3 makes it more so, and ii) I believe Tumble would be a good skill for him. This all inclines me to chuck some Rogue, or possibly Bard at him. And now I get confused: is it better for me to drop Ranger (which would only be there for Dual-wield/Imp 2 weapon fighting, given the armour impositions), and load more Rogue/Bard; or would the cost of Ambidexterity and 2 weapon fighting be too high?<br/>\n<br/>\n I've got myself into a bit of a tizzy over this, so I thought I'd ask for advice. Hope you don't mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks in advance - and sorry (bloody role-players, eh!)</div>",

      "content": "<div>I am by no means a power builder, but in my mind, I see your toon as a Dex-based Ranger 21/Barbarian 15/Harper Scout 4<br/>\n<br/>\n Ranger not only gives you the dual wield feats, but also 2d6+5 extra damage against 5 races. Barb, of course, gives your Terrifying Rage and Harper gives you tumble. You get stackable Cat's Grace from Ranger and Harper, as well. Iron Will + Tymora's Smile give you some mind resistance.<br/>\n<br/>\n Bastard Sword is out for a dexer, however, but Rapier and Dagger (or Kukri) could be wicked against favored enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\n You could do that combo STR based with a Bastard Sword, but with light armor and no shield . . . even with full tumble you;ll be moderately easy pickings.\u00a0</div>"

So playing, not building. Apologies.<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, thought I'd log back in to check I'm patching, modding appropriately for that campaign, and then thought I'd see what else was going on - and blimey, you've all been very helpful!

Thank you. Just a couple of questions. While I've got movement from the person who's looking for this character in many areas (such as dropping Barbarian, wearing decent armour and shield early on, etc), he's not budging on the build being human, and really wants a bastard sword - tho' I have explained the benefits of the much-underrated scimitar. So, would a BS-wielding human version wreck the build, or would it just take a couple of tweaks?<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks in advance.

I'd started having a look at what might happen with STR 16, DEX 17, CON 11, and INT 12 - primarily because I'm not that fussed about points in Open Lock, Disable and Set Trap (saving me 35 skill points), and I could live without a full deck of Spot. I had thought about pumping CON by 1, but that - together with the +1 needed in DEX, I'd just come around to thinking was too much of a penalty elsewhere (AB, for example). So I'd begun scratching the old head and thought I'd have a look here to see if anyone had replied - and guess what - you've come to the same conclusion as me! At least this means I'm learning!<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Valerfor - any enlightenment, please?</div>",

Anyway, if you choose to do so, the benefits are as Empyre says with the addition of 43 skill points that you could use for stealth and so on, OR you could just take a longsword instead of a bastard-sword and change nothing at all from the build.<br/>\n<br/>\n Glad you enjoying \"Shadow Avenger\" ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n ~ You point - I punch!</div>"
