      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The original concept for this build came up as a conversation with Bulvine while playing on WoG.  We were tossing ideas back and forth about RDD stereotypes and came up with this monster.  I looked through the build engine and found <strong>1</strong> Fighter / Bard / RDD build that had both Dev Crit an EDR, Spooky222's <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build117531.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dragon Warrior (FTR 28/Bard 2/RDD 10)</a>.  Most builds go for either more bard for casting or lots of raw strength.  There were a few dual wielders and a couple of more \"defensive\" minded builds (defensive being a relative term - we are talking about FTR/RDD's here).<br/>\n<br/>\nCompared to Spooky's build, the Dreadnought has 4 more bard levels to spread out the skill dumps, a much different leveling scheme and differences in feat selection.  Also, with Spooky's setup, you can't use bard song until level 18 @ Bard 2 whereas you can here at level 7 with Bard 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake a look.

You can go Human instead.  You will gain 43 skill points and another feat but lose out on 1 AB because you now have to trade 2 STR bumps for CON.<br/>\n2.  Expertise is not critical to this build since base armor+shield is 36, but I like my AC and his AB is high enough where you probably won't notice a difference.  On the human version, Improved Expertise is an option to further increase AC.<br/>\n3.  This build does not get any spells and I am not making any apologies for that.  This is an out-and-out front liner  Besides, with only 6 levels of Bard, and with level 6 coming at 40, the use of spells would not add much, if anything to this build.<br/>\n<br/>\nPros:<br/>\n1.  Strong offensive presence:  Dev Crit with a 44 DC, 45 AB, STR of 38 = 14 extra points of damage, EWS = 6 extra points of damage, Taunt<br/>\n2.  Strong defensive presence:  36 AC for a plate wielder and 41 with Expertise, 600 HP, RDD immunities, EDR for 9 points<br/>\n<br/>\nCons:<br/>\n1.  Lack of skills (if built as-is)<br/>\n2.  Relatively weak saves.  With no Evasion and a Reflex of only 21, expect to take full damage from most traps.  +10 vs. Spells can be a life saver here and you get +1 to all saves with bard song activated at level 40)<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing the Krit's search engine, I found 22 Fighter / Bard / RDD builds.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuild with EDR and Dev Crit:<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build117531.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dragon Warrior (FTR 28/Bard 2/RDD 10) by Spooky222</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBuilds with EDR:<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build218653.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Munchkin the Dwarf Dragon Wannabe by Xylophone (Fighter 28/Bard 2/RDD 10)</a> - EDR comes late in the build<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build214152.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Dualist (FTR 24/Bard 8/RDD 8) by Cinnabar Din</a> - dual wielder with 2 different weapon types<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build202966.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Master of Resistance (FTR 22/Bard 8/RDD 10) by Cinnabar Din</a> - unique energy resistance build<br/>\n<br/>\nOther Fighter-heavy builds:<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build212801.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Great Wyrm (Bard 10/RDD 10/ Fighter 20) by aquamoeba</a> - high strength build (STR=42), dev crit @ lev 21<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build220967.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Versatile Draconic Warrior (Fighter 22/ Bard 8/ RDD 10) by Jennalee</a> - no dev crit<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I think he just wanted more playability and skill dumps and earlier stuff. Worthy effort, although not at all my style of building. I generally sacrifice playability for more lvl 40 power, not making them unplayable, but relying on my in-game decision-making to get them by, and this guy goes the opposite way. I'd go for the 28/2/10 spread or Bard 26 FTR 4 RDD 10 or Bard 16 FTR 14 RDD 10, or Bard 20 FTR 10 RDD 10.

I typically look for playability over pure level 40 power so he's right on that account also.  <br/>\n<br/>\nA 6th level bard can cast up to level 2 spells, so if you wanted to have that option, increase starting CHA to 10 (and get to 12 through the RDD) by dropping STR to 14.  The end result is a STR of 36 and AB of 44 and you start casting at level 23 @ Bard 4.  Since Bard isn't picked at level 1, you can start with any value of CHA.  However, the the timing of when you get access to spells, their short duration and having to do the strip show each time really limits their usefulness.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The spells are semi useful against pure fighter types who can't dispel you, but generally against anything who can the spells last 1 round. The Bard Song is more useful. <br/>\nI think dropping some Bard levels would be better though. The gains from Bard 6 compared to Bard 2 in Bard Song are just 1 Reflex and Fort saves and an extra dam. Dropping 2 Bard pre epic gets an extra fighter level and you can take Luck of Heroes and regain the saves plus an extra will save. Dropping 2 in epic gets 2 great strengths and the extra dam plus an extra AB.
