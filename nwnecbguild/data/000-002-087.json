I don't think I could make something on the level of Max's or Mick daggers but I'm happy to share what I know. The focus on the guide will be more on styles of shifter builds, how they are played, what environment to play which shifter build in and the various quirks and oddities of merging. We already have excellent resources for what shifter forms do and how they do it, im more interested in the application of said tools.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been playing NWN off and on for 15 years and the majority of my characters have been shifters of various types. I recently have been enjoying swordflight and I am a rabid fan of WoG alongside many others. I have successfully finished Aielund saga, OC, OC extension modules, Blackguard, and many others all with shifters. I even did some extensive pvp with them on a few arena servers for a few months. I currently have 1 level 40 Shifter/druid/monk, 1 level 35 shifter/druid/barbarian, and a low 20's shifter/druid/assasin on world of greyhawk that I have leveled with a combination of soloing and duoing. Plus a few characters lost to time on the 1.69 version of the server.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm making this post as a general introduction and invitation to anyone with questions or insight into the shifter class or its various builds to join in.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce the full guide is typed I will be submitting it for approval and critique in the appropriate forum.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I do tend to devote a lot of effort into writing them and sometimes they take a LONG time. The Arcane Caster guide took over 6 months of on-and-off writing and I still learned more stuff afterwards that I wish it contained.<br/>\n<br/>\nA guide to Shifters would be an AMAZING addition to the guild, especially coming from one as experienced as yourself. I have built ONE shifter and played him to level 25 on Old WoG, but he's a Druid 20 / Monk 3 / Shifter 17 who starts as a Druid and then gets Shifter just for the Epic shapes. It's Cernd from the BG saga. I'm certainly not qualified enough to write anything myself, but I'd gladly comment on your guide once you have something cooked up.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the offer. I say YES!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

For example, I have a variant your Graveyard Shifter that ends up as a rogue 19/Shifter16/Druid5. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said I am going to include only ECB submitted builds with their creators credited in my sections, with my personal notes on how I tweak them and why. I supposed I should get around to posting my Mighty Rage+EDR Barb 24/shifter10/druid6 for feedback and approval into the level 40 builds section before I finish this up now that its reached early epics in World of Greyhawk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
