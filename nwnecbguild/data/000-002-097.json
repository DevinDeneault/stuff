      "content": "<div>Hail, Mighty ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was wondering how these two feats interact with each other when a Monk has them both. I have played the Shadow Priest on WoG to level 40, but there's an item there that Clerics can carry on the off-hand that doesn't mess with Monk Ubab progression or AC, so I never actually found out because you need your off-hand to be free to use Deflect Arrows.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat happens when a Monk receives a ranged attack? Does Epic Dodge trigger first, does Deflect Arrows trigger first, or do they trigger simultaneously? How does it work when both are \"active\" and usable at the same time? I'd greatly appreciate it if anyone who knows could share this info.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!</div>",

Deflect Arrows, Epic Dodge and 50% concealment makes you a pain for those pesky Arcane Archers. Good fun in capture the flag.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent fra min SM-G981B via Tapatalk<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>"
