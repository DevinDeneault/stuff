My only suggestion is that disarm/improved disarm are best if you take them together.  I\u2019d likely juggle your feat schedule a smidge and push out Disarm to somewhere close to improved disarm and perhaps pull in improved knockdown.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I see it here in this build, but I tend to arrange my build to work on servers where you can \u201crebuild\u201d I tend to take my first skills at level 2 where feasible AND spend my first level feats on something universal to all builds of a particular type ... like blind fight.  Sometimes causing a little upfront pain but makes it easy to play with later should I need to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see that here, not sure if it was for similar reasons but I was quite pleased to see it regardless.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I forgot craft wand in the build. Silly me. With only level 4 spells this could cover still spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood variant you suggested. For some, maybe many, that is very sensible. For this build, and for what I had in mind, the ultra high Str is what makes it special, it still retains a lot of playability. Finishing on an even modifier for a str two hander is also nice too. Its hard to take LI earlier without dropping Str or EWS. Yes a little min maxing but I think it will work fine here.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Ignoring Curse Song and Taunt, that's still +2 AB, +3 damage, and +5 AC pretty much all day every day for your whole party. In fact (and I know this won't sound much like me) I might even be tempted to stop at Fighter 4 and not bother with EWS at all - with 42 STR and a scythe you don't really need that extra damage bump. And LI is for Bards what ED is for Rogues, after all. It just seems a bit of a waste to wait so long for it.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Actually getting all the bard stuff earlier is nice not just the lasting inspiration. The Lasting Inspiration is just icing on the cake if I'm honest, current build draft has 26 bard levels or 26 usages of Bard/Curse Song combined. Having a 100 round duration bard song is nice but I suspect curse song is going to be more useful, funnily enough, to destroy the opponent's stats and skills. One can then taunt them, improved disarm them, knock them down etc etc... Pity one can't use curse song with a self-silence aura, but at least one can self-dispel the self-silence that pretty easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've playtested this one through solo Saltmarsh -&gt; Three Heads (Borderkeep) -&gt; Necromancer -&gt; Hill Giants -&gt; Dragon Cult I, its level 18 right now<br/>\nThe starting Str 18 is VERY nice, honestly I would not change that<br/>\nThe build is super strong, its like having dev crit except you get it at level 5-10 when you can boost the strength high enough to deal essentially lethal critical hits<br/>\nA little bit of boosting of Con for HP (ie items, Endurance potions) helps with balancing stats early but once RDD 7 is obtained with +2 Con it makes a big difference.<br/>\nAlso having a shield and a one handed weapon in reserve, one loses 1 AB for more defense which is better against mobs, the two handed weapon being very strong in a 1v1 situation, if you have all your buffs up (with UMD, or other), or against mages who will hate you intensely as you approach them invisible with a x4 crit weapon, 30-40 str and a self-silence aura<br/>\nImproved knockdown would be nice, if you dont like craft wand you could drop craft wand for improved knockdown. Having 20-50 casts of bull strength/prot v evil/haste/improved invisibility on a wand is very nice though...<br/>\n<br/>\nEmpyre's split would get a lot more combat feats, making space for potentially still spell and Cha 14(16), and devastating critical<br/>\nThe main downside of a Bard 16 / F 14 / RDD 10 split will be if you want to skill dump say Tumble 40, is that Bard (Curse) 16 Song comes pretty late at level 37+, it is the sweet spot of the bard power.<br/>\nI did design that in mind, trying to get the Bard 16 song asap. The F4/RDD10 that comes preceeding does delay things a little but I believe that cannot be helped, one will want BAB 26 for 4 APR, then RDD 10 for maximal Str boosts/Fire immunity etc.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
