      "content": "<div>Hi all!<br/>\nI'm finishing Mines of Twin Summit with the bard/CT/Cl, and I am having fun with it!<br/>\nI am appreciating very much the combination of arcane arts (even though, bard side, is almost only for buffing) and melee prowess....and I would like to try to play a spellsword. I have seen some post, into this forum (or the old guild, I can't remember at the moment) about them, however I have seen in the vault some modules which take your character from level 1 to level 20. Therefore, I would like to create a lv 20-spellsword, if possible not human (I use this race a lot), as I would like to play something different.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had been wondering of using races I use the least, such as elves and gnomes, and I have quickly put up some ideas into the following build:<br/>\n<br/>\nWizard(17), Fighter(2), Rogue(1), Gnome<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 14 (16)<br/>\nDEX: 12<br/>\nCON: 16<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 16 (19)<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\nGnome: (Defensive Training vs. Giants, Hardiness vs. Enchantments, Low-light Vision, Offensive Training vs. Goblinoids, Offensive Training vs. Reptilians, Skill Affinity: Concentration, Skill Affinity: Listen, Small Stature, Spell Focus: Illusion)<br/>\n01: Fighter(1): Power Attack, Cleave<br/>\n02: Wizard(1): {Scribe Scroll}<br/>\n03: Wizard(2): Weapon Focus: Dagger<br/>\n04: Wizard(3): INT+1, (INT=17)<br/>\n05: Wizard(4)<br/>\n06: Wizard(5): Expertise, Extend Spell<br/>\n07: Wizard(6)<br/>\n08: Wizard(7): INT+1, (INT=18)<br/>\n09: Wizard(8): Knockdown<br/>\n10: Wizard(9)<br/>\n11: Wizard(10): Still Spell<br/>\n12: Wizard(11): INT+1, Blind Fight, (INT=19)<br/>\n13: Wizard(12)<br/>\n14: Wizard(13)<br/>\n15: Wizard(14): Great Fortitude<br/>\n16: Wizard(15): STR+1, Craft Wand, (STR=15)<br/>\n17: Wizard(16)<br/>\n18: Rogue(1): Toughness<br/>\n19: Wizard(17)<br/>\n20: Fighter(2): STR+1, Improved Knockdown, (STR=16)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 174<br/>\nSkillpoints: 134<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 13/9/8<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +5, Mind Effects: +2<br/>\nBAB: 10<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 15 (melee), 12 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 16/26<br/>\nSpell Casting: Wizard(9)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nConcentration 23(28), Disable Trap 10(16), Discipline 23(26), Listen 16(21), Set Trap 5(8), Spellcraft 21(25), Tumble 20(21), UMD 16(15)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Concentration(4), Discipline(4), Save(12), <br/>\n02: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5), Save(11), <br/>\n03: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(14), <br/>\n04: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(17), <br/>\n05: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(20), <br/>\n06: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(23), <br/>\n07: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(26), <br/>\n08: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(30), <br/>\n09: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(34), <br/>\n10: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(38), <br/>\n11: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(42), <br/>\n12: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(46), <br/>\n13: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(50), <br/>\n14: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(54), <br/>\n15: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(58), <br/>\n16: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(62), <br/>\n17: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(66), <br/>\n18: Disable Trap(10), Listen(16), Set Trap(5), Tumble(20), UMD(16), Save(11), <br/>\n19: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(1), Save(14), <br/>\n20: Concentration(1), Discipline(19), <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have some suggestions?

      "content": "<div>Glad you are having fun with the modules Aquarius, now let's proceed with the build.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to keep it with Gnome that's fine but best would be a Dwarf with STR 16(18)/ CON 18(18)/ INT 16(19) equipped with a Greatsword/ GreatAxe. If staying Gnome then equip a Scimitar two-handed for a good dmg boost. You can also delay your third INT boost for last and take the other two STR attributes before that. You just have to take the last WIZ level at 20th instead of 19th lvl. If build primarily for modules, i would also question the usability of Craft Wands so this can be replaced with Empower/ Maximize Spell that is vital for any spellsword in my book. Also i would consider dropping the single rogue lvl for another WIZ one, thus attaining 3 attacks/ Round. You won't miss that much the +2 tumble AC with the defensive buffs a spellsword can have on himself &amp; the extra CL helps a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other thing, consider dropping this into your override folder, some modules like Aielund have a similar fix already incorporated into EMS but this will do it for all modules alike.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/script/improved-tensors-transformation-spell-fix\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://neverwintervault.org/project/nw ... -spell-fix</a></div>"

Tumble as high as possibile to lessen the attack of opportunity's probability.<br/>\nHowever, thinking about the dwarf version, I may think that the \"toughness\" and \"great fortitude\" feats could be useless due to the +2 CON (and, as a consequence, the +1 to fortitude saving throws): could it be replaced with \"spell penetration\" and \"greater spell penetration\"? As a spellsword, my focus for offensive casting should be directed (if useful) for no-save spells, hence I have to overcome spell resistance...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich spell schools do you suggest to specialize at? <br/>\nThe bonus spell slot could really be helpful...(it seems that the Enchantment spells are not useful for a low-DC caster)</div>"

      "content": "<div>Both builds are nice Aquarius, might i suggest to have more confidence in your spellcasting abilities as well and take GSF in Necro for example? What do you think is the difference between your build (with GSF) and another Mage that tries to get the highest DC for his spells? Let me answer that. 3. points. Unlike the Epic builds where one focussed spellcaster will take Gr INT X and ESF in his area of expertise, here the only thing that differs will be the final INT score. In other words you can be a really good mage in addition to being a spellsword! Forget about save boosters and toughness, go for the good ones, GSF in Necro and get a Wail of the Banshee's DC of 33! Spell penetration won't be a problem at these levels, you are nearly a pure mage and when you blast someone (except monks) with a Mord's you lower his SR by Ten (10) points. Don't want to spend a 9th slot for that? Fine, do a Greater Spell Breach then which is a 6th one for Five (5) points. And keep your full plate in a quick-slot so you can put it on in a hurry, preferable after you have fully buffed with premo, extended mantle, shadow shield, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: I believe the reason why you were not able to replicate my starting scores is because you put 12 DEX in there as well, while i would simply do that with a Cat's Grace once i have my full plate. No reason to spend points in DEX really if all you want is a mere 12...</div>"

This kind of builds rely on magic, providing sufficient defense vs physical damage with Ghostly visage early on, and the Stoneskins/Premonition and Improved invisibility later. GMW, Flame weapon, Keen edge etc. add to damage. Fighter provides better weapons, armor, shield and the 3rd attack. The build gets 5 bonus feats, and that gives some freedom when building. <br/>\nAs for sorcerer, you have to do with less feats, and less intelligence, meaning less skills and there is less room for multiclassing with level 9 spells arriving at lvl 18.

Considering the fact that most campaigns in neverwinter nights end even before the 20th level and the plethora of available modules for sub-epic levels, that section of the ECB is indeed under-used as you say. And there are some very good builds to be had in that range as well. I remember an elemental stunner, Druid-Monk from the old ECB archives that made an impression on me. Probably quite a few others as well, that have fade into obscurity nowadays.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo answer the question though, Ominu's Cow Herd's build was more of a \"safe\" spell-slinger rather that a spell-sword like Aquarius is trying to create here. With just 90 hp's, only two attacks, no weapon-related feats and only 13 strength just for taking the divine feats, his focus was really on spells and the occasional easy mob clearing. He used Tenser's of course and he had the all-powerful divine might &amp; shield but without them he can't hold his own till he uses his spells in a grand\u00a0 battle. Not that he needs that if played correctly but its a different play-style. Still a very powerful build though, make no mistake about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere, i will talk some numbers to showcase how it's done the safe spell-slinger way,<br/>\n<br/>\nBase AC (21) + 25 (+5 items) + 1 (dex) + 4 (haste) + 11 (divine shield) + 2 (tumble) = 64 AC and you just fire still-spells being hit only in 20's from the enemies. You can add expertise to that if you really want to overdo it. And he really had powerful saves as well due to the synergy between Pally and Sorceres. And probably better summons as well, due to Animal domain, needs only an 8th lvl spell to bring forth an elder elemental, buff it then let it do the job for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarn, i got carried-away with these strategies, numbers and whatnot...</div>"

It can work at level 20, but the two last levels really add much to the power with full level 8 and 9 spell casting and +3 AB.<br/>\nI took 2 warrior levels pre-epic to get the 3rd attack. Ranger adds martial weapons, an off hand attack and a greater spell-focus. Paladin adds saves and a second skill-dump.<br/>\nOne may ask when to take Ranger. I wanted stoneskin first. Before that you can use a crossbow or any finessable simple weapon.<br/>\nThere is full flexible spontaneous casting, with normal casting from base spell level slots and then with silent spell for casting from +1 slots, empower for +2 slots, maximize +3 slots and quicken for casting from +4 slots. IMO that makes sorcerer worth it.<br/>\nYou can tweak with extend- instead of silent spell.

Hasted you get 5 attacks per round with an average of about 120 damage per round on low AC targets.<br/>\nSelf buffed AC is: 4 deflection AC from Shield, 5 neutral AC from Shadow shield, 1 armor AC from Mage armor, and 5 dodge AC from MA and Haste, and AC from Cat's, ending at about 33. Factor in Premonition, Improved invisibility and the reciprocal damage shields. <br/>\nAll that is about melee presence, so it is not only a caster, even if I have given most attention to the casting.</div>",

You can even pick Transmutation if you want to spam Flesh to stone.\u00a0 No matter what school you choose, it is important to pick spells that target different saves,so you have spells that target the weak save of your opponent, be it\u00a0 low fortitude,\u00a0 low reflex or even low will. Necromancy is generally better vs creatures with low fortitude and Evocation is better vs creatures with low reflex saves.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I talk about blasting, I think of how many times you can cast a given spell with all the metamagical options (silent, empower, max and quicken). If you wade into an area with foes that are vulnerable to fire, this character can cast Firebrand more than 30 times and back it up with 14 fireballs before he has to resort to 15 castings of Burning hands. If you don't want to do that, you can choose to spam 6 Wails and 12 Fingers of Death and still have all your level 6 slots and below for backup.<br/>\nThat is why I want all the metamagical feats in there, so he can cast his spells from more slots. <br/>\nEven though this is a spellsword, if I build with sorcerer, I want him to be able to act like a sorcerer. If not, you can just as well build with wizard.</div>",

I also do not see any of Bigby's hands and they are super powerful especially so the 6th &amp; 7th level ones. Greater stoneskin can go, you have \"premonition\" on your list. Hmm, I suppose \"mind blank\" isn't essential if you play primarily on modules, so you can skip it provided that you have access to clarity potions. I like that you try to build a \"Classic Evoker\" type of mage, a war-wizard of Cormyr/witch-queen of Aglarond type of caster but in reality elemental spells do almost nothing at higher levels as the most common tactic of old modules/adventures in order to raise the level of danger was to simply increase the hit points &amp; number of adversaries, which in turn makes the elemental spells even weaker than they are. Anyway, the most surefire method to get things done in Nwn, will always be to buff yourself till you look like a Christmas tree &amp; take your trusty greatsword in hand then rush to battle yourself, pausing only to cast the occasional Mord's/ Bigby's/ FoD on hard targets.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope i helped some, i am sure Mick, Empyre, Stag &amp; the others will chime in as well with further suggestions for spells &amp; tactics.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Thank you all for your insights and contribution!<br/>\n<br/>\nMick, you are right in saying that there is a best set of spells for the current situation. In fact, considering also Valerfor's messages, I had written my question in a misunderstanding way: my concern was on the need, for a lv. 20/22 spellsword (so, at the maximum level attainable as per the thread's title), for evocation spells based on elements and saves.<br/>\nI have yet to begin playing as a sorcerer, however (taking a little inspiration from the wiz/fighter toon that I'm playing) I felt that some spells, such as \"prismatic spray\", \"Cloud of bewilderment\" and \"Cloudkill\", but also \"Lighting bolt\" and \"Mestil's Acid Breath\" can be used only at levels lesser than 20. As some of them are of low level, their DC would surely be lower and, as a consequence, much more opponents would pass the save roll.<br/>\nIf I get the point, Valerfor confirmed it:<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>elemental spells do almost nothing at higher levels as the most common tactic of old modules/adventures in order to raise the level of danger was to simply increase the hit points &amp; number of adversaries, which in turn makes the elemental spells even weaker than they are.</em><br/>\n<br/>\nThat can maybe explain also the fact that wizards are seen as a disablers (hence, a support to the team); instead, the sorcerers are considered as blasting forces, wyou ith AoE spells. Sorcerers have access to much more spells per day than wizards, so they can launch much more spells with save (that, at higher levels, are required because they are weaker, as Valerfor said).<br/>\nI take advantage of this post to explain my thoughts, in order for you to correct something if wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.: loved that you have to buff as a \"Christmas tree\" <span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83d\ude00</span></div>"

Equally, if you take the 2nd of Rogue at 18 you could get another +5 to your UMD - but you'd have to sacrifice your 5 points in Heal, which might seem odd for a cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a couple of thoughts<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Oh, and for what it's worth, I'm with Empyre on the Imp Crit over Expertise - especially with a scimitar.</div>",

The fighter level saves you feats by providing AP Heavy, WP Martial and even offers an extra bonus feat. The level 19 and 20 songs are almost identical, and both are hard to get enough Perform for. The hit on spells is not dramatic.<br/>\n<br/>\nBa16/F4 gets a 4th attack and 3 bonus combat feats, including WS. You still have the level 16 song. With Cha 16 and a skill focus, you can reach perform 29 and self buff it to 30 (or use an item with a skill bonus). You need bonus slots if you want level 6 spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nBa15/F1/RDD4 gets the free feats from F1 and the +4 Str bonus and +1 AC bonus from RDD. There are 3 attacks per round. You have a level 15 song, which is almost as good as the level 16 song. AB is better than the Ba19/F1. You only have level 5 spells. GMW still gives a +5 enhancement.<br/>\n<br/>\nBa12/F4/RDD4 is a strong melee character with 4 attacks, bonus combat feats and AB bonus from RDD Strength. You only get a level 11 song, but it is still far better than a level 8 song. Spell casting is limited to level 4, much like rangers and paladins, and the build borders on not being a spellsword anymore. GMW now gives a +4 enhancement.</div>",
