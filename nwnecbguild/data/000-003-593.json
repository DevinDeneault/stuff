      "content": "<div>Hello people.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found a bit of an oddity with the monk ability Flurry of blows.\n<table class=\"post_content_table\"><tbody><tr><td>Armor+Kama</td>\n<td>Kama+Kama</td>\n<td>Shield+Kama</td>\n<td>Unarmed+Armor</td>\n<td>Unarmed+Shield</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Works</td>\n<td>Works</td>\n<td>Doesn't work</td>\n<td>Works</td>\n<td>Works</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\nSo my idea for using this is fairly straight forward, it allows me to be a dual-wielding strength based full plate wearing awesome dude. My initial idea is for a Cleric/Monk/Fighter.<br/>\nThe problem i am having is attributes. Ambidexterity requires 15 dexterity and is necessary for Improved two-weapon fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far the build looks like this:<br/>\nMonk 1<br/>\nCleric 1-20<br/>\nFighter 1-6 (For weapon specialization and bonus feats!)<br/>\nCleric 21-32<br/>\nMonk 2 (For tumble and discipline)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the starting attributes is the problem, i picked human.<br/>\nStrength 16 (+7 from levels, +7 from feats)<br/>\nDexterity 15 (For ambidexterity)<br/>\nConstitution 10<br/>\nWisdom 16 (+3 from levels)<br/>\nIntelligence 8<br/>\nCharisma\u00a0 8<br/>\n<br/>\nThis leaves my constitution and intelligence way too low. The build is also very rough around the edges at the moment.</div>"

A full plate would effectively give 8 armor class where as with dex+wis i'd have at least 6 just from base stats. The reason i want to go Strength based is simply put damage, same reason for the fighter levels - 6 damage per attack starts to matter when you have 4 (BAB)+1 (Flurry)+1 (Haste)+2 (Dual)=8 attacks per round. Add a few more if using monk UBAB ;)</div>"

      "content": "<div>Well, as long as the Heavy Armor is giving you more AC, then it would be wise to go with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the AC bonus (assuming that Robes and Armor get the same bonuses) is 8.\u00a0 If you have Dex and Wis bonus that is 8 or more, then there is no real reason to wear Heavy Armor (other than if one is worried about being flatfooted and loosing Dodge AC).<br/>\n<br/>\nTo that, of course, is the Attack progression.\u00a0 It is much more advantageous to use Monk UBAB with Fighter AB than it is not to.\u00a0 One will tend to hit more in a round than not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did not question going Strength - in fact, I made no reference to that.\u00a0 I did make reference to Fighter, since you want to dual wield and are having questions about stats related to the dual wield feats.\u00a0 One way around that is to go Ranger to pick up the dual wield feats without having to have the prereq stats for doing so.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one plans to do the total ITWF feat compilation, then the Ranger is out as a class unless one is willing to take 9 levels of Ranger.\u00a0 As that is \"only\" 3 levels more than your build takes in Fighter, I think that is relatively painless.\u00a0 1 more Ranger level (10 total) will net you 2 FEs, with damage bonuses, respectively.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I raised the Ranger at all was because you stated in your post that your Int and Con were way too low.\u00a0 By going Ranger instead of Fighter, one would be able to go with reduced Dex and therefore increase both Int and Con, respectively without sacrificing ITWF.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, this will also be dependent on not wearing anything more than medium armor - though if your Wis and Dex bonus is more than 7 combined, this is a non-issue.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Where will you be playing this build? How important is playability versus level 40 power? In terms of not having enough INT or CON, are there specific skills you want? or a desired minimum amount of hit points? What are you using or planning for spell feats (magic or meta magic)? What about Devastating Critical?<br/>\n<br/>\nI would recommend reading the Cleric guide that Maximillian Kane wrote : <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/an-insight-into-the-cleric-class-t515461.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">An Insight into the Cleric Class</a>.<br/>\nWith only 19-20 Wisdom, changing the level spread to limit Cleric to somewhere between 20-26 levels and spending the extra levels elsewhere will give more flexibility. 24 levels are required for undispellable buffs (outside of Mord's). Also with a point buy system, keeping starting stat points at 14 or below will allow for a more optimal distribution. As an example, you need 15 DEX for Ambidexterity, but you don't need it at level 1; dropping starting DEX to 14 gives 2 stat points for CON or INT. Cleric has Great Wisdom as an epic bonus feat; Chamption of Torm also has Great Wisdom as epic bonus feat, which can be used to boost WIS to the desired level.<br/>\n<br/>\nPicking 3 base classes will subject the build to XP penalties while leveling. Using a prestige class as the third class will avoid XP penalties while leveling, such as Blackguard or Champion of Torm.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeeping with the original request of having a Cleric/Monk/Fighter, if you want Dev Crit and dual wield kamas you could change the level split to something like C 26 / M 2 / F 12<br/>\nDevastating Critical is a heavy investment of feats: (Power Attack, Great Cleave, Improved Critical, Overwhelming Critical, and Devastating Critical).\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>\nSTR 16 (30) 7 levels/7feats\nCON 12\u00a0\nINT 10\n\n02: Cleric(1) [level 1 spells]\n04: Cleric(3): DEX+1, (DEX=15) [level 2 spells]\n06: Cleric(5): Empower Spell [level 3 spells]\n08: Cleric(7): STR+1, (STR=17) [level 4 spells]\n10: Cleric(9) [level 5 spells]\n12: Cleric(11): STR+1, Ambidexterity, (STR=18) [level 6 spells, can't cast]\n14: Cleric(13) [level 7 spells, can't cast]\n16: Cleric(15): STR+1, ,(STR=19) [level 8 spells, can't cast]\n18: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus (Kama), Improved Critical (Kama)\n20: Fighter(3): STR+1, (STR=20)\n22: Fighter(5)\n24: Fighter(7): STR+1, Great Strength II, (STR=23)\n26: Fighter(9)\u00a0\n28: Fighter(11): STR+1, (STR=25)\n30: Cleric(17): Great Strength IV, (STR=26)\u00a0 [level 9 spells, can't cast]\n32: Cleric(19): WIS+1 (WIS=16) [enables level 6 spells]\n34: Cleric(21)\n36: Cleric(23): WIS+1, Great Strength VI, Great Wisdom I, (STR=28) (WIS=18) [enables level 7&amp;8 spells]\n38: Monk(2)\n40: Cleric(26): STR+1, Great Wisdom II (STR=30) [enables level 9 spells]\nHP: 384\nSkills : 139\nDiscipline: 41\nTumble: 40\nAB (Kama dual-wield): (41 w/ divine power)\noff hand: 36/33\nAC (naked): 24\nSaves (Fort/Reflex/Will): 26/20/27\n</details>\n<strong>Pros</strong>: Dev Crit; KD to disable casters<br/>\n<strong>Cons</strong>: no BF/Listen so susceptible to flat-foot against invisible opponents; delays level 6-9 spells<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf wanting to avoid the XP penalty while leveling and stay Good or Neutral then a CoT build is an option.<br/>\nBelow is a build that doesn't get Dev Crit but has more INT and so more skills to distribute and gets the bonus saves from CoT<br/>\n<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>STR 16 (30) 7 levels/7feats\nCON 10\u00a0\nINT 14\n\n02: Cleric(1) [level 1 spells]\n04: Cleric(3): DEX+1, (DEX=15) [level 2 spells]\n06: Cleric(5): Empower Spell [level 3 spells]\n08: Cleric(6): WIS+1, (WIS=15)\u00a0\n10: Cleric(8)\n12: Cleric(10): WIS+1, Ambidexterity, (WIS=16)\u00a0\n14: Cleric(12)\u00a0\n16: Cleric(14): STR+1, (STR=17)\u00a0\n18: Cleric(15): Improved Two Weapon Fighting [level 8 spells, can't cast]\n20: Cleric(17): STR+1, (STR=18) [level 9 spells, can't cast]\n22: Cleric(19)\n24: Cleric(21): STR+1, Great Strength II, (STR=21)\n26: Cleric(23): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=17) [Enables level 7 spells]\u00a0\n28: Champion of Torm(1): STR+1, (STR=23)\n30: Champion of Torm(3): Great Strength IV, (STR=24)\n32: Monk(5): STR+1 (STR=25)\n34: Champion of Torm(6): Epic Weapon Focus (Kama)\n36: Champion of Torm(7): STR+1, Great Strength VI, (STR=28)\n38: Cleric(25)\n40: Cleric(26): STR+1, Great Wisdom IV, (STR=30) (WIS=20)\nAlternatively could take Armor Skin @ 40, for +1 AC (Monk AC gets a boost from WIS 20)\nHP: 376\nSkills points : 233\u00a0\nDiscipline: 42\nSpot: 25\nSpellcraft: 40\n\nmain hand: 36/33/30/27/24\u00a0+10 dmg (crit 20)\n\n</details>\n<strong>Pros</strong>: Higher Saves from CoT, no leveling XP penalty, BF + Listen combo, +1 Monk AC (level 5)<br/>\n<strong>Cons</strong>: no dev crit; no WS/EWS; delays level 7-9 spells<br/>\n<strong>Meh</strong>: gets KD/IKD at the end of build so more utility at max level, Monk Speed, Toughness instead of extra CON<br/>\n<br/>\nIf wanting to use the BG prestige class, and are ok with the Evil alignment, then I'd recommend looking at Orion's\u00a0dual-wielding BG/Monk/Cleric :\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/unholy-hurricane-of-death-c-13-m-2-bg-25-10-attks--t2355065.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Unholy Hurricane of Death (C 13 / M 2 / BG 25)</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps or at least gives some ideas on how to tweak the original concept.</div>"
