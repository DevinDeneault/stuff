Another good option is to make a cleric with 1 level of monk. You can use a full plate, kama and shield. Cast divine power and flurry away. This allows you to be strength based and you get powerful spells like Harm to aid you. It will actually attack faster than the pure monk.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Not that will matter, because Empyre's got a few great high monk builds.\u00a0<br/>\nEmpyre65 wrote a <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/concept-yardstick-builds-t2293896-s10.html#p3452\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Yardstick level 40 monk build</a>, in the Yardstick section post number 11.\u00a0<br/>\nPerhaps the first 20 levels could be used? It looks nice to me. The one I linked is dex based.\u00a0<br/>\nThere's also another version which goes low strength for more dex on <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/concept-yardstick-builds-t2293896-s10.html#p3486\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">post 20</a>, if you want that, but I like the first one better with more strength in the build.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
