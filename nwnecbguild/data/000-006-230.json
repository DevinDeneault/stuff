      "content": "<div>Robbing from the Rich and Feeding the Poor PvM (1-40) and PvP<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Robin Hood (Wildwood Warrior) <br/>\nBy Tyr Templar</strong><br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>Author\u2019s Note:</strong> This build, Robin Hood (Wildwood Warrior) is one of several characters in my \"Tales of Robin Hood (Wildwood)\" series which I kicked off in 2007, with Robin (as a true-to-life Knight) making his debut in the ECB on April 9, 2007. All characters are being revisited in light of the patch. To see the original build, click: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build270518.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 70518.html</a> . What follows is the build.</div></blockquote>\n<br/>\n<strong>Concept: </strong>This character, the Wildwood Warrior, is inspired by the legendary Robin Hood aka the Prince of Thieves:  the legendary character (as is believed by some) is himself inspired by a British noble (knight) turned outlaw, or so the story goes, a \u201cwoodland pirate\u201d of sorts, who is said to have defied the King by living in the forest with his \u201cband of merry men\u201d after having his lands seized by the Crown for unpaid taxes (which allegedly accrued and went unpaid while he was away serving a knight's post), laying wayward travelers (allegedly taking from the \u201crich to give to the poor\u201d), and hunting the King\u2019s Deer in violation of the King\u2019s Law.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeer were protected by the King for sport hunting, to be enjoyed at leisure by himself and his nobles, during a time when there was no assistance or social-safety net for the poor, such that the laws (preventing people from hunting for food, for e.g.) led to starvation, while nobles enjoyed their leisure hunting and sport. Regardless, and whether the man (or men) upon whom the legendary Robin Hood was supposedly based limited his \u201ctaking\u201d from the \"rich\" alone, or to all who passed, his thievery was said to be carried out with courtesy, skill and piety; while he glorified violence in a time of violence, it was the medieval ages, when so very few had enough to eat, much less any land and, with no education or assistance, the vast majority simply had little or no opportunity to better their station in life. Hence, the legend of Robin Hood: a man, a knight and an outlaw, whether based on truth or fiction, is the story of a scoundrel turned egalitarian and philanthropist who, from the C 16th onwards became the poster boy for philanthropy; it is a legend that continues to inspire philanthropy. His legend is one that endeared him to the people in past as it still does today, a \"national hero\u201d in the eyes of the people, for he did that which his King could not (or would not) do: namely, take care of and provide for the poor.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Robin Hood (Wildwood Warrior) Ranger(9), Weapon Master(19), Fighter(12)</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>I.

Wave bye-bye to your foe (Robin is a seasoned Knight, after all)], while theme-wise being a cross between Quarterstaff and Mace; this, as a \u201ccompromise\u201d so far as the mace was also a side arm of medieval warriors (standard issue for bashing (bludgeon) enemies pre-plate, and to wrap around shields) but at the same time incorporating the staff legends of Robin Hood so far as the tales are quite clear that, during a show down with Little John on a bridge, Robin was bested by the latter, who beat him off the bridge with a stick (aka quarter staff, but which NWN is not a double-sided but, rather, a large weapon, contrary to the description). <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>**Alternative Path\u2014Dev.Crit: Don\u2019t want double weapon spec, prefer Dev.Crit instead?</strong><br/>\nIf so and/or not interested in theme, then feel free to drop second weapon (in which case, select kurki as main and in this case only weapon (wonderful range i.e. 13-20/x3 / Keen: 10-20/x3), forcing those crits and chewing through foes like there's no tomorrow, while enabling sword+board/AC when desired as well). Take Power Attack and Cleave at Lev 6 (instead of WF/WS 2nd weapon), Grt.Cleave at Lvl 20 (instead of IC: 2nd weapon), picking up OC: kukri at lvl 34 (instead of WoC: 2nd weapon), DC: kukri at lvl 37 (instead of Epic Toughness, -20HPs or 480 adj); additionally, instead of EWF/EWS 2nd weapon at levels 21 and 33, grab EITHER Epic Fort along with Grt.Fort (+6 Fort, or Fort: 28 adj; recommended if looking to PvP your Robin in dev.crit arena) \u2013OR- 2 more Grt.STR (STR 34 adj., i.e. +1AB/Dam., or: Naked AB 50, and +1 DC on Dev.Crit, or: DC: 42 / 48 bio-cap) et voila: dev.crit instead. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor those fans who prefer their Robin Hood not as a true-to-life knight but, rather, as a legendary archer (as he was portrayed in subsequent legends), see: Robin of Locksley, Wildwood Outlaw: (placeholder).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now back to our regularly scheduled program\u2026<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>III.

      "content": "<div>Thanks, Theophilus. Appreciate both the questions and the compliment (thanks). Please know I had a great time revisiting this one post-patch as I did in the old home pre-patch. Also appreciate your quetsion re: Robin time sequence, which gets into questions surrounding Robin as man or myth (for the most part I agree with Lines and you both, i.e., initially seen as an archer, with bards taking license ovrer the years; however, there are seemingly 3 main versions of the tale (in two of which he's a knight), and which I'll get to after the build question.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Rangers Dual Wield in Light Armor.</strong> <br/>\nCorrect. Wear light armor when wanting to pound on/bludgeon enemies like there's no tomorrow--dire mace especially nice w. WM crit.crazy factor, heh, /x3 multiplier, w. STR, FTR WS/EWS coming at your foe x's  6 apr (7 apr hasted), thanks to ranger, with all of that damage tripling on a crit! Also great against sneak/crit immune--i.e. Undeads (all that apr, str and bludgeon damage, heh. Works good v Pale Masters, too, though those looking to engage in a little PvP will no doubt prefer dev.crit dual wield kukri path as set out under the level guide as option--have fun!),. Meantime, double weapon option covering off different damage types is a great thing to have, even better with different armor options to enjoy as well as is the case here, too (different situations call for different things, PvM/E especially).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen go sword+board of it (especially in the beginning, waiting for your dual to kick in. and any time you should want thereafter, too), you'll enjoy best armor you can find, as you find it while levelling--i.e., magic medium being better than mundane plate for e.g., with light armor (i.e., studded) unlike plate having room for 3 more AC from DEX (simple cat's scroll for e.g. will do it, depending on the roll, finding dex items along the way, too), which is something when dual wield you'll want to add (plate's already capped, only allows room for 1 dex ac which you've got from the get-go, but light armor has room for 4 dex ac altogether, so take advantage of it; in turn, difference b/w plate and light armor's only a mere 2 ac, which isn't an issue (no biggie, especially not with this AB/damage output). Of cousre,  if situation is one where you want to go sword+board of it even after dual kicks in, then why not prep for battle in full dress battle gear (i.e. plate). Won't enjoy 6 apr (7 apr haste) but, heh, bastard sword in hands of WM enjoys a really nice crit.crazy factor, too, while delivering really nice consistent, slashing damage. Nice to have options/versatility (melee-style) is always good, I think so, too.   <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Play-Tip:</strong> <br/>\nIf while dual wielding should find yourself suddenly swarmed by an inordinate number of crit/sneak immunes like undeads or something and for some reason can't break em into groups/chunks (when does that happen?!!), can't swap armor mid-battle but can swap weapons--i.e., sword+board. Or, better yet,  pull on expertise mode for more AC and keep on dual wielding, pounding through dem bones with all your 6 apr (7 hasted) in tact, pound em right into dust I say, en route to the \"big boss\" and then let him have it! (Epic WM afterall, not an issue). Ah, but even better still, enjoy your whirlwind attack! (Fixed 1.69 so working now, heh, not only effective but also looks really cool, and with the double-bladed dire mace you'll look great doing it, too). Lots of options (importance of options being true of effective/deadly warriors since the dawn of time, and remains true of modern military forces today). Only weakness is that which is oh so typical of melee--namely, will save, but that also happens to be one of if not the easist thing to shore up --i.e., clarity potions, so not an issue (clarity potions are our friend, as is generally true of all melee builds)]. <br/>\n<br/>\nSllash/Pound...er, Take from the Rich, Give to the Poor ON! ~ Tyr</div>"

      "content": "<div><strong>History Stuff: Of Legends and Medieval Armor, etc.</strong><br/>\nLOVE it, and glad you asked. <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Robin Hood: Man or Myth?</strong><br/>\nYou guys are both right, there being many different versions of Robin over the centuries. the 1930s version  with Errol Flynn (the Saxon Robin, Earl of Locksley) being but only one adaptation (a good one, but there are others). There are tales about Robin which actually take place before the Liohnearted, though most place him in the time of Richard I (about a series/sequence of historical events, namely: time of the Crusades, and Richard I gets kidnapped, taxes raised so as to raise a King's ransom for his purported return by John who takes over in his absense, only for corruption, greed and injustice to set in during his reign, lands being seized/taken, many people are starving, with no sign of relief). Tales, however, do vary. In many Robin's a commoner, but in yet another he's an outlaw plain and simple, in others he is not. Some have \"claimed\" to have actually found Robin's grave, but such claims are dismissed by most. Others put Robin squarely in the time of Richard I\u2019s reign as said, though by no means all. Some say he was a knight-noble proper, others say he wasn\u2019t a noble, focusing on him as archer instead (blade being second), yet in most (if not all) there\u2019s  the telling about his battle with John on the bridge, an important battle which is really about leadership above all else.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeantime, in some which say Robin wasn\u2019t of noble birth to begin with (only nobles could be knights), we see Robin going on to become one on being knighted by Richard I; this, as a reward for his loyalty and service (to King and Country), and which also just so happens to let Robin win Lady Marion's hand who herself was a high borne noble, thus getting both \u201criches\u201d (title, land) \u2013AND- the \u201cgirl\u201d \u2026 (though Marion wasn't part of the story initially, her character coming in later among some others of the Merry Band, her role was rather important and increasingly so over time as well). <br/>\n<br/>\nNo matter how one slices it\u2014or is that pounds?!\u2014the tale, all versions, are about events transpiring in jolly OLD England, being about the only thing the story tellers agree upon (and if the reign of Richard I is taken to be the correct time period, then it would have been the case that Robin as Knight\u2014whether an honor bestowed upon him by noble birthright or subsequently by Richard I\u2014outlived Richard I (who died rather young). <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the only other thing the legends agree on and central to the theme is Robin\u2019s famous rallying call (\"take from the rich, give to the poor\"), which came about (most versions) due to a certain sequence of events which, although those events/sequence somewhat vary, have a basis in historical fact; it is about these events the bard is telling us--as seen by Robin et al. who was \u201cthere\u201d at the relevant time, doing something about it and living to tell the bard about it, which bards (there be a few) telling all of us about it in turn, taking artistic license along the way in doing so, most true. As the story teller, I am of course entitled to that very same artistic license as well. Though I try to be \u201ctrue\u201d, I do get to pick which among all versions of Robin I like best, yes? And in this build/version we explore Robin as Knight (for those who prefer their Robin depicted as archer, stay tuned as I\u2019m in the process of revising that one and whole Wildwood series with new characters joining in and soon to make their debut as well. So stay tuned, Robin Hood fans!). <br/>\n<br/>\nGive to the Poor ON! ~ Tyr<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: remove typos, clarify changes in story-line.</div>"

      "content": "<div><strong>Arms and Armor--History Discussion: </strong><br/>\nI'm not an expert (not a museum curator or archaeologist or anything like that), but history is a passion of mine, so have read quite a lot about it (also visiting museums, checking out the armor, too; yeah, that is great stuff!). OK, we're going with the stories placing Robin in the time of Richard I (born  1157 AD and King from 1189 until his death in 1199), so armor options available at the time include:<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Leather.</strong> Relatively cheap and easily accessible material to obtain during medieval times. Pure leather armor was relatively widespread during early middle ages (800 -1100 AD); used thereafter, too, but for the most part used as a foundation for other materials to construct other types of armor, and well into the Late Middle Ages. Also during this period a type of boiled waxy leather (cuir boilli), used sometimes on its own or decorated with other defenses, but about which there's debate. Depicted on Knight tombs as late as the early 13th century. <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Leather/Plate Hybrids: </strong><br/>\n<strong>Splintered</strong>, which is a plate/leather hybrid, constructed of long, narrow plate strips (splints) riveted onto a leather backing, and was used in early through high Middle Ages (primarly for greaves and bracers as I understand it, for the torso most wore either <strong>Brigadine</strong> or<strong> Mail </strong>(available from 900 AD onwards, the term \"chain\" being a Victorian term for it later on, and which replaced scale on becoming more commercially available--i.e., price wise), or the Coat of Plates, which was another hybrid, but which wasn't really available until later. (The construction eventually giving rise to plate, which wasn't cheap!).<br/>\n<br/>\nLamellar: During this same period there was Lamellar armor, which was similar to scale except that, unlike scale where the metal scales are laced onto a leather backing, the metal scales were laced to each other instead (thus hot, loud and heavy). Peak era of use as I understand it was 1000-1250 AD. Closest NWN being Plate, there being no \"Lamellar\" in-game. Its use was widespread in the East, but also seen in Europe during the relevant time period (early and high Middle ages), especially in areas close to Middle-East (Byzantine Empire, Italy), where the battle field was, and thus available to knights including Robin Hood as such. I do so hope I got all the dates right, and trust that this helps (and great discussion: thanks!).<br/>\n<br/>\n ... Slash/Pound ON! ~ Tyr</div>"

So good it should have additional prereqs you say? Well, been enough nerfs in the patch as of late (though in this case, 1.69 fixed whirlwind, having no negative effects only good ones thus on all 3 class combo here in effect, so that's a good thing!) but seeing the stats on dire mace here, heh, heh.

KD allowing you to down everything up to one-size up, works good for everything other than huge things like dragons; heh, cut em up like a good knight should, yes? (Hey, knights aren't supposed to play with their food. LOL). All fun aside, when it comes to  KD though, that is indeed important on a melee, I agree (and why it's on this build!). <br/>\n<br/>\nRanger is best both theme-wise and build-wise (CoT would give more saves, always nice,  but ranger gives us dual wield for free without the need to raise dex beyond WM requirements, a nice skillset for a melee (including deadly traps. [Traps adding both flavor and versatilty to the build, theme-wise and also build-wise, being deadly effective, coming in all flavors (different damage types), thus more options apart from and in addition to toe to toe combat, which is nice to have, see: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Trap#Notes\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Trap#Notes</a> .They're nice, yes?). Also, unlike CoT, ranger class entitles use of ranger items, scrolls, such as among others grease, freedom and cat's, thus more options yet in turn. And yes, theme-wise Robin was a ranger, most true, living in the woods, etc., there being no divergence in opinion among the bards/story tellers on that, such that ranger is  best, theme-wise and build-wise.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the Warlord's breastplate, whether made of leather or metal, breast plate has been around since antiquity and one of the last pieces of functional armor to be abandoned after the rise of the musket, whose high velocity bullets saw plate fall out of fashion.  And that, like the adaptation and development of arms and armor itself, is the beauty here as well: as noted at the outset, wear what you want as you want, with knights enjoying the \"best\" available to them at the relevant time, depending on the situation of course. So go ahead and enjoy them all! (Too cool, and thanks).<br/>\n<br/>\nSlash/Pound ON! ~ Tyr<br/>\n<br/>\n* EDIT: add info re: \"breast plate\"</div>"

Perhaps you might prefer him. Otherwise, different character. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn this build, which sees Robin as a knight, who returns home from the front to find his nation in shambles, his lands seized and the people suffering, being bent and determined on doing something about it, I like my +6 damage (WS/EWS) as against everything on the NWN planet as opposed to what , with 9 ranger here, would be but a mere 2 damage vs only 2 enemies, and those enemies alone (WS/EWS is better here, as this isn't a BoE/epic ranger/Pal build like Lionheart, but a Ranger/FTR/WM build instead, focusing on Epic WM/Ranger as such, using ranger to pick up epic feats, dual-wield, skills ie deadly traps and ranger item entitlement, scrolls, etc.), with figher for feats (including WS/EWS) and epic WM for SWF and crit.crazy factor (nice on Bastard Sword but super nice on dire mace, all that apr and all), build-wise and theme-wise.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that WS/EWS is on both sides of the double-bladed dire mace, too, in addtion to being str based, and all that damage (each and every point of it) tripling on a crit. as well. In other words, wave bye bye to your foe. Yes, I enjoy power, but I also enjoy theme as well (obviously!). Myself, I see Robin as a strong warrior/knight and all that that means (in this version, archer fans stay tuned), who went off to live in the woods with the Merry Band, etc. as we know, and what in turn this build speaks to and is all about.   <br/>\n<br/>\nGive to the Poor ON! ~ Tyr<br/>\n<br/>\nPS Glad to hear I inspired you! if you'd like some assistance, feel free to post it up in the concept area of the guild or send me a PM.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: add links to another build in Wildwood Series.</div>"

Let\u2019s talk about AC once again (from the perspective of melee of course, this is after all a melee build!).Said it before and will say it again: AC don\u2019t kill things, high AB/damage set ups kill things (deadly traps and entitlement to ranger items, scrolls is sure nice, too, heh). <br/>\n<br/>\nTo put it another way, there was some years ago a challenge in the ECB concept-wise re: pure (Naked) AB (there being +12 stat and +20 weaponry/UMD caps NWN/NWN2, beyond which one cannot go), the winner unsurprisingly was a dex-er, achieving a naked AB 50+.  Cool concept, but zero damage (so not very playable in turn). Harkening back to those days, and as we see, Robin enjoys a Naked AB 49 [easily squeeze one more AB in here if drop the second weapon spec, raise STR for a Naked AB 50 as per the level guide, such that Robin is himself in that \"club\u201d territory (epic WM and high STR combined will do that)]. But as cool a concept as that dex-pecker was, it\u2019ll still be dex-pecking away at but a single soldier long after Robin with  high AB/damage output (dev.crit kurki or wielding different weapons thus different damage types) has cleared an entire regiment.   <br/>\n<br/>\nNotwithstanding, in terms of AC, Robin meets or exceeds the \"good melee standard\" . Enjoys more AC when in full battle dress (Plate) and going sword+board of it than typical fighter does in same gear [most melee don't raise dex, no reason to when wear plate, and they quite simply don't enjoy Robin's AB/damage output either. Also, when it comes to HPs, Robin well exceeds standards in that department, too (at 500HPs, Robin's are very good)]; Plate is an option here (thanks to FTR), and which you\u2019ll enjoy in the beginning in terms of leveling, and any time you should want after dual kicks in, as said. Difference b/w Plate and Studded with dex is only a mere 2 ac (actually, it's effectively only -1 ac vis-a-vis most other melee in light of the fact Robin also has dodge!), and which simply is not an issue when enjoying high AB/damage output (the dead don\u2019t strike back). Chances are, you won\u2019t once dual kicks in want to wear plate, but you have it with you in case you should. Meantime, if in mid-battle you should want more AC while dual wielding in light armor, either swap to Sword+Board \u2013OR- turn on Expertise Mode (Robin has the AB to use it!). That\u2019s 5 AC, thus easily covering off difference as b/w plate and light armor, with more to spare (so don\u2019t need more tumble either, x-classed for the benefit to AC as already have mobility and spring attack to run around in combat, etc., whether in light armor or Sword+Board in full battle dress gear (Plate), avoiding AoOs without more). <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, the game provides a whole assortment of feats expressly made for melee which melee can and should take advantage of, which Robin has.<br/>\n<br/>\nSlash/Bludgeon ON! ~ Tyr<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: remove typo(<strong>s</strong>).</div>"

Ranger also gives access to a better skillset, 18 more skillpoints and \"ranger\" items and scrolls. <br/>\nFighter 11/COT 10 (better than fighter 12/COT 9) gives +5 to saves and 4 combat feats instead of the ranger stuff. That is not enough to cover EWF, EP, TWF, Ambidexterity and ITWF. Ambidexterity and ITWF would also require dex 15.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would probably rather have gone the Kukri route that Tyr suggests. I also like to have PA in my WM builds, because the high AB often allows you to use it for a fat +5 damage to every hit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see Ftr/ WM with 2 or 3 rogue levels as an interesting alternative. Robin went rogue, didn't he? (I didn't say Prince of Thieves - no I didn't    )<br/>\nThe build will have to start with str 16, dex 15 and leave the rest as is. One will need one more G. str to be par str wise. More fighter/WM will give bonus feats, and dropping the second weapon focus/specialization should bring balance to the feat account. Rogue gives evasion, SA, access to UMD (for items and scrolls) and a great skillset with Tumble as class skill (+4 AC). The AB will be the same if rogue is taken in epic levels, or even better if it is possible to squeeze in 3 or more WM levels. Dropping one of the scouting skills gives room for UMD.

      "content": "<div>Mick,<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to build something else, by all means do so in another thread. Robin was not a sneak-damaging rogue, and no, it wouldn't be better than AB 50 (dual wield dev.crit kukri, with a Naked DC 42!) -or- AB 49 (double weapon focus, two different weapons with full foci and also full WS/EWS specialization on both, thus different damage types and dual apr, high STR, etc., and also 500 HPs! As in, REAL melee HPs. Real melee options/versatility, dem ranger goodies be nice, too). CoT would give saves, but among other things would lose skills like traps, ranger access entitlement to ranger items, scrolls, etc., and would also need to meet DEX req'ts just in order to dual [costing not only 3 feats but also STR in the process as well just to get what it is that 9 ranger gives automatically for free (i.e., automatic entitlement, thus enjoying high STR instead) and, yes, as ranger also get 2 more feats on top of all that as well (being more thus than what CoT would give), and which Robin uses to pick up epic feats!]. And Robin was decidedly Ranger, all versions! Only get 3 classes to play with, which leaves 2. As a melee knight proper, which is explored in this build, that is Fighter/WM classes, as explained above. (Archer's story? Ranger/AA ... see a theme here?       ). Rogue is wrong build wise and theme wise.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to PA, not something I personally want build wise; would only take PA if goin' the dev.crit route (in which case, would be required as would cleave, etc., and perhaps have some use if wielding tiny weapons PvM/E in the very early levels (but not PvP); other than that, PA and cleave are not useful at higher levels and/or when wielding ie bastard sword and double-bladed weapons, etc., not with high strength, unless going for dev.crit for which those feats are required, otherwise I don't bother, aiming for level 40 always (a build does not stop at early levels but continues on to level 40, and beyond; I like power and there are better things to choose that actually serve the whole life of the build and beyond--like, for e.g., two weapon foci fully spec'd, dual wield, etc.). And don't need more AC either. Already meets or exceeds melee standards in that department, with REAL HPs (Robin ain't no slouch, then again, he brushed off a beating by a very large man wielding a very big stick--HPs are important, and Robin's got 'em, too). Meantime, and again: with this AB/damage set up, high strength and WS/ESW, all of it tripling on a crit, (both weapons!), heh, wave bye bye to your foe. (Dexers and casters need AC, not strength based melee as dead don't strike back!).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, don't need more tumble; have mobility and spring attack. Way better than is tumble on Str based melee actually (only x-trained for benefit to AC, and don't need more). Difference b/w plate and light armor assuming dex all capped out once again --(note: plate is already on Robin capped, with only a simple +3 Dex item or Ranger scroll (Cat's) capping out light armor as it is, thus very easy to do, and regardless of magic setting)--a mere 1 ac when count dodge, which is hardly an issue (it's just not), not to mention that whirlwind is working like it should -- YAHHH! (so no need to switch out to sword+board or pull on the expert.mode either, but all such things are options, if you should want, with option to wear plate anytime you should want as well. No issue). Best defense always said is a strong offense. <br/>\n<br/>\nFrankly, if drop 2nd weapon spec, if not \"theme weaponry\", I'm going with my alternate path as I set out under level guide: namely, dual wielding Dev.Crit kurki with the 6 apr (7 apr hasted), high strength based damage with WS/EWS on both kukri, allowing for different damage/elemental enhancements as well, excellent crit.range, all that apr thus loads of crits--rather exciting damage and forcing those saves and but how v insta-death as against a Naked DC 42 (48 bio-cap), which is excellent! Also, ranger among other things and in addition to free dual automatically gives access to ranger items, i.e., scrolls (grease, which stacks with itself; cat's, aid, blade thirst, etc) and also did I mention deadly traps? So don't need no UMD either. Robin be plenty versatile already and more than enough strength for carting clarity potions (like all other melee builds), thus no issue there either (easiest thing to shore up). <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to scouting skills, they're fully trained likewise on purpose--listen is only good against move silently, whereas spot speaks to hide. There are synergies between them (and the PvM/E monsters can be sneaky, too, you know; not to mention that, when it comes to PvP, strength builds out there trying to pull a sneaky dev.crit; won't work as against Robin, who will rip them apart instead. As to the dex-based ones? KD, dev.crit. Dead Rogue). Then, Robin was a knight (as seen in this build), a strong melee proper so wouldn't expect anything less.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAh, but this build theme-wise is about Robin and the Battle Bridge, and bastard sword and dire mace are nice weapons PvM/E especially. Bastard sword (knight's weapon of choice) delivers very good, consistent damage (nice threat range, /x3 multiplier on a crit) whereas dire mace (already discussed) is a double-sided large weapon, 6 apr (7 apr haste) with all that great strength and WS/EWS both sides (tripling on a crit!) being bludgeon damage, which is effective against everything really but the sneak/crit immunes like undeads especially (and Pale masters, too, not to mention not going to be disarmed in that game either, pounding into dust anyone who even dares try it.  ).<br/>\n<br/>\nMain weakness with most WM (even more so a problem for rogues) is that they're reliant on crits in order to do damage, might as well be standing around poking undeads (and pale masters, etc.) with a twig. Not the case at all for Robin here, who carries the big stick (pun in terms of theme fully intended). With high STR, WS/EWS and the double weapon specialization, etc. permits delivery of two different damage types, slashing and bludgeon both, and which is nothing to sneeze at, especially not if you want to solo PvM/E (deadly traps are nice too). Robin be plenty versatile, and deadly-lethal in melee combat, which is important for a melee build.   <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: You didn't, did you? No, wait you did, you did say \"Prince of Thieves\"?!!?</div>"

No way to achieve what Ranger does here, not without gimping the build since no other class gets to bypass dual requirements other than ranger, there simply being no way around that. (This, without taking on (useless) DEX, wasting feats, loss of skills, etc. and might add that WMs are quite limited in terms of boni feat selection (among other things that list don't include the dual wield feats either), and strength isn't available to anyone except as a general feat in epics, so no way to make that loss up]. Going Half-Orc (which Robin decidedly wasn't) would give strength, but need to adjust for loss of INT, costing a whack of skills and also yet another feat; gutting playability beyond belief, and still not getting (as in never) to that which it is that Ranger 9 in this build achieves and for what? Then, why would anyone want to settle for anything less, when with ranger you can as this build shows have and enjoy it all!! <br/>\n<br/>\nTo put it another way, Robin had a choice. And with eyes wide open, he chose ranger in the stories, all versions. A wise and intelligent choice it was, by a wise and intelligent man who went onto become one of England's best known Heroes. Then, I've been telling you guys for years that ranger when built right is a powerful melee class--deadly effective and yet versatile as well. This build being proof positive, yet once again, that Ranger is a strong warrior (so much more to the class than just the FE path alone, as is well demonstrated here). <br/>\n<br/>\nAh, but perhaps if I had said it in an English accent. Right, then [*clears throat* (tongue-firmly-in-cheek)]:<br/>\n<br/>\nListen up, blokes. Ranger is a cracking melee class. Get dual wield for free, no need to raise (useless) Dex, thus HIGH STRENGTH, High/PG AB/damage, 6 apr (7 apr hasted) -and- REAL HPs in turn, along w. inherent versatility as well. Ranger entitles automatic access to ranger items, scrolls [including but not limited to: aid, blade thirst, cat's, grease (it stacks with itself!), freedom (immunity to paralysis, slow, entangle, and all movement speed decrease effects of every type, nature, and kind whatsoever, thus blanket immunity). A smashing skill set, including traps. Rest of the lot are a sorry bunch by comparison, no dual wield (without cutting other crucial stuff that is), no magic access of any type, nature or kind (excepting paladin) and not a single trapper among the lot such that  ranger, with free dual wield, class entitlements and traps, is a marvelous melee class, yet not to melee alone is ranger solely restricted (versatility being an inherent trait of the class).  (Oh, Prince of Thieves, indeed!   ).<br/>\n<br/>\nEven better when combine ranger with Fighter (feats, WS/EWS) and WM (SWF, crit.crazy factor) as here, making for a pure, no-nonsense H&amp;S power melee warrior in turn, loaded with combat options, and yet at the same time versatile.

I'm afraid poor Robin will be limited to either a short sword or rapier due to his \"artistic\" proclivity so cross the cleaver (i.e. bastard) off the list of alternatives.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for the build itself, I've been noticing this trend in more and more builds posted i.e. investing in Set Trap without any complimentary investment in either Disable Traps (to recover) or Craft Trap (to create kits using components).\u00a0 A non-rogue class is generally banned from shops that offer trap kits of the highest power and components (even lockpicks aren't sold outside of the black market). This theme is not at all unique.\u00a0 It's basic AD&amp;D class-specific dynamics.\u00a0 So, if your weapon master can just walk into any store and buy deadly traps, there was little consideration of actual AD&amp;D class design incorporated.</div>"
