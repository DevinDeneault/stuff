This time it's the loyal companion and friend of <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/xzar-the-necromancer-wizard-29-pale-master-10-assa-t2355554.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Xzar</a>, as can be seen from their comradely exchange, Xzar: \"Montaron, you are so aggravating!\" Monty: \"Go suck yer blade.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe intrepid, if evil, Zhents are the first companions (other than Imoen, of course) you can recruit, not far from Gorion's final resting place, though you are warned of their \"questionable\" morality before going to say hello to the pair. Travelling with them will bring some...interesting...reactions from other NPCs, mostly comedic in nature, though there really is nothing funny about a deranged necromancer and an amoral killer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/202012/10404082_77cf699f4fb24302dffdb0f73b9d0771.png\"/><br/>\n<br/>\nAs someone with very limited experience of the Assassin class, Max's guidance was invaluable here, and Monty has even passed muster with our killer-in-residence, Mick Dagger, so I feel less worried about presenting him to the Guild.

Pick Kiv and the other two bugger off, and vice versa. So they tend not to stay around for long these days, 'cause I do like Mr Shooty. Essentially, now I just recruit 'em, nick their gear, and put them on the front line when we first enter the Friendly Arm.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then there's the BG2 side quest...</div>",
