Unfortunately, druids and shifters are about as far from my areas of knowledge (such as they are) as is possible to get, but I didn't want you to feel ignored!<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it would help in pulling others' attention if you could re-post this in the Build Request sub-forum - 'cos that's what this is, after all. Oh, and do please have a look at the guidelines for requests.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and just a quick question from me - as unknowledgeable as I am - why Rakshasa? I've had a look at some of the other Druid/Shifter builds here, and they seem to focus on Risen Lord or Dragon, so I'm just interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks</div>",

For your question, Rakshasa have infinite uses of IceStorm, if you pick the the empowered spell feat and select it as a druid in your skill list when you shapechange to Rakshasa you will have infinite empowered icestorm. But except for the fact that i know this combo i don't have sufficient knowledge to build this well so thats why i requested and build to follow...</div>"
