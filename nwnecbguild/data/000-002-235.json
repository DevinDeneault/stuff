I don't have it myself yet, but I am interested in what your impression is so far. How does it compare to, say, <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>? I have heard that <em>D:OS</em> is very mod-able. To me, that's a big plus. If a game has solid multiplayer support and the tools are good enough to engage players in creating their own worlds, then a game can stick around for a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\n I never quite finished <em>DA:O</em>, though. I enjoy it and have fun when I play, but when I have time to play, it just seems that games like <em>NWN</em> have a stronger pull on me. Ironically, <em>DA:O</em> has so much to explore that it's partly the richness of the campaign that slows me down. I want to see everything, but I don't have much of an idea whether I am making overall progress.<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, the real reply to the topic query is - surprise! - <em>NWN</em>. I am still pretty regular on the WoG server, the girlfriend and I are working our way through Aielund, and I just finished another run through HotU. Never mind the zillion or so\u00a0<em>NWN</em> mods on my list to play.<br/>\n<br/>\n I also play a couple single-player superhero-themed games from time to time. <em>Freedom Force</em> (and the sequel) still has dozens of mods I have never played (as with <em>NWN</em>, many of the <em>FF</em> mods are better than the developer's campaign) and I still love that silver-age comics feel the game keeps. And, <em>Comic Book Hero: The Greatest Cape</em> is quite addictive, especially considering it's a non-animated, turn-based, strategy game.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It has also real-time combat unlike \"Divinity Original Sin\" which is similar to \"The temple of elemental evil\" but vastly more improved. Divinity Original Sin however you will find it far more easier to just get into the game and have fun, much like NwN 1.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
