But I suspect feat-starvation may push pre-epic feats into epic levels to do so.\u00a0 You'd need STR 13/min CHA 13 but I wouldn't worry about going nuts with WIS since it would be a self-buffer, not offensive caster, so probably 16 should do fine.\u00a0 You only need level 6 slots to extend Battletide, the latest of the buffs, and you'll get Greater Sanctuary to help with stealth.\u00a0 The added levels are just there for slots, buff duration and to avoid dispels.<br/>\n<br/>\n That should be enough to lay out a design. Why not try pasting something together yourself and we can help you fine-tune it?\u00a0 Don't worry about any skills but Tumble for the moment.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

But it could be better and it could be legit once you satisfy the prereqs.\u00a0 A few points...<br/>\n<br/>\n Take 8 Levels of Rog Pre-epic for a Rog8/Ftr8/Mnk4 split.\u00a0 It will net the same BAB 17 but you can get WS/EWS in epic with those 2 Ftr levels.\u00a0 You may need to forego Toughness, Luck of Heroes and/or Lightning Reflexes (pick 2 of those for the specialization), but with your high APR, specialization can really add up for a DEXer especially if it is not a cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\n Not sure how you got to STR 7 with \"Negatives: None\" but you shouldn't allow STR lower than 10 if you can help it.\u00a0 My DEXer DP clerics have begun setting their minimum STR at 14 these days because it makes so much difference dispatching flankers quickly even with the divine dmg factored in.\u00a0 At any rate, I realize you are attempting to glean extra WIS AC with WIS 16 but you can't afford to do it.\u00a0 Use Owl's WIS pots and scrolls to boost it. Expertise needs INT 13+ so you'd probably want to start with INT 12 +2 subrace = INT 14 at least.\u00a0 This is (or should be) a very highly-skilled build so you can control most situations.\u00a0 A ninja is famous for that sort of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n Disarm/ImpDisarm is an interesting choice but don't try it with a kama.\u00a0 The penalty is just too high.\u00a0 -6 AB is tough enough with unarmed strikes.<br/>\n<br/>\n You'll want Epic Dodge much earlier.\u00a0 If you want to strive for Monk 20, that's ok, but UMD 40+ is really not worth it.\u00a0 With the swap of 2 Ftr for 2 Rog, you could get ED as early as level 27.\u00a0 But if you delay Rog 10 until Lvl 30, UMD will reach 33 (32) so with a single Eagle pot pre-buff you can cast all scrolls w/o failure (dunno if your server uses hardcore scroll check or not, so if not, UMD 31 (30) is adequate to equip and use very expensive items).\u00a0 Your main dump skills with monk should be tumble, discipline and concentration (if taunt is a threat and you have enough points to do it) plus keeping pace with stealth skills and probably Listen.<br/>\n<br/>\n Your AB stat doesn't jive.<br/>\n<br/>\n Unarmed: BAB 27 + 11dex + 1WF + 2EWF + 1 prowess = 42 (that one matches) but,<br/>\n Kama: BAB 27 + 11dex + 1prowess = 39<br/>\n<br/>\n You can't take Imp TWF without both Ambidexterity and TWF.\u00a0 Not sure if you can fit all 3 feats into this build without giving up other feats.\u00a0 I'd say probably not. I see ImpExpertise as candidate for swap along with the other 3 feats I mentioned before.\u00a0\u00a0 I like the dual weapon idea, but am thinking you may need to give up monk 20 for more fighter feats in epic to focus in both weapons.\u00a0 Depends what you feel is the most important.\u00a0 If you invest into all the DW feats for the kamas, you really need to focus in both weapons.\u00a0 If you can buy/find scrolls of Flame Weapon or Darkfire, you'll probably stick with kamas until deciding a stun attempt or disarm attack is due.<br/>\n<br/>\n Haven't tried to check your saves or AC yet.\u00a0 The saves don't make sense so maybe were a typo.\u00a0 The AC will likely change with the changes I've suggested.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'll wait to find out if there are any \"hidden\" server-specific factors that may have contributed to solving any of these issues before going further.\u00a0 Work through them one at a time and you will be able to submit sample builds for requests and get recommendations that mean something to your design instincts in the future.\u00a0 Thanks for trying so hard, mate! <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
