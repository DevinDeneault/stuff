To see the original character, with links therein to other builds utilizing the class combination at the time of original posting, see: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build283123.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 83123.html</a> . To see his/her companion, the Shadow Sword (ED-ITWF/SC-5), click here: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/shadow-sword-fighter4-rogue26-cot10-itwf-ed-sc-5-t2297238.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">shadow-sword-fighter4-rogue26-cot10-itwf-ed-sc-5-t2297238.html</a> ).<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><br/>\nConcept \u2013 Paladin-Rogue of Arvoreen (Halfling Defenders): The Art of Defense</strong><br/>\nThe Paladins of Arvoreen are a Halfling Order in Tethyr, known officially as the \u201cArvoreen Marchers\u201d but also as Halfling Defenders, officially recognized by the Crown; a small but highly regarded order, Arvoreen\u2019s Marchers are respected by humans and halflings alike. <br/>\n<blockquote><div>Arvoreen is the Halfling God of War, whose portfolio includes Defense (Protection), Good, Duty (Law), and vigilance; his is a \u201cPower of stern defense and aggressive watchfulness, who is always preparing for incursions into (H)alfling lands and making ready to repulse hostile creatures at the first sign of trouble.\u201d His primary worshippers are Halfling soldiers and warriors including battle clerics and paladin-rogues, who specialize in all matters of defense.<br/>\n<br/>\nArvoreen's dogma is best captured by the phrase: \u201cThe Best Offense is a Strong Defense,\u201d and is as follows: <br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cKeep the community's burrows secure, and always be prepared for threats and attacks. Prepare an active defense, drill continuously, and leave nothing to chance. Put down danger before it even rears its head. Seek out allies, no matter how unorthodox. Those who give aid against a mutual foe are friends to be rewarded and trusted.\" Depriving your enemies of war-related materials (such as weapons of mass destruction, dark magic and the like) is not necessarily dishonorable, so long as you do not deprive civilians of the necessities of life (thereby improving the odds in combat later, keeping your own citizenry safe and secure, while opening doors to make friends of former foes later on, and not denying anyone anywhere the basic necessities, such as food and the like). <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Arvoreen Marchers adhere to this dogma in a manner befitting the Code of Heironeous (\u201cPaladin Code\u201d), another paladin order with to whose deity Arvoreen is closely allied such that, even although Arvoreen\u2019s Marchers are perhaps a bit unorthodox as compared to most, the two paladin orders share a common bond. Accordingly, Arvoreen's Defenders are protectors of halfling communities, \u201cconstructing defensive barriers, signaling systems, beacons, and traps, and reviewing defenses already in place . . . (Whereas m)any clerics organize the local militia, procure weapons for volunteers, and train every able-bodied halfling in the use of weapons and other defense strategies or at least in how to best seek safety, \u2026 Arvoreen's Marshals regularly adventure to gain magical weapons and defensive items of all kinds.\u201d <br/>\n<br/>\nArvoreen is an intermediate deity but a major Power in the Halfling Universe, being a child of (and subservient only to) Yondalla, the \u201cBlessed One.\u201d Yondalla is a major deity throughout all of Faerun for she is the Creator of the Halfling race and thus the Matriarch, Provider, and Ultimate Protector of all Halflings and their good-aligned/good-natured allies, being herself aligned closely with Corellon, Moradin, Tyr, Torm, Helm and Chanteau. Like Yondalla, Arvoreen smiles on followers who aid and protect those in need. He is likewise a LG deity, his favored weapon being \u201cAegisheart\u201d (shortsword) and his symbol that of two crossed shortswords. <br/>\n<br/>\nSource: This information is excerpted and adapted from: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn2.wikia.com/wiki/Arvoreen\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwn2.wikia.com/wiki/Arvoreen</a></div></blockquote>\n<strong>Shadow Shield,<br/>\nPaladin26, Rogue13, SD1 (ED-HiPs Paladin)</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>I.
