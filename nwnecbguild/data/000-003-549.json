I've kept all the saves at 20+, which isn't bad for a straight melee build. I haven't worked through the skills points yet, but there's plenty to cover Discipline, Tumble, UMD, cross-classed Spellcraft and a detect skill (Spot/Listen) with spares. He's also got an AB of 46, which is nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few things in particular I'd like advice on (though please feel free to come up with your own nuggets). I wonder about what to take as one of the\u00a0 pre-epic feats: Toughness, Great Fortitude, Martial Weapons Proficiency, or Heavy Armour Proficiency (though that last one would go against the concept). I'm also not sure whether that +1AB from WM 16 is better than a +2 to saves from a Rogue 13/ CoT 14/ WM 13.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, your thoughts would be appreciated on this first draft. <span style=\"color:#FF0000\">Now second draft - changes in red.</span> <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>LEONIDAS (Rogue 14/ CoT 10/ WM 16)</strong><br/>\nHuman, any non-evil<br/>\nL1-40 PvM<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Stats</strong><br/>\nSTR 17 (34)<br/>\nDEX 14<br/>\nCON 14<br/>\nWIS 8<br/>\nINT 13<br/>\nCHA 8<br/>\n<br/>\nHit Points: 424 <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">[464 if Toughness taken]</span><br/>\nAC: (naked) 22, (med armour - breastplate/ chain mail) 27, <span style=\"color:#FF0000\">with shortsword + tower shield 30, with Expertise 32/ 35</span> <span style=\"color:#FF0000\">(+1 Dodge, +4 vs AoO)</span><br/>\nSaves: Fort 26 <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">[28 if Great Fort taken]</span>, Will <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">20</span> <span style=\"color:#FF0000\">22</span>, Reflex 30 <span style=\"color:#FF0000\">(all +4 vs spells, +3 Reflex vs traps)</span><br/>\nBAB: 27<br/>\nAB: (spear) 46/ 41/ 36/ 31: <span style=\"color:#FF0000\">(shortsword) 41/ 36/ 31/ 26: (ranged) 30/ 25/ 20/ 15</span><br/>\nSneak Attack: 7d6<br/>\nSkills: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">[a little vague atm, but around 230 and around 200 for Disc, Spellcraft, Spot or Listen, Tumble and UMD]</span> <span style=\"color:#FF0000\">274.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks, Yunim. The saves would always be welcome (I really hate failing Will saves as a meleer - it stops you doing the one thing you're supposed to do - but it's an occupational hazard much of the time, which is why I tend towards CoT rather then Fighter a fair bit. And I appreciate there's no Will bump in your suggestion).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is one more downside (which probably makes more difference in modules than on PWs), though, and that's the delay of EWF by at least one level. It's one for me to mull on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd also thought about delaying the final 3 levels of CoT into epic levels and bringing the first 2 WM levels in pre-epic (taking WW Attack at level 18 and negating my quandary over which feat to take then and maybe grabbing something else as my \"floating\" CoT bonus feat in epic levels).<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi Stag<br/>\n<br/>\nDelighted to read through your build as always and learn from what you are doing!<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of nice things in your build, including taking seven great strength feats plus 7d6 sneak attack (which can be triggered by flanking with summons from UMD, or improved knockdown) with a very good 46 base AB with potentially two weapon foci and 34 strength<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly I do not think you can take Weapon Focus: Spear with Weapon Proficiency (Rogue), hence I would encourage you to go the dual foci route for your build in terms of achieving your CoT requirements then take the WF: Spear once you get CoT<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally like the idea of dual foci to wield a\u00a0xiphos (greek shortsword)\u00a0and large shield (gotta be a round shield if you are Spartan, sorry tower shields) and dropping heavy armor proficiency (I don't recall many spartans clad in heavy plate, they are meant to intimidate with their biceps), and I like the idea of blind fight in the build over toughness. I don't think you would lose a lot of AC by equipping a chain shirt then boosting dex a little with items / UMD / cats grace potions.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see Yunim's suggestion would be best for a max power level 40 build, but the extra skill dumps are better in a build which plays along its lifetime with termination near 40 (I'm thinking Aielund), losing one skill dump epic might mean 5 levels where your rogue skills are not effective enough. All depends on the environment<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of skill points I would ensure there is 4 ranks in intimidate during your rogue levels (Weapon Master Prerequisite), Tumble 40.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nBeyond that you have a lot of choices. Here are some suggestions. I'm sure you know a lot about this but I put it up there, just in case<br/>\n<br/>\nUMD: I would take this simply because it is so good, if you dont want to cast spells then use it so you can use any equipment you need to, like a brutal survivor a Spartan is, you can use those Monk Boots if needed<br/>\nDetection: Agree with either Listen or Spot, I would choose Listen if you go stealth based<br/>\nStealth: Potentially a good choice with a two handed and medium armor, with your dex score but will use up a lot of your skill points<br/>\nDiscipline: A good choice in some modules, particularly if there are opponents who use disarm / called shot. Essential if knockdown immunity is not available or difficult to obtain.<br/>\nTraps: Set trap 15 modified is handy to set all deadly traps except gas traps, disable trap is also handy to get some bonus exp or retrieve traps to use against your enemies<br/>\nSocial skills: Persuade is handy in a few modules, Appraise is also handy in environments which are cash strapped<br/>\nSpellcraft: is ok for + saves against spells, particularly if you dont want to use buffs from UMD or dont have access to them<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

But that's not Sparta!!! <br/>\nThe CEP Goad may look like a one handed spear, but you cannot take any feats in it. Another solution would be if you were able to trick the game into treating your character as one size bigger so you could wield the spear in one hand. (I don't know if it's even possible)<br/>\n-<br/>\nI found two almost identical builds with these classes in my folders. They were both Rogue 13/ CoT 8/ WM 19 with Rogue 10/ CoT 6/ WM4 pre epic, and ended up with AB +47 and a will save bonus of 19. But they were Rapier builds with Armor proficiency heavy, so no Spatra there. (So I dont even know if this is helpful) The stats were STR: 17 (34), DEX: 13, CON: 14, WIS: 8, INT: 14, CHA: 8.<br/>\nI took Crippling strike like you did, but chose Defensive roll for the second rogue feat. Slippery mind may be better and suits your attempt to avoid mind spells.<br/>\nI list the skills for comparison. With INT 14 I could pick one more skill and had room for a little extra:<br/>\nBuild 1: Appraise 13(15), Craft Trap 19(21), Disable Trap 12(16), Discipline 43(55), Intimidate 4(3), Listen 43(42), Lore 8(10), Open Lock 28(29), Persuade 13(12), Search 40(42), Set Trap 12(15), Tumble 40(41), UMD 36(35)<br/>\nBuild 2: Appraise 13(15), Craft Trap 19(21), Disable Trap 12(16), Discipline 43(55), Intimidate 4(3), Listen 43(42), Open Lock 13(14), Persuade 13(12), Search 40(42), Set Trap 12(15), Tumble 40(41), UMD 36(35), remaining skillpoints 23. <br/>\nI could have x-classed Spellcraft here for better saves vs spells.<br/>\n-<br/>\nLevelling up such a build may be a challenge early on when you have a strength based rogue with only light armor and no shield. But I guess you can write that off as \"Spartan hardship\".<br/>\n-<br/>\nOrion brought up Aielund.<br/>\nThat sparked some thoughts and questions about how such a character would have acted throughout that campaign. How would a Spartan lost in Aielund have interacted with the different NPCs? What path would it take and who would he choose to party up with? <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'll edit the OP shortly to accommodate what I can (I'll do it in red so it shouldn't be too confusing).<br/>\n<br/>\nI will be going for the two weapon foci (shortsword - as Mick says, rapier is probably the \"better\" choice, but RP must play its part, and even then a shortsword should really be both piercing and slashing, much as a greatsword should be both slashing and bludgeoning, but I digress - then spear). With the same class split, I'll still have a reasonable 41 AB with shortsword.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe skills breakdown from Mick is very helpful. First, it makes it easier for me to do the sums, which is always nice. Second, again given the RP nature of the build, I'm not really looking for trapping skills (maybe a few points in Disable), so an INT of 13 seems right in this instance, giving me an albeit teeny bump to DEX.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the \"one size bigger\" thought, I like it, but suspect it will remain just that, a nice thought (and as a side-effect it would also seriously boost IKD).<br/>\n<br/>\nMick is right that early levels will be challenging, particularly if soloing, but that should help hone my playing skills, looking on the sunny side!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the Aielund question is an interesting one, and I'll try running the build around there to see how it fares (though I don't recall seeing many quality spears there, but then I haven't been looking for them before. It's also a non-Dev Crit environment, so might suit this build). I don't see him getting on terribly well with Robert Black or Terinus, but he'd probably really like Valennia and maybe Maggie (for her passion), and have a love-hate relationship with Dante. The other henchies I'm thinking he'd have no really strong feelings about either way (so maybe no romance with Criosa).<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

In this build the player has to play pure rogue for 10 or so levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nRogue has as you recall, d6 hit die, 3/4 BAB, restricted to light armor and no shield proficiency.\u00a0<br/>\nFighter has d10 hit die, full BAB, heavy armor, shield and martial weapon proficiency, concentration/discipline as a class skill<br/>\n<br/>\nMan - o - Mano, 1v1 melee fair duel combat wise -&gt; Fighter will always have a significant advantage over Rogue.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is assuming no usage of stealth, traps, UMD, cheesy ranged kiting tricks with tumble, or using summons/companions to flank your opponent (or sneak attacks with a shortbow).<br/>\n<br/>\nI obtained a lot of advice from other players to improve my rogue gameplay.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIn summary I believe rogue has three advantages over fighters:<br/>\n- sneak attack<br/>\n- skills (8 skill points / level vs 2 skill points / level), most of them class skills, exception of discipline/concentration<br/>\n- evasion / uncanny dodge etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nCombat relevant skills are broken down into<br/>\n-&gt; stealth / detection<br/>\n-&gt; traps<br/>\n-&gt; UMD<br/>\n-&gt; tumble<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm still learning rogue stuff all the time from other players. Gkorjax for example, was kind enough to party with me the other day, and taught me the power of the humble 'wand of sleep'. Enemies with limited hit die who are asleep can be assassinated very easily with coup de grace.<br/>\n<br/>\nAC wise thankfully this build has Dex 14. I've played pure rogue builds with Dex 8 and they are awful to level.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall I think you are being somewhat harsh on judging your build which a lot of people have contributed towards to make it optimal and I would encourage you to reconsider, it might just be in the hands of a skilled rogue player those early levels one might do fine...<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example in the original campaign, if you have a suitable melee companion tank for you, you will be doing a lot of sneak damage. Level 10 rogue is 5d6 sneak damage, that is more than two greatswords in a single hit.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIf they target you, use tumble and get away from them, kite them until they retarget your companion, then sneak again. Maybe you could even use a shortbow in that situation to make it easier, although if they do get into melee range you will suffer -4 to AB, but I think if you are within 15 feet the sneak attack will activate without the AB penalty (?anyone can confirm)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

And when I do build, they tend to be more conceptual in nature, rather than optimized, and as a module rather than PW player, I appreciate playability throughout more than max level 40 power. And that's fine: we all have our stengths and weaknesses, after all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have learned to play in many contrasting styles depending on build and environment - more often than not because this lot provide so many builds I want to play. Normally, somewhere around level 10 I know if it's \"my kind of thing\" or not, but sometimes I keep ploughing on anyway because I can be a stubborn bugger (I know, scarcely believable!), and those will end up as being the most valuable ones, as I learn new ways of playing. Casters still bring me out in hives, but hey, we can't have everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI still don't think this particular beastie warrants a place in the pantheon, though.

It had a starting strength of 16-17 and dex of 8, con 16, in 14 something like that. Originally I designed it with 8 levels of rogue before the first level of blackguard, however I learned 8 levels of pure rogue, strength based, dex 8 is just too painful in light armor and no shield proficiency, the only way to win fights was with UMD. This was my first proper rogue build, and just part of the learning process called experience. It was funny, I had a chat to BlackCobra whilst playing WoG the other day, and he had a similar experience too, he had to expend extreme effort just to buff up that AC.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd thus through similar experiences we share common ground :)<br/>\n<br/>\nMick and conlaoch's comments do echo my own except with a lot more experience behind them. I only learned about the power of caltrops recently, particularly against opponents such as animals (rust monsters for example) who can't open doors! There are multiple parts of the roguish toolkit and to get the most of the class they should be utilised, otherwise any fighter/paladin build is going to be superior.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the dex 14 score, I believe that score is good for a human strength rogue that will eventually multiclass to a combat class, any higher and you are likely compromising your potential with strength, constitution or intelligence. Its nice too. Equip scale mail/chain shirt, drink a cats grace potion and/or equip a +2-4 dex item, and your AC is almost the same as wearing full plate, with a lot less encumberance and you can use tumble effectively early levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrength rogues multiclassed with combat classes (which is Stag's build) can be absolute monsters.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can equip that medium/heavy armor, tower shield even, pack a punch with a huge amount of strength damage, weapon buffs from UMD (ie flame weapon/keen weapon), defensive buffs from UMD (ie improved invisibility), deal 10d6-15d6 sneak attack (which you can trigger with invisibility/flanking from companions or summons from UMD/improved knockdown or even attacking around a corner!), carry mountains of loot, devastating critical, plus you can detect and disable all the traps, open all the locks, set deadly traps (just unequip that tower), detect every stealther approaching you with listen/spot, plus you get evasion/uncanny dodge/crippling strike/improved evasion. Tank for your party etc etc. It feels like you can do everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nStealth is a little weaker (which rogue has bonus epic skill foci in hide and move silently if you want to use this seriously as a strength rogue) and epic dodge is generally out of the equation (I believe there are some dev crit/epic dodge builds in the ECB archives but they are rare) but these are only a few parts of the overall rogue toolkit one is missing and what is gained covers so many weaknesses of the rogue class.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot only that its super fun to rogue up in a party with that keen weapon'ed greatsword equipped and start dishing out huge numbers from big sneak attacks &amp; critical hits &amp; strength damage :) Greatsword rogue! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall I think Stag build should be fine, and whilst I will always try to temper any comment with kindness, honesty and objectivity are also important to me as well. I would just treat it as part of the RP experience of the build. Suffering as a lowly spartan midget of society, and you gotta earn your space as a warrior through cunning, versatility and brutality. Perhaps princes were not excluded from the process either?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not easy being Spartan! :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.history.com/news/8-reasons-it-wasnt-easy-being-spartan\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.history.com/news/8-reasons- ... ng-spartan</a><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It's currently at F14/ R7/ WM19. The saves are pretty diabolical, and I've swapped Shortsword for Scimitar, but it's got EWF and EWS in both weapons, along with Imp Crits and 2 WoCs, giving an AB of 48 with both. It also has access to Concentration. Obviously, the number of skill points suffers, but I'm working things through as I speak (well, you know what I mean).

Warriors would use this weapon more as an axe then a sword, inflicting nasty wounds compared to the cleaner holes made by the spear and xiphos. This weapon was seen as the quintessential \"bad guys\" weapon in ancient Greece.

I actually started off with a Fighter 16/ Rogue 2/ WM 22, which allowed for a final STR of 34 because I could take both general feats used for EWF as bonus feats, freeing the pair up for Great Strength feats. If I didn't take any Rogue levels until epic levels, that would also give me +3 AB (1 GS, 1 pre-epic BAB, and 1 WM bonus feat), making 51.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it's a bit of a bastard to level-up through the ranks, and you've already complained about Tumble dumps.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also considered grabbing Epic Will as a general feat to help with the horrible Will save, which would mean lowering my final Strength back to 32 (starting with 16), but allowing for upping the starting INT to 14 and putting the WIS to 10 (meaning a Will save of 20, which is always a target for me), thus grabbing a further full skill while still having 50 AB.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould that suit you better? I can't honestly say SD, Bard, Monk, HS, or Ass seem to make more sense than Rogue here. Maybe SD for HiPS, but the stealth skills would be crappy, and I still don't see Spartans as sneakers.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlad you like the 2 WoCs.
