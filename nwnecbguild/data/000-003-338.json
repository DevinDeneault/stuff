The idea for it came up after re-reading my topic about the evil rogue/cleric/blackguard-request. While I enjoy all-out combat it's also cool to just sit back and shoot arrows or sneak around and backstab the enemy to death!<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure about race and weapon focus. I could pick human for extra stuff, or elf and give him a black skin and white hair and see him as a drow (no I will NOT install various hakpacks to get the real drow race), or have a typical elf who has a different view on life and, well, death (much like Grimgnaw). For weapons I could stick to the monk's favorite kama's, but short swords and kukri's could be funky as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it's better to play him as<br/>\n1) rogue instead of monk, but then you have your standard setup for backstabbers;<br/>\n2) rogue instead of assassin, but that feels less evil.<br/>\n3) rogue instead of shadow dancer, ditching the HiPS.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd like to ask about a build wherein I can get all three classes at lvl 10 or so, since I don't really like waiting X lvls for the first lvl of class Y to be added, like <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Monk_20/_shadowdancer_1/_assassin_19\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">THIS</a> build I found after a quick \"nwn monk/sd/assassin\" search on google.

With TWF and Ambidex the AB would be +16/+13 with the main hand and +16 off hand.<br/>\nYour AB will be +18/+15 if you switch to a single kama. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe build is meant to start dual wielding at level 15 when you have both TWF and Ambidex. It is possible to start taking the two weapon fighting feats earlier if you delay WF Kama. Then you can have TWF at level 9 and Ambidex at level 12.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom your reports I understand that the character works well after all, I guess that either demonstrates how easy the OC is or how powerful an assassin with HIPS is.  </div></blockquote>\nStarted dualwielding them kama's at lvl 5 or so, lol. I am currently lvl 12 (close to 13, just started chapter 3) and enjoying the rapid attacks I do in this order:<br/>\n1. Sneak (duh)<br/>\n2. Enable Flurry of Blows<br/>\n3. Attack<br/>\n<br/>\nTriple Death Attack in 1 round. Rinse and repeat if need be <br/>\n<br/>\nAttacks are mainhand +18/+15+12 and  offhand +14, not too shabby for duelwielding before you say it's viable<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

In a more challenging environment, you'll be facing mid 20 ACs at that point AT LEAST. I know you aren't playing anywhere else, but we're just telling you that you shouldn't use the OC as a basis to decide ANYTHING if you ever play that build again anywhere else.

He did a lot of cow killing before he dared solo the south road in act 1. After he got to level 3 and got his first hit of Monk speed, he survived as a \"run n gun\" archer, until the hitpoints and new found equipment allowed him to be more active in melee. He grew gradually stronger compared with what he was up against, but even so the first SD level with HIPS was a turning point.

How did i thought that thing difficult?<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember way back into 2005 at the original boards of Bioware, people complaining about that Balor in last act. \" I can't hurt it! Please help!! \" And the fun was that the game was offering +3 weapon in abudance actually..<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's all a matter of experiance, you can't become better at chess if you keep facing the same low skill opponents. You have to get beaten by a better player and start thinking, why you lost.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you find a way to overcome this and next time you will be better without even realizing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing that i am sure made this more difficult i actually the bad A.I of your henchmen. This won't happen with Tony's A.I as Linu will buff to heavens and will be very formidable all by herself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you haven't already installed that thing, i advice you to do it as soon as possible, it makes the whole NwN a lot better. Skills start to matter, henchmen actually think, it's a whole new level of experiance.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Klauth, it is actually indented to be tough, you know in FR this dragon is actually a major player in the epics. What do you do when you face a major battle? Preparations are the answer, buff as if there is no tomorrow!<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will find this, to be the answer in many tough situations, alongside with proper tactics of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am glad you move through  the campaign with speed though, seems you have a blast with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs always keep us informed!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Dunno if it was a glitch, but Klauth just stood there where Linu had died and I had all the time to kill him, heh.<br/>\n<br/>\nI rushed through the warzone of chapter 4, used the same tactic against the dragon/balor, killed Aribeth and Maugrim and am now inside the Source Stone. Alone. Because fuck yeah sneaking! The only thing I just can't beat are the two guardian dragons, lol. Everytime I try something, Linu gets feared, bear gets dispelled and I get knocked down.
