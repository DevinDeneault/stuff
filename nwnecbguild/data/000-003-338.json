      "content": "<div>So, I was planning on running through the Aielund Saga (again), and while I normally focus more on roleplay in a build than powergaming, I thought this combo had potential enough to sufficiently be both. I have most of the levels planned out: 10 in RDD per usual, 9 in Sorcerer for Stoneskin, and the rest in Monk. The plan was for him to buff himself with Stoneskin and other minor spells, then run in and melee with that nicely boosted Strength. I could still use some help organizing the stats and picking out feats, so any help would be appreciated.</div>"
