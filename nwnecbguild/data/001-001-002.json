      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">So recently I have been playing my imported character from Lord of Terror module into Sands of Fate. I have arived to the point when I exposed Merchant Guildmaster and killed him. After killing him I went stairs down and killed guards.. then went lower level and killed guards but not merchants - they were neutral towards me. I then went into stables and for some reason Ox'es in the pen were hostile and my henchman killed them (not sure why Ox'es were hostile..). I made stupid mistake and quicksaved only to discover that entire town is hostile towards me..<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like to fix it with console command. But I had no luck, im not sure what to type.<br/>\nI guess its dm_setfactionreputation &lt;faction1&gt; &lt;faction2&gt; &lt;x&gt; command. But Im lost what to really type there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help would be nice!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
