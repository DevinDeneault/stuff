Turns out you can, but my results so far have been pretty ugly - the AC and saves make for particularly grim reading. It could be that going for a STR build rather than a DEX one was my first dumb idea. Maybe a DEX/CON tank would have been a better way forward. Or maybe I'm just looking for too much in a feat-starved build (no bonus feats at all - I'm not counting FEs, as they're kind of necessary for Bane to work). Oh, and SD is used rather than Rogue because I don't like xp penalties. And yes, I sacrificed Ranger spells, perhaps misguidedly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice would be welcome - including \"Bin it, it'll never fly\".<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this is where I currently am...<br/>\n<br/>\nRANGER 22/ BARBARIAN 16/ SD 2<br/>\nHuman, non-lawful<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR 16 (28)<br/>\nDEX 13<br/>\nCON 16<br/>\nWIS 8<br/>\nINT 13<br/>\nCHA 8<br/>\n<br/>\n1 B1 - Expertise/ WF: Hand-axe/ (Rage1/ Barb Speed)<br/>\n2 R1 - (Dual-Wield/ FE I/ Trackless Step)<br/>\n3 R2 - Dodge<br/>\n4 R3 - STR+1 (17)<br/>\n5 R4<br/>\n6 R5 - KD/ (FE II)<br/>\n7 R6 - (Animal Companion)<br/>\n8 R7 - STR+1 (18)<br/>\n9 R8 - Blind Fight<br/>\n10 R9 - (ITWF)<br/>\n11 B2 - (UD I)<br/>\n12 B3 - IKD/ STR+1 (19)<br/>\n13 B4 - (Rage2)<br/>\n14 B5<br/>\n15 R10 - ICrit/ (FE III)<br/>\n16 R11 - STR+1 (20)<br/>\n17 R12<br/>\n18 R13 - Mobility<br/>\n19 R14<br/>\n20 R15 - STR+1 (21)/ (FE IV)<br/>\n21 R16 - EWF: Hand-axe<br/>\n22 SD1 - (HiPS)<br/>\n23 R17<br/>\n24 R18 - STR+1 (22)/ ASkin<br/>\n25 R19<br/>\n26 R20 - (FE V)<br/>\n27 R21 - BoE <br/>\n28 B6 - STR+1 (23)<br/>\n29 B7<br/>\n30 B8 - GStr I (24)<br/>\n31 B9<br/>\n32 B10 - STR+1 (25)<br/>\n33 B11 - GStr II (26)/ (DR 1/-)<br/>\n34 B12<br/>\n35 B13<br/>\n36 B14 - STR+1 (27)/ Epic Prowess/ DR 2/-)<br/>\n37 SD2<br/>\n38 R22<br/>\n39 B15 - Terrifying Rage/ (GRage4)<br/>\n40 B16 - STR+1 (28)/ (GRage5)<br/>\n<br/>\nHPs - 548<br/>\nAC - 21 (naked)<br/>\nSaves - F 26/ W 15/ R 17<br/>\nBAB - 30<br/>\nAB (melee) - (max) 43/ (D-W) 41<br/>\nSkill points - 262.

I was coming to a similar conclusion, and was about to embark on a first draft when I took a look here first. Clearly, I'd have to get Finesse in there somewhere, so I expect either Expertise or IKD would have to go. I'm also considering dropping the final level of Barb for another one of Ranger. It's balancing the loss of 1 Greater Rage with gaining 1 more Favoured Enemy, but given Terrifying Rage comes so late it might be worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for giving it a look, though!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Without UMD for scrolls of lesser mind blank / mind blank, mind affecting spells and abilities would be quite effective against this build. one will either be reliant on an item to manage this (such as the lesser belt of guiding light, or the fabled golden circlet) or clarities. In environments where such items exist the will save is less of an issue and in a party situation this won't matter if a mage can buff you up<br/>\nGoing dex would free up a lot more starting stat points and help with stealth skills, whether or not it is optimal I do not know<br/>\nI have a few suggestions, purely based on personal preferences, and are minor tweaks at most, and one must note both ranger and barbarian are my least played classes, an ending base AB of 43 (41 dual wielding) should be more than satisfactory to do what is needed, along with improved knockdown and blind fight\u00a0<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>This is what it might look like with half-orc, strength based, with wis 14 for ranger spells like camoflage.

The opening stats I worked from were STR 18 (30), DEX 14, CON 14, WIS 8, INT 13, CHA 6. The AB was the same as yours, Orion, but obviously no spells. The reason I pumped CON (as in the OP) was mostly for the duration of raging (CON modifier + 7 rounds + 2 more rounds in greater rage).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest problems I had were 1. Skills - as you mention in your build, and 2. Even greater feat-starvation. You got around that by using Ranger bonus feats for EWF and EP, as well as losing Imp Crit.

Actually, dual-wielding might not be so bad, even in a STR build. BoE will put your damage really high. HiPS will assure that you always get attacks on flat-footed if you time it right. I would try to get better WISDOM. There are som nice spells in there. I might check out this build a little, see what an old-timer ranger can get out of it. It appeals to me!<br/>\n<br/>\nSent fra min SM-G950F via Tapatalk<br/>\n<br/>\n<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
