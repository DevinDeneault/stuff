Enchant Arrow V gives a +5 enchantment, piercing stoneskins and premonition, which makes it a very quick mage-killer. The AB is quite good despite the modest dexterity, and can be buffed further.<br/>\nThe saves are very good.<br/>\nThe character has stealth for tactical positioning and can spot hiding creatures.<br/>\nBards can use all arcane scrolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeaknesses:<br/>\nThe AC is only medium and the hitpoints are low. The character is fragile early in its career. The Ghostly visage spell will help with survival once you get it. You can summon animals that can serve as meat-shields through your early levels. Don't be afraid to use scrolls and potions.<br/>\n<br/>\nItems:<br/>\nYou want items to help cap charisma at 34 (+12 froms items and eagle's splendor).<br/>\nYou want mighty bows to benefit from your stacking strength buffs.<br/>\n<br/>\nTweaks:<br/>\nSome may prefer to take the Listen skill instead of Spot. Amplify will give a nice boost to Listen. Clairaudience/clairvoyance will boost both Listen and Spot<br/>\nEdit 1: It is possible to take BG earlier and get Divine Might at level 12 or 15. To do that you have to delay Blind Fight and/or Rapid shot. The Enchant Arrow progression will also be temporarily stalled at EA I or II.<br/>\nEdit 2: Called Shot and Improved Critical Longbow are alternatives to Blind Fight. Called Shot will help making soloing a bit easier since you can use it to effectively slow down your target. Improved Critical makes you crit more often for more heavy damage. Blind Fight helps you hit concealed creatures and helps when blinded, in darkness or when fighting invisible creatures.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">You're right.\u00a0 It is somewhat difficult to follow but no worries.\u00a0 Let's work it through step-by-step...<br/>\n<br/>\n First off, I'm assuming this is not Arelith since your plan is apparently in conflict with the 3-class minimum by shrugging off BG3 at Level 18.\u00a0 I think that would be a mistake even with the Divine Shield helmet.\u00a0 Keep in mind that the main impetus of the build lies on DAMAGE, not AC, nor AB.\u00a0 So, though more AC would certainly be a benefit, those precious Turn Undead attempts would be drained by using the shield instead of the might.\u00a0 Divine Shield would be a luxury more than an optimization in this case.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n I see a lot of value in ImpCrit because, as is typical for AA's exalted AB, you'll be hitting a lot and the threat roll will almost certainly produce many opportunities for crits except against PMs and Shifter Undead shapes, of course.\u00a0 A level 8 Curse Song would be mostly defensive (Bard 9 is the same song as Bard 8) and would force your toon into closer range (i.e. melee) in order to implement its benefit... which is fine for a PBS attack, but be advised that one of the key advantages of an AA is to eliminate all the counter attacks by pulling adversaries as your toon displaces.<br/>\n<br/>\n However, I am thinking Called Leg shots would perhaps be an even better fit for PvP unless the server has made a feat customization to prevent the 20% movement penalty or the arm's AB reduction vs. PCs.\u00a0 It would also fall into the same category with the crit advantages in that the AA is one class that has enough of an AB to absorb the feat's attack penalty like a WM would have, perhaps even more so.<br/>\n<br/>\n Understand that any recommendation I offer evolves from the way I play all my AAs, predominantly artillery using summons to temporarily deflect and buy some time for more unabated hits.\u00a0 For a PBS style, a different strategy applies since you'd need to play more defensively with the constant threat of opposed counter-attacks looming around you.\u00a0 That's where the Divine Shield would come into play (and Curse Song to a lesser degree).<br/>\n<br/>\n So, in brief, in order to glean a last tumble dump, you could reach (again, assuming you didn't avoid the BG3 Divine Might during pre-epic) is Brd9/BG3/AA18 for the +9 enchantment and bonus feat at AA18.\u00a0 You'll get 2 AA bonus feats, one at AA14 and the other AA18.\u00a0 At both I'd take Great DEX.\u00a0 The DCs of the special attacks like imbue, are based on the DEX modifier so you can never have too much. Ability bumps at Lvl 24/28 I would go with CHA.\u00a0 That leaves 4 general feats to allocate.\u00a0 EWF should be automatic.\u00a0 That leaves 3.\u00a0 My own preference for a confirmed stealth bomber would be ESkF: Hide and ESkF: MvSil to thwart your epic listener and spotter PCs.\u00a0 That leaves 1 general.\u00a0 I am inclined towards Called Shot for the reasons already expressed but ImpCrit would be a close 2nd if you are uncomfortable with using leg and arm shots in the heat of battle.\u00a0 An AA is hardly pressured to take Epic Prowess with its intrinsic nasty AB.\u00a0 EWF should be more than enough to hit everything in sight (and even those around corners with seekers).\u00a0\u00a0 Just figuring roughly off of Mick's pre-epic build, the final AB should be 44 without prowess.\u00a0 That's a respectable AB even for a Level 40 toon and should be plenty for your Level 30 environs.<br/>\n<br/>\n IMO the d6 sneak damage is not worth investing into.\u00a0 Unless you decide to morph this into a PBS Taunt build, another level of BG serves no purpose.\u00a0 Bard can dump to Discipline should you decide to go that route (again only a value with a PBS tactic), which is not currently part of Mick's original plan anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n Hopefully, I haven't confused the issue more than before the reply.\u00a0 Where's Mick when you need him to translate and capsulize?\u00a0<img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" />\u00a0 This Level 30 discussion should have been posted in the Request forum but I have no way to separate out the replies into a new topic therein.\u00a0 Your indulgence would be appreciated unitl the issue is consummated.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

In this case, I'd take the Epic Prowess for the one AA bonus instead of Grt DEX since you'll miss out on the matching DEX boost without the AA18 bonus.<br/>\n<br/>\n The only real problem with going more bard is that all your spell buffs will be easily dispelled so am not confident in how much PvP benefit can be gleaned when facing mages who will certainly dispel as soon as your toon comes within perception range (and they will also be buffed with True Seeing so your stealth will be useless vs. those types).<br/>\n<br/>\n Brd9/BG3/AA18 is probably as optimal as you are going to get IMHO.\u00a0 Just hope that your first shot does enough damage to break their concentration before being Time-stopped, Bigby'd or mind-controlled by a high mage.\u00a0 Mick's design does about the best one can expect to increase your chances to do exactly that.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

But that is taxing on your stealth skills and makes spell casting difficult. I choose chain shirt/ scale mail or lighter armor depending on how high dexterity I can get with items and buffs. <br/>\nFor comparison the AC gain in mundane full plate is 9 (8 from the armor itself and 1 from dexterity). The armor check penalty is -8 to stealth skills. The arcane spell failure is 45%.<br/>\nA chain shirt can give 8 AC, 4 from the armor itself and 4 from dexterity. You need to buff dexterity to 18 for that with a +2 dexterity item or by casting cat's grace on yourself. The armor check penalty is only -2 and arcane spell failure is now 20 %.<br/>\nIf you can buff your dexterity to 22, you will also get 8 AC from leather armor, 2 from the armor itself and 6 from dexterity. You no longer have any armor check penalty, and arcane spell failure is reduced to 10%.<br/>\nIf you buff dexterity to 26, you will get 9 AC from padded armor, 1 from the armor itself and 8 from dexterity. The arcane spell failure is now only 5%.<br/>\nIf you cap dexterity, you get dexterity 28. If you wear robes or other clothing, your dexterity AC is 9. There is no longer any arcane spell failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen downgrading the armor to lighter types, you also reduce the risk of becoming encumbered. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see there are several benefits from downgrading to lighter armor types with higher dexterity. The downside is that you don't have access to uncanny dodge with this build, so you will lose the dexterity based AC when flat-footed and when flanked.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast, but not least: Another important factor is what magical properties that are available on the different armors where you play. If there is a super \"must-have\" armor, you probably pick that one.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'm planning to run this build through the Miller mods (shadowlords, etc.) but would like to keep playing him after I'm done with those. This seems right up my playstyle alley and I'd like to explore it further without being left to my own devices, which inevitably cock everything up when it comes to building/leveling.\u00a0<img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Haha<br/>\n<br/>\nI love the build concept, iam playing on a pvp/rp faction server, nothing is changed except the lvl max is 24, (not high magic serveur, would say +5 max and only with a lot of crafting).<br/>\n<br/>\nHow would push your build to lvl 24 ?\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
