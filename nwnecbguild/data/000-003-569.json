Ranger/Druid/Assassin.<br/>\n<br/>\nThinking of about Ranger 5/Druid 18/Assassin 17.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould like to get 18 levels of Assassin but just not enough levels. I need 18 levels of Druid to take dragon form at 30th to 33rd levels, dont need more then 5 ranger levels to qualify for Assassin. 6th lev Ranger is meaningless because 6th level ranger gets a redundant animal companion that Druid gets at level 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould go Ranger 4/Druid 18/Assassin 18, and just use 1,2,3 levels of druid to cross class points into hide, move silently, to qualify for Assassin.<br/>\n<br/>\nB.Dragon Man Druid:<br/>\n<br/>\nBard 4/6/Druid 18/RDD 16/18<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea is to use Bard to qualify for RDD, and lev 2 Bard buff spells to go with Druid buffs to make character that has half dragon like abilities that can be used with all druidic forms, and will give each form better AC, Strength.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe build will reach its conclusion when it can not only turn into a dragon at 30th to 33rd level but then use RDD, Bard, Druid Spells to buff the dragon up more with higher AC, Str, Breath Weapon, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nC. Cleric/Druid/Shifter<br/>\n<br/>\nStr Domain, Magic Domain Cleric 5th level(Divine Power at 3rd level spells, due to str domain/Druid 17/18/Shifter 17/18<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea is to use Divine Power, Divine Favor, and the Cleric Magic Domain, and druid buffs to buff the heck out of the druid shifter, animal companion forms, and dragon form when get to 30th to 33rd level.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo which of these 3 druid builds should I build, and please help me build these builds with advice, what I should do at each level, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not asking to build it all for me. But the help will, would help me to then customize, tweak build help to make it my build.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn doing so i would probably accept, use, do, etc, some to most to almost almost all help.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that said I might disagree, and not use a little help.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut whether I use given help or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am listening, carefully considering, thinking about, etc, all help given.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I appreciate any, all help given.<br/>\n<br/>\nI say this so that no one gets offended, feels like their advice is wasted, not appreciated, listened to, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the help, and all the help that has been given in past.<br/>\n<br/>\nAsturonethoriusaline<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Non PW, offline solo, single player Raines WOG, Aielund, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah Assassin is semi nerfed, but can still paralyze with it, and it still works great.<br/>\n<br/>\nPicture this. Sneak up to target in 1 of the better forms, paralyze target, either let your animals kill it, or kill it yourself. If in a group. Paralyze it, kill it, let animals engage others, while you temp run away enough distance to hide, come back, paralyze kill another, rinse, repeat.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Dragon Shape, you need: 18th level+ Druid: Druid has to have Wild Shape 6, which get at Druid 18, or greater wild shape 4, which get at Shifter 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have to be 21+ epic to take Dragon Shape, and soonest that can take Dragon Shape is about 27,28,29,30 depending on build.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd these 3 builds would take it about levels 30 to 33.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to dispelling buffs. Yes cleric, bard buffs will get dispelled somewhere between epic 20th to 40th level.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut until then those buffs combined with Druid Buffs(not dispellable until about 35th to 37th level+, because 18 druid levels), turn a transformed Druid into a freak.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso not everything dispells, altho a lot of bad guy spellcasters do dispell.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to Druid/Shifter Splits: Druid 18 to 20/Shifter 16 to 18 is optimal for taking Dragon Shape about level 29, 30.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that from making a Monk 6/Druid 18 to 20/Shifter 16 to 18<br/>\n<br/>\nIf dont focus on dragon shape, then can go with Epic Shifter until u get your first bonus feat for epic shifter, at about 13th,14th level, and use the extra 2,3,4,5,6 levels and tack them onto Druid levels for about a level 20 to level 24 druid.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that means not taking dragon shape until 33rd to 36th level.<br/>\n<br/>\nA level 24 druid wont have its spell buffs dispelled until 40th level tho.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as far as the cleric, Bard buffs getting dispelled at levels 18+, your only taking the 6 bard levels to qualify for RDD, Bard Song, Level 2,3 buff spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleric gives you not only the buffs, but lets you walk around in better armor, when not transformed, and expands what weapons can use.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Ranger/Druid/Assassin has to be at Ranger 4/Druid 18/Assassin 18 because:<br/>\n<br/>\nNeed minimum 4 ranger levels to help qualify for Assassin.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeed a absolute minimum of 18 levels of Assassin. You get 2 bonus feats at Epic Assassin level 18. And anything less then 18, and your DC will be crap. I know thst at level 18, your DC is not as good as it should be according to Mik Dagger Assassin King, and he is right, but 18 is as high as can get in this build, and whatever the Assassin is not able to do, the character can easily find another way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Druid has to be at least 18 levels, and would be level 20/20 split between Druid/Assassin, if could use Druid to qualify for Assassin, instead of 4 levels of Ranger.<br/>\n<br/>\nThats about it. Hope that helps you, others help, give advice, participate, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Also I just thought of scrapping the shifter levels of the cleric/druid\\Shifter build.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat would put the build at Cleric 16/Druid 24. The Cleric Buffs would be harder to dispel, and would get Harm, Blade Barrier.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would be the optimal split between Cleric/Druid? Is Cleric 16/Druid 24 good like it seems.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso strength build or Dex build?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that if went with<br/>\n<br/>\nStrength 10<br/>\n<br/>\nDex 18<br/>\n<br/>\nCon 10<br/>\n<br/>\nInt 14<br/>\n<br/>\nWis 16<br/>\n<br/>\nCha 8<br/>\n<br/>\nThat should be able to get wisdom to 19,20 for 8th level cleric spells, and 9th level druid spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd should be able to get about a 24 to 26 to 28 dex in non transformed, and almost irrelevant while transformed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only prob with a dex build is not being able to use the better Armor that a cleric gives you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the prob with strength is that strength is just going to be replaced by transformation, and buffs anyways.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe<br/>\n<br/>\nStrength 10/12/14(for +1, +2 to hit while not transformed<br/>\n<br/>\nDex 13/14/16(For Expertise etc, and for ranged/Med Armor<br/>\n<br/>\nCon 12/14/16<br/>\n<br/>\nInt 14/16<br/>\n<br/>\nWis 15/16/17<br/>\n<br/>\nCha 8/10/12<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what would be the optimal stats here if dont go dex build??<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
