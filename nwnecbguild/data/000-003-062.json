      "content": "<div>I had so much fun creating that last build here that I decided to come back for one more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is an old concept I always wanted to find a build for way back in the day but could never find anything that seemed right.<br/>\n<br/>\nArelith rules and limitations apply.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I want to build is an unarmored STR bare fist Monk that looks and plays like a Monk. The levels don't have to be mostly monk (Although glowing eyes would be super cool looking). He/she just needs to play like one. I'd also like to know the strengths and weaknesses of going STR instead of DEX or Bare Fists instead of Kamas.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't have many ideas for what classes could work for this build. Seems that fighter is a must for some extra bare fist focus. Maybe some weapon master (Do bare fists count as a weapon?)??? Oh, and sneak attack might work wonders for a monk. I don't really know. I had a build a few years back that I never really got very far with which was Monk/Fighter/Shadow Dancer but for some reason it seems like you could get more from something else. I'm very much a layman with respect to this though so I could be completely wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny help with this concept would be greatly appreciated.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Unarmed does not count as a weapon for Weapon Master or Champion of Torm.<br/>\nA STR-based monk will do more damage, but will get hit more often because his AC will be low, so most of the time, DEX-based is better. In a low-magic environment, an unarmed monk will do more damage, but when you get into a higher-magic environment, a dual-kama monk will do more damage. A dual-kama monk has to spend 3 feats on dual wielding, but an unarmed monk has to take at least 16 levels of Monk to get the d20 damage and has to devote his gloves slot to his \"weapon\" and not other goodies like bracers of dexterity. Since I understand that Arelith is a relatively low-magic world, an unarmed DEX-based monk might be best.<br/>\nHow about a Monk 17 / Fighter 8 / Shadowdancer 5 with Epic Dodge? The Shadowdancer levels would be there not for the HiPS but for the Defensive Roll which is needed to qualify for Epic Dodge.<br/>\nIf you want sneak attack damage, how about a dual-kama Monk 10 / Fighter 10 / Rogue 10, also with Epic Dodge?</div>",

He basically made the enemy have to roll 6 saves vs paralysis at the beginning of each fight, 3 for Stunning Fists and 3 for Death Attack. The catch here is that it was a lvl 40 build, so it needs tweaking.

      "content": "<div>The Shadowdancer levels are there to get Defensive Roll in 5 levels instead of the 10 levels of Rogue that would be required. While regrettable, the loss of HiPS is not a deal breaker. With a decent AC and Epic Dodge, this build can wade into combat with fists swinging, and forget about stealth. You could go with Monk 16 / Fighter 4 / Rogue 10, but you would lose 1 Monk AC, invulnerability to mental effects, and those cool glowing eyes, and you would get an experience penalty, and you would have to choose between your 6th attack per round or Epic Weapon Spec because you can't have both.<br/>\n<br/>\nCompared to a Monk 10 / Fighter 10 / Rogue 10, a Monk 9 / Fighter 8 / Rogue 13 would lose 1 Monk AC, and trade a Fighter feat for a Rogue feat and more skill points. The Monk 10 / Fighter 4 / Rogue 16 would have an experience penalty and it would trade 3 Fighter feats for 2 Rogue feats and more skill points. Also, that build would either lose Epic Weapon Spec or lose 1 attack per round.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep in mind that all of these builds would not have a good warrior's AB. For better AB, you could drop Epic Dodge and make a dual-kama Monk 10 / Fighter 20, or Monk 10 / Fighter 10 / CoT 10. Either of these would gain you 2 AB, or you could gain a 3rd AB if you wait until epic levels for Knockdown / IKD, in which case you might consider taking 4 less Monk and 4 more Fighter.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn answer to the question you asked while I was typing, an unarmed monk would require at least 16 levels of Monk to get the d20 damage, which would leave fewer levels for Fighter and Rogue. Also, dual-wielding kamas would give you 2 more attacks per round, which would mean more sneak attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never tried Assassin, so I wouldn't be the best one to ask about that.</div>",

I love the idea of a ninja like build and i love the idea of putting some assassin in there for RP reasons but i'm not sure i'm sold on it for mechanical reasons. Because i'd like to understand it a little more I'm going to start with a M/F/As build. If I decide I don't like it i'll probably move on to a M/F/Ro build. If that happens at least there will be two builds in here.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thinking here with this build is that i get knockdown as soon as possible because, really, i can't live long without it. Those 6 levels of fighter are to squeeze out as much damage from fists as possible. I took 13 levels in assassin to get those death attacks because, well, it really sounds cool. Sneak attack with the added bonus of paralyze? Yes please. Almost tempted to go rogue instead of fighter to stack death attack with sneak attack. But i'll try not to get distracted that for now.

      "content": "<div>Hey man!<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the main problem is that Assassin levels are the MAIN COMPONENT for a high Death Attack DC (DC stands for Difficulty Class, which is the number that is the opposed roll of the saving throw vs paralysis). So, basically, this way you're ruining the concept of the build. You need to decide what's more important to you: doing more damage with your fists or having a chance of paralyzing your opponent. If it's the first, I'd remove Assassin from the build entirely, as its main class feature, the Death Attack, is rendered useless with only 7 levels. Otherwise try to fit in AT THE VERY LEAST 18 levels of the class in this build. I'm thinking Monk 6 Fighter 6 Assassin 18. <br/>\n<br/>\nEmpyre's intention was the best possible when he gave you the advice, but as he himself stated, he's not an expert in Assassins. Assassin is one of those classes that needs many levels to be effective in a build. If you aren't doing that, best not to use the class, cuz your DC as is is 9 (which is TERRIBLE). <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

Assassin has the same class skills as rogue, except persuade and parry. <br/>\n2) You may also want to use assassin to get uncanny dodge in a dexterity build. Dexterity based bards, monks, rangers, fighters, arcane archers and clerics have no access to uncanny dodge unless they multiclass with a class that gets it as class feat. <br/>\n3) The spell like abilities is another good reason to take assassin levels. 9 levels is an important target for the powerful improved invisibility spell like ability.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor further reading: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/the-cold-blooded-killer-an-assassin-guide-t2338372.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The cold-blooded killer: An assassin guide</a></div>",

      "content": "<div>Based on what they just said, I recommend you go for dual kamas instead of unarmed. Then you wouldn't need 16 levels of Monk. 6 Monk / 6 Fighter / 18 Assassin would fit the bill.<br/>\nAlternatively, you could remain unarmed by reluctantly dropping Assassin and going back to the Fighter / Monk or Fighter / Monk / Shadowdancer builds discussed earlier in this thread. Uncanny Dodge, which Mick Dagger just mentioned, is very nice to have, and you get it from Shadowdancer, as well as the Defensive Roll required to qualify for Epic Dodge, making Shadowdancer nice to have in the build even without HiPS.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>EDIT:</strong> Also, that build once again has one fewer attacks because of a too-low BAB (Base Attack Bonus). Let me explain why. Both Monk and Assassin are 3/4 BAB classes, which means that they get a +1 BAB on 3 out of 4 pre-epic levels, as opposed to Fighter, which gets +1 BAB every pre-epic level, or Wizard, which is a 1/2 BAB class. It is the 1st level in each set of 4 that doesn't get +1 BAB, so there is no +1 BAB on the 1st, 5th, 9th, 13th, or 17th levels of Monk or Assassin. So, 10 levels of Monk give you 7 BAB, 5 levels of Assassin give you 3 BAB, and 5 levels of Fighter give you 5 BAB, which add up to 15. To get that last attack per round, you need at least 16 BAB at level 20. To fix this, you would move the 5th level of Assassin, which gets no +1 BAB, into epics and move the 11th level of Monk into pre-epic, where it will get +1 BAB, bringing the total to 16 BAB at level 20. In epic levels, you get +1 BAB every other level no matter what classes you take.</div>",

There is some method to it as it is but there is still so much I don't know or understand. Even though it would make for a better build during epic levels with one more BAB, I'm not sure i could live without knockdown for that long. That fact alone is making me want to ditch assassin altogether.

      "content": "<div>The only way to get that last attack with this build is to move Fighter 6 to pre-epic, which would cost you Epic Weapon Spec: not worth it. Even as-is, this build gets more attacks per round than any non-Monk build can get.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's a suggested tweak: take Luck of Heroes at level 1, Ambidexterity at level 8, and Iron Will at level 9. This drops Power Attack and Great Cleave to boost your saves, and gives you Two Weapon Fighting before Ambidexterity, which I think is better. I recommend fighting unarmed until you get Improved Two Weapon Fighting, unless you get some real killer kamas before that.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother idea would be to replace Power Attack and Great Cleave with Skill Focus: Hide and Skill Focus: Move Silently, and maybe work in Stealthy as well. Yet another idea is to replace those feats with Dodge and Mobility.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt level 24, if you find yourself getting hit a lot, take Armor Skin, but if you find yourself missing a lot, take Epic Prowess. Either way, take the other one at level 27.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, the skills: Tumble grants you +1 AC for every 5 actual ranks, ignoring any bonus from Dexterity or items, and also, your Tumble roll to avoid an attack of opportunity while running in combat will succeed if your modified score is 15, so stop at 30 Tumble. On the other hand, UMD gives you access to the next tier of magic equipment for every 5 levels of modified UMD, including Charisma and items, so you need UMD 31(30).</div>",

Unless you plan on attacking from stealth with the fists and then switch to Kamas once the target is paralyzed. Improved Critical is also not that necessary because Kamas have a bad threat range anyway, so you'll only gain 5% chance to crit (from 5% to 10%) and there are lots of creatures that are immune to them. You can remove both these feats for Disarm / Improved Disarm to have another weapon in your \"rendering your enemy helpless arsenal\" (although your weapons are small, so it's not as effective as with a 2-hander) or you can remove just one of them and use Called Shot. Why Called Shot? Because Called Shot is cumulative, so with Monk Attack Progression and 2-weapon fighting, you can severely cripple your enemy's AC with Called Shot Leg or his AB with Called Shot Arm.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"
