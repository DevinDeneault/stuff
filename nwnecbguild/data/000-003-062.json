They all fall short regarding sinergy. This is the first one I've made that somewhat makes sense and I just discovered a very similar legacy build, the Divine Warrior. Oh well, guess I'm not winning any originality awards anytime soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n Either way, here it goes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Character concept:</strong> \"Talk softly and carry a big sword\". This character enphatises using diplomacy (persuade) and talking things out before resorting to violence, however he makes sure that if things come to blows, he will be the last man standing.\u00a0 This translates into a CHA-based melee paladin/CoT.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>What this build is about:</strong> Using CHA bonuses to fuel Divine Might, divine Shiled and Smite/GReat Smite. It also has access to some paladin spells to add flavor and have some disposable buffs if needed. They idead was a melee build that gives the player something else to do than clicking on which thing you want to kill and watch the screen for the next rounds. so it has knockdown on top of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Breakdown:</strong><br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\n<br/>\n RACE: Human<br/>\n<br/>\n ALIGNMENT: Lawful Good<br/>\n<br/>\n PLAYABILITY: 1-40 (untested)<br/>\n<br/>\n STATS:<br/>\n<br/>\n STR - 14<br/>\n DEX - 10<br/>\n CON - 14<br/>\n WIS - 14<br/>\n INT - 10<br/>\n CHA - 15 (32)<br/>\n<br/>\n All stats increases go to CHA.<br/>\n<br/>\n LEVELING GUIDE:<br/>\n<br/>\n 1- Fighter (Power Attack, Cleave, Weapon Focus: Longsword)<br/>\n 2- Paladin {Divine Grace, Divine Health, Lay on Hands}<br/>\n 3- Paladin {Aura of Courage, Smite Evil} (Extra Smiting)<br/>\n 4- Fighter (Blind-fight)<br/>\n 5- Fighter<br/>\n 6- Paladin {Remove Disease, Turn Undead}\u00a0 (Extra Turning)<br/>\n 7- Fighter (Weapon Focus: Longsword)<br/>\n 8- Paladin<br/>\n 9- Paladin {Summon Mount} (Divine Might)<br/>\n 10- Champion of Torm<br/>\n 11- Champion of Torm (Improved Critical: Longsword)<br/>\n 12- Paladin (Divine Shield)<br/>\n 13- Champion of Torm<br/>\n 14- Champion of Torm (Knockdown)<br/>\n 15- Champion of Torm (Toughness) {Divine Wrath}<br/>\n 16- Paladin<br/>\n 17- Paladin<br/>\n 18- Paladin (Great Cleave)*<br/>\n 19- Paladin<br/>\n 20- Paladin<br/>\n 21- Champion of Torm (Great CHA I, Epic Weapon Focus)<br/>\n 22- Paladin<br/>\n 23- Champion of Torm<br/>\n 24- Champion of Torm (Great CHA II, Epic Weapon Specialization)<br/>\n 25- Champion of Torm<br/>\n 26- Champion of Torm (Chose: Epic Toughness I, Epic Prowess, Armor Skin)**<br/>\n 27- Champion of Torm (Great CHA III)<br/>\n 28- Champion of Torm<br/>\n 29- Champion of Torm<br/>\n 30- Champion of Torm (Great CHA IV, Great Smiting I)<br/>\n 31- Champion of Torm<br/>\n 32- Champion of Torm<br/>\n 33- Champion of Torm (Great CHA V)<br/>\n 34- Champion of Torm (Great Smiting II)<br/>\n 35- Champion of Torm<br/>\n 36- Champion of Torm (Great CHA VI)<br/>\n 37- Champion of Torm<br/>\n 38- Champion of Torm (Great Smiting III)<br/>\n 39- Champion of Torm (Great CHA VII)<br/>\n 40- Champion of Torm<br/>\n<br/>\n SKILLS SCHEDULE<br/>\n<br/>\n At will. Personally I beleive that any melee build should try to maximize Discipline. Frothis build having a high score on Persuade is also a must, the remaining points can be used on heal, tumble, taunt, or whichever fits your playstyle.<br/>\n<br/>\n *Great Cleave is there because there wasn't much to chose from. Could be ditched in favour of Iron Will, since it's the weakest save of this build.<br/>\n<br/>\n **Depending on how this build has fared so far, you get to chose:<br/>\n If you're taking lots of damage, take Armor Skin, or epic Toughness to increase hitpoints.<br/>\n If you're not hitting things as often as you'd like, take Epic Prowess<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>SPELLS:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n This build could perfectly do with less Pal leveles in favour of Fighter or -perhaps better yet- CoT. At level 22 you get two first level spell slots, two second level spells slots and one third level spell slots. Deafening clang should be on your prepared spells, as well as Bull's Strenght and Eagle's Splendor. Dispel magic is also nice to have to unbuff enemies. Failing that, Greater magic weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>TWEAKS I'VE CONSIDERED:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n Drop WIS to 12 and increase CHA to 16. This would allow one to ditch one GREAT CHA in favour of one extra Great Smiting, ending still with the same stats. You'll lose the third level spell and a second slot on the second level spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>THE GOOD:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n 20 turn undead to fuel DM/DS, 6 smite evil.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>THE BAD:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n Considering this is a sword and board build, it will nedd STR enhancing gear. A full plate plus a tower shield will spent almost all its weight capacity.<br/>\n<br/>\n Eagerly waiting on comments and critiques of this build.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Now I post any old tat I come up with, so it gets better!<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm afraid I'm got going to be much use in terms of full analysis - the last time I played a Pally was in Baldur's Gate, so am not even sure whether WIS or CHA governs their divine magic. However, from a melee-ist stance, it seems to me that you do need to boost your strength (or go a different route and play a finessed Dexer). Either way, I think you could either start with a better STR stat or sacrifice some of your CHA. Dropping DEX to 8, and WIS or CON to 12 (you've got Toughness to cover the HP difference) at the outset would enable a starting STR of 16. (If you were to take the CON reduction route, please don't be tempted to take Epic Toughness. Ever. There's almost always something better than that. An extra few HPs at that stage of your journey really shouldn't make any difference, while more AC or AB might.)<br/>\n<br/>\n Please excuse me on this one, I may well have it wrong, but would it make more sense to take feats like Knockdown and WS before Extra Smiting/Turning? In early levels WS can make a huge difference, so I might be tempted to blast Fighter 1-4 before taking any Pally, but I refer you to the first sentence of my last paragraph as far as my knowledge of Pallys is concerned.<br/>\n<br/>\n Regardless, someone sensible will be along soon...<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks again!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

So basically, if you wanna make a character who relies on those thigns, your CHA must be maximized at all times.<br/>\n<br/>\n You're probably right about WS being probably better at earlier stages. Regarding KD, in my experience, is better once your AB is somewhat decent. Can't count how many times I failed a KD, when it really counted.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

WS at level 7, not WF.<br/>\n<br/>\n IK requires INT 13, so this build cannot achieve it, otherwise it would be a must.<br/>\n<br/>\n Regarding AB, it's still a full 40 AB build (42 when using weaponf of choice and 43 if you take Epic Prowess), but it relies on STR enhancing gear to get past that, failing that, magic weapons. It shouldn't be that much of a problem because ogre strength gauntlets and belts of strength seem to be very common on most modules. <br/>\n<br/>\n So,basically, it shouldn't be too hard to get STR to18 or more in the teens, add divine might to that and not only you'll be hitting stuff but adding heaps of damage that ignore damage reduction or inmunities.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Well, I've now read Maximillian Kane's <strong>The Holy Class: A Guide to Paladins</strong> in the Game Guides forum, together with Hip's <strong>The Plight of Smite: Smite Evil Variants</strong> on page 4 of the Full Epic forum (for some reason), and I might want to revise my advice in light of those, given that this is definitely a smite-based build rather than an AB-based one.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thus, the starting stats seem fine - if anything, I'd now think about losing 2 from CON and putting it into INT, because - while I haven't worked out how many skill points you'll have - I'm guessing you're going to be fairly skill-starved. This matters because as well as max-ing Discipline and Persuade, Taunt would be very useful in assisting with your AB, and you'll also want a detection skill - Spot or Listen - or you won't have time to buff/prepare before a baddy surprises you. If you were to max these 4 skills, that's 172 points before any others can be considered. Now, I don't know how many points a Pally gets, but with INT of 10, 22 levels of CoT netts you 44 points and the 4 levels of Fighter bring a mighty 14 points. That's a total of 58, which is less than ideal. Even with INT of 12 that's only another 43 points, so unless 12 levels of Pally brings 71 or more points (in other words 6 points per level), it's going to be a struggle. Actually, just noticed, you have 24 levels of CoT, not the stated 22, which pulls in another 4 skill points (YAY!). Oh, and I'd be taking that final level of Pally later in the build anyway, for a final Persuade and/or Taunt dump.<br/>\n<br/>\n Hope this makes some sense!<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT:</strong></em> Just checked on Pally skill points, and they're the same as CoT and Fighter - 2+INT modifier. Thus, with an INT of 10, you'd have a total of 86 skill points: that's two maxed skills only, so I would really consider boosting your INT to at least 12, 14 would be better, but I understand what you say about not wanting a negative stat so you don't want to drop DEX to 8.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Messrs Dagger and Hip (those two in particular, but others were active as well) were responsible for opening my eyes to the importance of skill points - tumble raising AC by up to 8, spellcraft boosting saves vs spells by up to 8, concentration enabling one to resist taunts, UMD enabling use of all sorts of stuff you couldn't otherwise, etc, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n I'll confess that I haven't used taunt much myself, but Max's Guide made was very helpful in that regard - give it a once-over if you haven't already.<br/>\n<br/>\n IKD would also enable you to bin the GCleave malarkey as well - every one a winner!

That means a further 43 points, so you might get away with 12 INT if you really want to, with maxed Disc, Persuade, Taunt and Spot (CoT doesn't have Listen as a class skill). The further 43 points that INT 14 brings would enable you to cross-class 20 levels of Tumble for +4 to your AC (more than making up for starting DEX at 8), or do the same with Spellcraft (18 levels, giving a nett 20) for +4 saves vs spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n As hunearo also clarifies, you'd have access to Expertise as well, which might be of greater value than IKD, depending where you play.<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and just to throw something else into the mix, it would be possible to drop starting WIS down to 13 and bring it up to 14 by an epic CoT bonus feat in Great WIS.

I must recognize that most of the improvements came from you all. <br/>\n<br/>\n It occurs to me that there's another tweak that could be implemented in this build: ditching the last two Great CHA in faouvr of two Great Smites. At level 40 this means a loss of a +1 bonus on CHA.<br/>\n<br/>\n Currently this builds adds 144 damage to smites at level 40, with this tweak it would add 216. <br/>\n<br/>\n So one would have to consider if 216 damage vs 144 compensates:<br/>\n<br/>\n -The loss of one turn undead (which also fuels DM/DS which this character is reliant on) from 20 to 19<br/>\n -The loss of one round on DM/DS duration<br/>\n -A slightly less powerful turn undead<br/>\n -A skill check point loss on persuade and taunt<br/>\n<br/>\n I guess it's not a bad deal.

That additional skill points is what set him apart from the rest of the crowd in a way.<br/>\n And i will miss \"Armour Skin\" from the selection of the epic feats, personally i like to take all those \"mandatory\" feats in any build.<br/>\n<br/>\n Good choice though that you took \"Expertise\" making use of that (unusual) high INT in this great smiter.<br/>\n<br/>\n Perhaps we should make our own thread for the replacement of the \"Divine Warrior\", like i have done with the \"Dwarven Wall\" already.<br/>\n There i can show you my own version, without interfering with Pelagiu's build.<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Nice take on the build, Demos, and one worth considering.<br/>\n<br/>\n However, I'm happy with my build's final result. As Valefor says, the longsword choice is there because it feels more iconic. Demos' version is closer to an undead hunter while mine tries to more or less be a \"classic\" knight, although from a RP standpoint, ride is missing. <br/>\n<br/>\n Feel free to add your own versions on this thread if you will, or open a new thread. I'm curious as to how others would implement this concept.<br/>\n<br/>\n P.S. My final version also has expertise. I wanna try that taunt/expertise combo Max explained in his own thread.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
