If so, and if you're not going heavy on Bard, then switching to Elf and Wizard might be an idea - you'll certainly get proficiency in longbow from the start. It's tough to work out without knowing your current class split.</div>",

      "content": "<div>Hello Fairy Master,<br/>\nIf you take half-elf, you must take WP Martial to get bow proficiency with the two classes you have chosen. Elves get racial proficiency with bows. <br/>\nYou can avoid the xp penalty with elf, just like Stagmeister says, with either taking equal amounts of Bard and Cleric or by taking Wizard instead of Bard.<br/>\nIt all boils down to what build you want.<br/>\nI usually try to take a moderate amount of strength, up to 14 if I can afford it, to add to damage. You can add to strength later with items or potions when you get higher mighty properties.<br/>\nA high number of AA levels will make your archer better with higher AB and better damage.<br/>\nWhen building an archer with Cleric, I aim at 15 Cleric levels to max out most buffs. If you take 14-16 Bard levels as well to avoid an xp penalty, you get a build that matures late, and you don't get much from only about 10 levels of AA.<br/>\nI have to admit that most things with Cleric 15 or Bard 14-16 will be a strong build, but more AA will make a better archer.</div>",

All this narrows it down a bit what you can build. <br/>\nIf I recall correctly you can also add gifts at start-up. <br/>\nDo they have normal xp penalties and alignment restrictions?\u00a0 Have they changed the requirements for qualifying for AA?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for your roleplaying, how important is being a cleric for this character? Or in other words; what emphasis do you want to put on the class in this build?</div>",
