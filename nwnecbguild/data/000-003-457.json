You could've taken a Bastard Sword to do infinitely more damage than a morning star. Regardless, you could use that Fighter level to raise Discipline and the last level can be Cleric, to grant you some extra spells / day.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The fear aura of the summoned Mummy is EXCELLENT against meleers. But you can go either way. The problem isn't exactly the fact you have an extra feat or not, it is what you are going to take with it. If you have something worth your while to take, then go for Cleric 19 Ftr 8 Rogue 3, otherwise go Cleric 21 and grab an epic spell (Greater Ruin or Mummy Dust) at lvl 30.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I would only take the Mummy, as the dragon summon is really weak. The mummy isn't exactly strong, but the thing is that the fear aura will do wonders for ya, especially in a 30 lvl cap world. If you're not going for the Mummy, then IMO take Fighter and get that extra feat, as none of the other spells you have access to are worth the trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
