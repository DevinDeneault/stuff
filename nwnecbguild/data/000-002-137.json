      "content": "<div>Hello all ECBers<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may be of interest to you as builders. I hope my observation is understandable to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Background</strong><br/>\nI am playtesting the spell-resistant kensai draft I recently wrote, in WoG. I took him to the Moathouse. Used my lovely stealth skills to great effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to give you context, pretty much every enemy on WoG uses stealth. My main detection skill is Listen, as it is a class skill for Monks, and I had pumped that to max.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had zero ranks in spot, and a Wisdom score of 8. No items to boost either listen or spot. Listen was going to be the way I could detect a stealthed opponent, essentially with a modified spot score of -1 vs modified listen score of 7.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy AB at the time was +9 wielding a scimitar +1.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>The event</strong><br/>\nI attempted to attack a bugbear from stealth.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bugbear was attempting to use stealth but I detected him, almost certainly through the listen skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nI noted the AB on my combat roll was +5.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also noted the AB on the bugbear's combat rolls to attack me was also 4 lower than expected.<br/>\n<br/>\nSubsequent combat AB was normal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/202001/10759084_65509fe46e8bf4160b3ba24c40d93d81_t.jpg\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Aftermath</strong><br/>\nI was puzzled by this occurrence. I had a gut feeling, for some reason, that taking the Blind Fight feat might resolve this issue. I had gained level 6 so I could do so with a general feat.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd with Blind Fight taken, my AB now behaved as normal (ie +10 from the extra level).<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Hypothesis</strong><br/>\nI believe that because the bugbear was in stealth mode, detected by the listen skill and I did not have blind fight, I suffered a -4AB penalty.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen when I did have blind fight, that penalty no longer is suffered.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs per the NWN Wiki: Attack Bonus (dot point number 3)<br/>\n<blockquote><div>Both melee and ranged\n<ul>\n<li>Attacker's\u00a0size modifier. -2 to +2 AB</li>\n<li>Attacker is\u00a0invisible\u00a0or target is\u00a0blind. +2AB (unless negated by the target's\u00a0blind fighting)</li>\n<li><em>Target cannot be seen (hidden, invisible, or out of visual range). -4AB</em></li>\n<li>Target is\u00a0flanked. +2AB (unless negated by the target's\u00a0defensive awareness)</li>\n<li>Target is\u00a0stunned. +2AB</li>\n</ul>\n</div></blockquote>\n<strong>Discussion</strong><br/>\nI am curious to what your thoughts are. Do you think my hypothesis is correct, or is there an alternative explanation?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thoughts are that in modules where enemies use stealth and listen is chosen as the detection skill (for the advantage of detection behind objects and around walls), that the addition of Blind Fight should be considered mandatory.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to incorporate Blind Fight in all my combat builds, but this could be an argument in such conditions where stealthy opponents are going to be encountered early, that Blind Fight be taken as soon as practical, particularly in builds which aim to attack from invisibility or stealth against similarly stealthed opponents.</div>"

      "content": "<div>I agree with your hypothesis: remembering that Listen opposes Move Silently while Spot opposes Hide. Thus Blind Fight is even more useful in Listen-based builds, essentially compensating for the lack of Spot. Obviously, True Seeing is also damned useful, but items/scrolls of it aren't exactly common early on. I confess that given the option of Spot or Listen, I would generally choose Listen (although it depends on the purpose of the particular build) - effectively enabling you to \"see\" enemies who aren't stationary around corners and through doors/walls - because more stuff seems available to enhance Spot: starting with Blind Fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",
