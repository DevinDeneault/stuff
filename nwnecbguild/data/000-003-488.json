Final build.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>SPECIAL NOTES</strong>: As with the first version, this one has 40 Tumble for that +8 AC goodness. However, this one gets to Spellcraft 18 for a +2 vs Spells save much more early on and takes advantage of more levels in Weapon Master thanks to the awesome advice given by Empyre65. Thanks man! As well, dropping Spot totally in favor of Listen alone has allowed for a much greater level of skill in detection. This is also thanks to the advice of Empyre65.<br/>\n<br/>\n Skills in general have changed around here... One thing to note is that the Search skill is VERY low. An item with Improved Evasion would be very nice to add to this character, and will help out in times when Evasion just isn't enough because you will most likely stop seeing traps nearing level 10, maybe, and of course beyond. So, that is something to consider. And there is only a few freebie points available, and not in the best of levels for them, unfortunately.<br/>\n<br/>\n As the first version, upon first recieving Devastating Critical at 31, with his STR of 25, the DC for the Fort save is 32, but finishes out at 40 upon reaching 40th character level and 30 STR.<br/>\n<br/>\n This guy boasts 2 more BAB with his primary weapon than the other version, as well as the aforementioned skill changes and improvements. I like that alot, personally. However, I opted to stick to upping CON to 16 for not only the HP bonus from it, but also the bonus to the Fort save in lieu of gaining another +1 to BAB, Damage, and Devastating Critical DC. You may of course think this is insane. It's an easy fix, however... Just don't take the Great Constitution general feats at levels 30 and 33 and simply substitute them with more Great Strength General Feats for a final STR of 32 and CON of 14. Your HP will be 504 if I'm not mistaken, and you will have one less Fort save, But you will of course gain the BAB, Damage, and DC to Devastating Critical. Sheesh... Maybe I AM insane....<br/>\n<br/>\n Again in this version Lore and Concentration will tap out, Albeit a bit later on, so there will be a need to either identify in stores, or use items/potions, and there may be problems from taunting. Unfortunately, concerning Concentration, this happens before overwhelming critical, and may be something to watch out for.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>FINAL NOTES</strong>: Just like any Dungeons and Dragons type character, this one is very gear dependent. Of course you will want the best heavy or medium armor, a very good shield, the best weapon of your chosen specialty possible, and any other kinds of gear that will help round him out. Stuff with lots of resistances, immunities, and the like will be nice as this is a pure melee combatant fighter with only low to middling utility skills for playing the campaign or modules. He will shine in combat, however... Especially in the very later levels after Overwhelming and Devastating Critical rear their ugly heads.<br/>\n<br/>\n And a great big THANK YOU to Empyre65 for pointing out some areas that helped this build come to fruition... I just wasn't aware of a few things that could make this happen at this level of efficiency. Have fun, folks!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>SIMILAR BUILDS</strong><br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build203787.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twinblade fighter 16 / weapon master 19 / rogue 5 (human) by SovranSpecific</a><br/>\n This build is different from the Twinblade in that it is not dual-wield specific, and is more focused on chosen weapon + shield.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><span style=\"color:#000000\">edit: per Hip 20160915 (corrections/additions of missing info, in</span></em><span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong> red</strong></span><em><span style=\"color:#000000\">, build promoted from post #7) </span></em><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Here's some thoughts about the build, to help make it better:<br/>\n * How about replacing 6 levels of Fighter with 6 more levels of WM? You would be trading 3 Fighter feats for 2 WM feats (losing Epic Toughness) and gaining 2 AB.<br/>\n * How about leaving CON at 14, where it starts, and boosting STR 2 more instead for +1 AB and +1 damage?<br/>\n * Spellcraft uses your modified score to give you that boost in saves against spells. With your 14 INT, got get +2 on you Spellcraft, so you only need to get to 18 ranks for a modified score of 20 to get your +4 to saves against spells. You would need 23 ranks in Spellcraft to get another +1 against spells, which is impossible with a cross-trained skill, so stop at 18.<br/>\n * As a Human, the preferred class is whichever has the most levels, so that would be Fighter. The Prestige class, WM, doesn't count for XP penalty, so that leaves Rogue as the only non-preferred class, so there are no worries about XP penalty with this character.<br/>\n * Having both Listen and Spot is mostly redundant, so I'd drop Spot for UMD, a very handy skill to have.<br/>\n * This one is a matter of preference, and it depends on where you're playing this build, but I'd swap the 2 crafting skills for Search and Disable trap.<br/>\n<br/>\nI use Open Office with the Character Build Calculator and it works alright for me. Make the original file you download read-only. Load it and immediately save-as in Open Office's native format with the name of your build. Save often to minimize lost work from crashes. Also, I use an older version (2806) which seems to be more stable in Open Office.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: In case you can't get the CBC to work for you, here's a blank buld file I used to use in Notepad before I started using the CBC.

I think I should, in fact, do this.  I'll try to look at where the class level changes should most appropriately happen, but do you have any  suggestions as to where also?<br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>Empyre65 wrote:</strong>* How about leaving CON at 14, where it starts, and boosting STR 2 more instead for +1 AB and +1 damage?</div></blockquote>\n\nThis is probably what I should do.  It is a point, hard to argue, and I think I agree.  I must admit to lamenting the loss of 80 endgame hitpoints, however, considering this change mixed with the change you suggested above about swapping class levels.  I know, 3 AB and a damage point are good to have!  but at a loss of 80 HP and a fort save point, hmm.  I might just stick with the 16 final constitution and drop 6 levels of Fighter for 6 more WM like you say, thereby only losing the 40 HP from Epic Toughness but keeping the 40 from Con and the fort save bonus too.  I'm considering this in combination with your idea to swap the Fighter/WM levels, thereby gaining 2 AB, and only losing 40 HP from ET and not losing the 40 from Con and the bonus to fort saves it gives.  Thoughts?<br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>Empyre65 wrote:</strong>* Spellcraft uses your modified score to give you that boost in saves against spells.

You would need 23 ranks in Spellcraft to get another +1 against spells, which is impossible with a cross-trained skill, so stop at 18.</div></blockquote>\n\nThank you for this!  This is the kind of stuff I was hoping for, the kind of thing that I don't really know about at this time.  Truly appreciate this kind of advice, Empyre!<br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>Empyre65 wrote:</strong>* As a Human, the preferred class is whichever has the most levels, so that would be Fighter. The Prestige class, WM, doesn't count for XP penalty, so that leaves Rogue as the only non-preferred class, so there are no worries about XP penalty with this character.</div></blockquote>\n\nAnd another big thank you for this bit of information, this makes me feel better.  By the way, I do in fact thank you and appreciate your entire post of advice, and not just these two points alone <br/>\n<br/>\n Also, considering the dropping of crafting skills, yeah, I think you are right.  I don't use UMD often I must admit, as I tend not to class mix to heavily even with items.  Perhaps I should list this as an option for those who do?  However I do in fact see the wisdom in it.  Also, in the having of only one of the detection skills, and picking up more search and perhaps disable traps.  I initially shy'ed away from disable traps due to not having rogue being a very large part of his RP concept, but perhaps I should write it in for the build itself.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks a ton for your input!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I won't just say that, obviously, I will also tell you why:<br/>\n<br/>\nFighter 14 Rogue 4 WM 22 has THE EXACT SAME NUMBER OF FEATS, a few more skill points too, true, but not that many, than a Fighter 12 Rogue 3 WM 25. The latter is commonly known to be the optimal spread of a FTR WM R combo aimed at high AB and damage. But f 12 wm 25 r 3 gets 1 more AB from Epic Superior Weapon Focus, so why not go for it?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, your build loses 1 further BAB by going Rogue first, again trading for skill points. If I were you, I would make it like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nFighter 12 WM 25 Rogue 3, go Fighter 10 WM 10 pre-epic, drop Iron WIll and take Power Attack / Cleave, and Weapon Focus (or Weapon Proficiency Exotic if that's the case). Take Rogue 1 at lvl 23, Fighter 11 at level 27, Rogue 2 at level 28 and Rogue 3 at 38 for max UMD / Tumble dumps.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn epics, all you General feats should go to Great Strength. You should take EWF, AS, EP, OverCrit and DevCrit as WM bonus feats and take EWS as a Fighter bonus Feat. That way you will end on 32 STR and a higher AB. Actually, I don't normally do this, but since this is going to the Build Request forum anyway, here you go. Here is a build I already have that utilizes this combo more efficiently IMO.

I have to admit, even after reading the rules/rules about posting section, I didn't realize I had posted this in the wrong section until after the fact, and look forward to when it will be placed in the proper place.  I definitely thank everyone for their input!  I think I'll go off now and try out this build that Maximillian Kane has provided.  Thanks again!<br/>\n<br/>\nPost-Script:  Sorry everyone, about placing this in the wrong section here.  That is one to grow on, I think... I'll not do that again.  Have a good one!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
