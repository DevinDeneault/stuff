      "content": "<div>Yeah, I've been indoctrinated by NWN2 for years now. Not an expert in that game, in fact could never bring myself to finish the mian story. I've always loved the idea of the game though, just too many problems. I recently saw a random comment on some random forum about NWN1 being so much better, so on a whim I checked it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n Why is it, that everything NWN2 is utterly incapable of, NWN1 has right out of the box!? WTF!?<br/>\n<br/>\n So, yeah, got NWN1 now and getting ready to play for first time ever. I only stopped to try and plan a build, but quickly realized I need to UNLEARN everything! *sigh*<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyone have updated links for some must-have mods? Been using Tony-K's AI for 2, but the link i found here in these forums is broken.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, would appreciate any suggestions or advice for cutting my teeth here.<br/>\n<br/>\n I know I'm about 20 years late on this, I apologize.<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, whoops, just now spotted the Introductions section of the forums. Sorry about that. XD</div>"

      "content": "<div>Welcome to the guild, amigo!\u00a0 It's unusual to encounter a player of NWN2 who has not tried NWN1 beforehand.\u00a0 You are a rare breed indeed! <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/11.gif\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n Check the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://neverwintervault.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>new Vault</strong></span></a> for any resources or utilities specific to NWN1.\u00a0 The Search there seems to work fairly well so it should be easy to find what you desire.\u00a0 If not, post the item you are looking for here and we will help you locate it.\u00a0 Most all has been migrated over from the IGN Vault but in the rare instance that it hasn't, it may being laying around on Rolo's archive.<br/>\n<br/>\n All of the tools listed by Kail have been <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/515320/Tools-of-the-builder\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>relinked</strong></span></a>.\u00a0 If you have Excel, Kamiryn's CBC will be a HUGE build designing time saver so make that first on your list.\u00a0 A trainer will make testing quick and painless.\u00a0 In this case, they are merely modules created that scale encounters according to your preferences and have a seamless leveling/re-leveling interface.<br/>\n<br/>\n TBH, the main complaint about NWN2 with the community has nothing to do with the gaming experience but rather with the different toolset that takes a lot of experience to understand.\u00a0 I also have NWN2 loaded and have no clue how to build with its toolset but jumped right in with Aurora and began making modules immediately.\u00a0 Obviously, the lure of NWN2 has been the superior graphics and AD&amp;D 3.5 (yes... you are going to need to purge 3.5 from your mind now and learn 3.0) but I am continually amazed by the innovations provided by the NWN1 modder community to bridge most of that gap.<br/>\n<br/>\n You are not 20 years late.\u00a0 It's more like 12 but NWN1 doesn't care.\u00a0 It's been waiting for you all that time! <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/7.gif\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>Thank you for the warm response. I can attest to the modding thing with NWN2 as I did try my hand at it at one point, and even with help accomplished a whole lot of nothing. Was attempting to give the Druid Shapeshifting ability what they're supposed to have instead of nothing but slight stat boosts. It seems even the modding community that does know how to do everything gave up on that though. Closest to it was people coming up with script that tracks enchantments and buffs and then reapplies them after you're wildshaped. Imagine turning into a Badger with claw attacks with 1d8 acid, 1d8 fire, vorpal, and vampiric leech, to give an idea what that looked like.<br/>\n<br/>\n I digress, thank you again for the warm welcome. I'm gunna head on over to the new vault shortly and grab Tony K's AI module. Anything else you might suggest just for modifying the OC+Expansions? Going in mostly blind.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, trying to load up the excell file you pointed towards even now. Normally Open Office doesn't have trouble loading XLSX files, but this one is a dousy. Thing just doesn't want to load. Thought about getting an excel viewer, but then I wouldn't be able to actually USE it, only look at it. -.- Ah well, I'll figure something out. Thank you for the help already!</div>"
