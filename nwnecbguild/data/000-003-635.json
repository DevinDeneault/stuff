However here with WM 25 and an effective Taunt ability the effective base AB is 40-46, depending on the concentration roll of your opponent, which matches any decent warrior build with 40-45 base AB.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few extra feats like improved knockdown and extra smiting would have been nice but I thought overall this balance was best and the build is feat starved. The Rogue 10 bonus feat would have been nice too for crippling strike or epic skill focus taunt, but would have sacrificed some AB. I squeezed divine shield in late to accommodate late skill dumps and the ability to take divine might mid build.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think any simple or martial one handed weapon can work well, I chose warhammer for the x3-&gt;x4 crit multiplier, bludgeoning damage and the +2 to threat range from Ki Critical, felt like the best choice.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Human is ideal here to qualify for WM at level 12. Halfling would avoid exp penalties but you will lose the human bonus feat, 43 skill points and due to small stature will want to get improved knockdown, which means essentially losing two feats, and will qualify for WM at level 15 meaning AB is either dropped by 1-2 (-1 less AB from WM 22 possibly -1BAB if you add rogue levels) or you lose your late Taunt and Tumble/UMD/Rogue skill dumps, lots of suboptimal things for a build which is already feat starved evidenced by 3 pre-epic feats in epic levels (power attack, divine might, divine shield)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's only one other Rogue / Paladin / WM build in the archives and EPA's ECB Filter Build search, Ithacan's\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build238337.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A Holy Sword for Dark Days</a> which is a strength based paladin Rogue 3 / Paladin 15 / WM 22, which is quite different.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span class=\"inline-attachment\">\n<dl class=\"fileimage display\">\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/202004/10759084_a4c621353a573fdebc9df6f623dc5b94.jpg\" />\n</dl>\n</span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:50%;line-height:normal\">Image source:\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://c4.wallpaperflare.com/wallpaper/568/175/657/kingdoms-of-amalur-monster-drawing-hammer-giant-hd-knight-illustration-wallpaper-preview.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://c4.wallpaperflare.com/wallpaper ... review.jpg</a></span><br/>\n<br/>\nBuild details:<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Rogue(9), Paladin(6), Weapon Master(25), Human\nSTR: 14\nCON: 10\nINT: 14\n\n01: Rogue(1): Dodge, Expertise\n03: Paladin(2): Weapon Focus: Warhammer, {Smite Evil}\n05: Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}\n07: Paladin(3)\n09: Rogue(6): Spring Attack\n11: Paladin(4)\n13: Weapon Master(1): Weapon of Choice: Warhammer\n15: Weapon Master(3): Knockdown\n17: Weapon Master(5)\n19: Weapon Master(7)\n21: Weapon Master(9): Power Attack\n23: Weapon Master(11)\n25: Weapon Master(12)\n27: Weapon Master(14): Great Charisma I, (CHA=23)\n29: Weapon Master(16): Epic Prowess\n31: Weapon Master(18)\n33: Weapon Master(20): Great Charisma III, (CHA=27)\n35: Weapon Master(22): Epic Toughness I\n37: Rogue(9)\n39: Paladin(6): Divine Shield\n\nSkillpoints: 287\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +4, Traps: +1\nAB (max, naked): 40 (melee), 31 (ranged)\nSpell Casting:\u00a0\n\n\n01: Disable Trap(4), Intimidate(4), Open Lock(1), Search(4), Set Trap(1), Spot(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(18),\u00a0\n03: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(3), Taunt(1), Save(10),\u00a0\n05: Disable Trap(1), Intimidate(1), Open Lock(4), Search(2), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n07: Discipline(4), Taunt(4),\u00a0\n09: Disable Trap(1), Open Lock(1), Search(3), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(3),\u00a0\n11: Discipline(4), Taunt(4), Save(5),\u00a0\n13: Discipline(2), Spellcraft(5), Spot(1),\u00a0\n15: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(6),\u00a0\n17: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(12),\u00a0\n19: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(18),\u00a0\n21: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(24),\u00a0\n23: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(5), Spot(1), Save(20),\u00a0\n25: Discipline(1), Spot(2), Save(13),\u00a0\n27: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(19),\u00a0\n29: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(25),\u00a0\n31: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(31),\u00a0\n33: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(5), Spot(1), Save(27),\u00a0\n35: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(33),\u00a0\n37: Disable Trap(6), Tumble(25), UMD(8), Save(8),\u00a0\n39: Discipline(1), Taunt(15),\u00a0</details>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLooks like something I would want to playtest soon, delighted to hear any comments / suggestions / encouragement<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Edit:</strong><br/>\nActually I am thinking Paladin 15 / WM 22 / Rogue 3 might be a better split and put Wisdom to 14 for spell casting, +5 AB from GMW +5 AB from Divine Favor would improve the build!<br/>\nI might redraft this one and post an update if it looks good!<br/>\n<strong>Update:\u00a0</strong><br/>\nI tried this with a Paladin 16 / Rogue 2 / WM 22 split, it loses 40hp, about 60 skill points, uncanny dodge and a lot of sneak for the privilege of paladin 16 spells (yes +5 AB from Divine Favor and +5 AB from GMW, but the casts / day are so poor, and they are easily dispelable I am unsure it is worth it when you can UMD any scroll you want anyway, equip a +5 weapon or get a buff from a party member), better detection and will save, I dont think it is as fun as my original build idea with all those rogue skills.

IT DOES NOT WORK.\u00a0 The mindsets are polar opposites.\u00a0 It all revolves around Sneak Attack.\u00a0 This thing is just not a Paladin thing.\u00a0 Taking advantage of an opponent and striking them when they are not looking, helpless, and unable to defend themselves.\u00a0 This is why Blackguards get SA and Paladins do not.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it isn't \"a few\" as you put it - it's basically all RP type situations.\u00a0 In action type environments, where only mechanical means are of interest, it doesn't really matter - there are no RP considerations.\u00a0 <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the heart of the matter right here (it's in the ruleset) :<br/>\n<blockquote><div>The paladin is a holy knight, crusading in the name of good and order, and is a divine spellcaster. From 1st through 3rd edition, paladins were required to maintain the Lawful Good alignment. In addition, compared with other classes the paladin class has one of the most restrictive codes of conduct and paladin characters are expected to demonstrate and embody goodness.<em> Failure to maintain a lawful good alignment or adhere to the code of conduct causes paladins to lose their paladin status</em> and many of their special abilities until they are able to atone.</div></blockquote>\n\nTo that, this specifically :<br/>\n<blockquote><div>[Typical tenets of the Paladin code are as follows (though many variants exist): \n<ul>\n<li>A Paladin must be of Lawful Good alignment.</li>\n<li>A Paladin may never willfully commit an Evil act.</li>\n<li>A Paladin cannot associate with any character who persistently commits acts which would cause the Paladin him/herself to Fall \u2013 notably Evil creatures.</li>\n<li>A Paladin must remain truthful and forthright at all times.</li>\n<li>A Paladin must give fair warning and due quarter to enemies.</li>\n<li>A Paladin holds stealth, subterfuge, attack from the rear, missile weapons and especially poison as weapons of last resort.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></blockquote>\n<br/>\nThe most important points being the last two here - and as SA cannot be \"turned off (that would be cool)\" and is always on, it is not something that a Paladin would do, unless there was no other option available.<br/>\n<br/>\nA Rogue, on the other hand, always has SA \"on\" - meaning any situation that applies to allow SA, a Rogue automatically does.\u00a0 This is in direct conflict with the Code of Conduct, and as such, would cause the fall of a Paladin immediately if used indiscriminately and without consideration, not to mention if used deliberately whenever possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one wants to have a \"divine rogue agent\" - go Divine Champion/Rogue.\u00a0 Or Blackguard/Rogue.\u00a0 Or Cleric/Rogue.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's like the \"change alignment\" builds (especially those that do multiple times).\u00a0 Mechanically, it's there.\u00a0 It's just for the most part, no DM is going to allow it - unless it is under special circumstances because of the conflicts of natures.\u00a0 One that I would allow is the fallen Paladin/Blackguard \"anti-paladin\" schism.\u00a0 It's a pretty famous trope imo, and one that should be the exception to the rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut a Barbarian that then changes alignment to Lawful to become a Monk, then changes back to Chaotic to advance as a Barbarian/Bard again, then back to Lawful to do a skill dump as a Mon, then back again to Barbarian/Bard, etc, that is just a mechanical technique that really isn't going to fly RPwise.\u00a0 Especially when it has to happen at specific levels...like, planned out.\u00a0 Ain't gonna happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that is the gist of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we were playing 4th or so, where the Lawful Good requirement and the Code of Conduct rules were changed, I would have no problem with Paladin/X.\u00a0 But as NWN is 3.0, there it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, one can play with houserules.\u00a0 Good ol' homebrew.\u00a0 That's basically what PWs, Mods, etc are when they deviate from the ruleset.\u00a0 And I have no problem with that.\u00a0 None at all.\u00a0 But when peeps pontificate that it should always be allowed, and that \"only a few\" (what a crock!) is the basis for their argument, then yeah, I have to speak up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you firmly are of the mindset that it should always be allowed, according to the rules, then show me where in the ruleset that we are using (what NWN is based on) that it states this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

And I have played enough paladins to understand what the rule book means with the class.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother way of looking at it is to look at the rogue class and try to figure out what kind of characters that are rogues. Originally the class was the thief class and rogue has evolved directly from that. But somehow the class has changed in some important ways. It now is possible to have a lawful good rogue! You can also choose freely what skills you want to focus on. You may ask what kind of character a LG rogue is supposed to be. You don't have to make the character a pickpocket. You can just avoid taking the skill. And open lock doesn't necessarily have to involve stealing or burglary. You can use it to gain entrance when you are going to arrest some outlaw. You have SA, but it is not always on. It only comes into play with KD, flank or surprise attack. A typical LG rogue character from fiction could be Macgyver. Think resourceful, problem solver, skillful, smart and versatile.<br/>\nI'm not saying that the core of a lawful good rogue is anything near the arch-typical paladin.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I roleplay - I mean really roleplay - in a way where I try to make an interesting character with several different and sometimes conflicting traits, my paladins tend to have a broader personality than the arch type, simply by being human. Sometimes that is expressed with multiclassing.<br/>\nHere somewhere is a small common ground or a niche where the two classes sometimes can overlap. But I clearly see the point\u00a0 where the paladin strays too far from his path and becomes a fallen paladin.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for game mechanics - I have no problem with the mix. It is not the best synergy, I would say cleric /rogue is far better. But sometimes it is fun to experiment with the classes just to see what build I can make.<br/>\n<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>\nThis is my personal point of view and does not represent the guild in any way\n</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
