So thank you very much.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI see no point in taking heavy armor there. Scale mail +5 with dex up via potion/spells will bring total ac 13, which is the same as full plate armor +4.\u00a0 Also, heavy armor doesn't go with the theme.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not about playing the most OP builds ever been there, at least not all the time and not for me. I fixed the missing info in the first post. If moderator wish it can be transferred to finalised level 40 builds, thank you.</div>"
