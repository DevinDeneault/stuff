      "content": "<div>So, there's a custom class in Blackstone Keep PW that gets a nifty katana. Requirements are you are Elf and get at least F2 and Sorc3 (not necessarily in any special order, as soon as you have at least F2/S3, you will get the katana).<br/>\nThere are two obvious ways to go (WM or RDD), each with two variants (pre-epic or post-epic), but I'm pretty sure I'm missing something... So, if I'm playing someone who is primarily running around hacking mobs to death and every sixth hit I give magic damage and self-heal a bit, what's the best build?<br/>\nBlackstone Keep is high-magic with bosses and mobs with some resistance and immunities. The most annoying thing is that the bosses have ridiculous AB/AC combos for the level you're supposed to be when tackling them, so dwarven defenders or Dex-WM are the most useful builds, also some cheesy variants. This could be something fresh, with a katana giving up to 45 magical damage every sixth hit, so I hope someone can help. Please?</div>"
