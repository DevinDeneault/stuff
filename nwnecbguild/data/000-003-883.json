Character creation seems to be really complex and I'm struggling a bit with my build. Any help, assistance or suggestions would be much appreciated :)<br/>\n<br/>\nCONCEPT:<br/>\nI'd like to play a rogue so that I can disable traps and open locks. I would also like to dual-wield melee weapons and prioritize combat ability. I assume this will be best achieved by building a STR based character rather than DEX but I'm open to suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) PvM or PvP<br/>\nOfficial campaign and expansions only (offline) so PvM<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Level cap<br/>\nMax level at the end of official campaign and expansions (from research I think approx level 1-28)<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Race preference<br/>\nElf (so that I have no movement penalty when making search checks)<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Class preference<br/>\nRogue (for traps + locks)<br/>\nPossibly multi-class with Fighter for extra combat ability<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Melee preference<br/>\nDual-wield! (preferably something sharp and nasty)<br/>\n<br/>\nMany thanks! :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">As Valerfor says, kudos, endjynn. I remember having to be encouraged (sometimes with sharp sticks) and cajoled into constructing my first build several months after joining the Guild.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've a couple of small items for discussion, if I may. Valerfor's quite right about full plate, but does that have an impact on stealth and /or HiPS? I just don't seem to recall seeing a fully-armoured HiPS-er before - not it's necessarily a bad thing, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, I notice you don't take the Use Magic Device (UMD) skill, and I really, really would. It will enable you to not only use wands and scrolls, but also equip some gear you wouldn't be able to otherwise (eg, Sun Soul boots and the like). I'd probably sacrifice Lore for it (but that depends on the result of the possible stealth issue).<br/>\n<br/>\nThird (and yes, this is me still playing fast and loose with the term \"a couple of items\"), it appears you're going for a Strength-based mainly Fighter build. That would mean you'd want the best BAB you can reasonably get pre-epic, particularly as you're D-W-ing, which will drop your AB by 2 for each attack. You're currently on BAB 17, but you could raise it to 18 by taking only 4 Rogue levels (possibly at levels 1, 3, 13 and 18) and taking 3 more Fighter levels - and you'd gain another bonus feat in the process. Improving BAB in epic levels isn't an issue, as it increases by 1 every other level regardless of class, so you could always make up for it then. Yes, you'd lose some skill points, but you'd end up better in combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
