Maybe I should replace these feats by more Great strength feats? Or maybe just keep Epic skill focus: discipline, drop epic fortitude for another GS and start with 8 intelligence (dropping listen and a bit of spellcraft) and 18 Strength?<br/>\n<br/>\nI've also been considering playing Valerfor's Iron Fist ( <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-iron-fist-monk-35-ftr-5-t2349903.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the-iron-fist-monk-35-ftr-5-t2349903.html</a> ), and more specifically the half orc version of it, but with more balanced starting stats, as I have read that AC is very important in WoG, but I wonder how useful are the improved SR and AC of such a build compared to the Monk/CoT/fighter's greater AB and saves.</div>"

      "content": "<div>I just got another idea: a human monk/fighter/paladin, using a single level of paladin as a skill dump for taunt, getting epic skill focus: taunt and using the improved expertise/taunt combo. He would only have 40 AB and 30 strength due to not being a half orc and only starting with 14 strength (I could start with more, but I'd have to sacrifice dexterity...), but with taunt and monk attack progression, he should nonetheless have an easy time landing devastating punches. However, that would mean no CoT to boost saves, nor improved SR from 30+ levels of monk. I'm not sure it's worth it.</div>"

I think I'll use that in the end, the high dev crit DC is quite appealing. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut would I really be sacrificing that much playability by delaying RDD to epic levels?

Maybe I should get some concentration? Perhaps even max it out? Though I hear (and see, after exploring the low levels zones a bit) that listen is also important, and now you tell me that so is search (search is not a class skill for monks, but it is for RDDs by the way)<br/>\nMaybe it would be better to take some points in both listen and search rather than trying to max them both out?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, just FYI Valerfor, I couldn't drop wf: kama in the build I posted because I needed it for the prerequisites to CoT ( wf: unarmed isn't considered as a melee weapon focus for the purpose of qualifying for prestige classes).</div>"

      "content": "<div>Well, the problem here is that, according to Valerfor, concentration is mostly needed until the mid twenties, which means that level 22 is probably a bit late to start assigning points to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, listen seems to be even more essential right from the beginning, as, while exploring the starting zones, I've been ambushed by all sorts of sneaky mobs. Those didn't seem too hard to detect though, my character was able to hear them despite not having invested a single point in listen. But a few points spent there would have made it easier. I guess that's why I see builds spending their spare points on listen in the WoG forum.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it isn't possible to have both concentration and listen in a timely fashion, I guess I could try to live without concentration, using monk speed to escape taunts. Though, if it's only to come back a few rounds later and get taunted again, this may not be such a good tactic (especially in narrow places where there isn't much space to run). Another alternative would be to max or nearly max concentration and just spend any spare points on listen, but it would only be worth it if there were taunter mobs in level 30 to 40 (though, from a RP perspective, I do like the idea of a fully focused monk who doesn't get distracted by taunts). In any case, I don't like the idea of dropping HPs or AC for skill points either.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing to think about is that, as a sorcerer, maybe he could get his hands on some scrolls of true seeing, for places where detection is really essential. Though true seeing has been modified there to give ultravision, see invisibility and a +20 bonus to spot instead of detecting hidden characters automatically, it would probably be of great help... if he can get these scrolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nValerfor, what would you recommend me?</div>"

But no BAB progression, making it inferior combat wise to B, who gets her fifth attack per round, as well as empty body<br/>\n<br/>\n19: A gets her first draconic ability strength increase, compensating for the lost point of BAB. Still, if scrolls of improved invisibility are rare and/or expensive, B might have an easier time in tough fights because of empty body<br/>\n<br/>\n20: A gets dragon breath while B gets perfect self (and 1 point of AC, giving her the same AC as A). Dragon breath seems pretty bad at this level, whereas the permanent, indispellable mind effect immunity from perfect self is very nice; while pots of clarity can temporarily give the same effect, perfect self ensures that even in cases of surprise attacks, dispels, or long fights during which clarity would wear out, you will not be defeated because of a failed will save. This is guaranteed to save your butt quite a few times, not to mention it can save you quite a lot of money since you have no need for clarity pots.<br/>\nAlso of note is that by this time, B has a much more competitive SR than A. Overall, my preference would go for B here, except if search is really a big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n21:Second draconic strength increase for A, allowing her to have one more point of AB and strike for 2 points more of damage than B. B Finally gets her first level of sorcerer and all the boons that come with it. At this point, A is probably overall stronger, having search and being a better combattant, except against mages or in zones with lots of mind effecting ennemies.<br/>\n<br/>\n22: A gets an AC increase, but so does B, who gets her first RDD level, and thus finally has search as a class skill. So utility wise, they are now equal. Combat wise, it will depend on the type of ennemies faced, as A has more AB and damage, but B has perfect self, empty body, and a better SR.<br/>\n<br/>\n23: B gets a draconic strength increase, and thus gains the same AB as A, while nothing much happens for A here. So this time, I'd say B wins hands down.<br/>\n<br/>\n24: A gets a draconic constitution increase, while B just gets the useless dragon breath... still, I'd say B is superior here too. Perfect self, 4 points of SR and empty body trump a +1 modifier in constitution and +1 damage per hit IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\n25: A gets a draconic armor increase, and thus has one more point of AC than B, while B gets her second draconic strength increase, which allows to actually have one more point of AB than A and deal the same damage per hit. Once again, it's a win for B.<br/>\n<br/>\n26: A gets a draconic intelligence increase while B gets a draconic armor increase, gaining once again the same AC as A. A complete victory for B this level, who has 1 more AB, the same damage and AC as A, while also having perfect self, empty body, 4 more points of SR, and only being inferior in constitution.<br/>\n<br/>\n27: That's the level at which A turns the odds, gaining 4 strength and 1 AC, and immunities to fire, paralysis, and sleep, while nothing happens for B. Thus A has one more point of AB, 2 more points damage, 2 more points to the dev crit DC (since that's the level at which crit dev is gotten), one more point AC, and has various immunities. This time A is undeniably stronger.<br/>\n<br/>\n28:\u00a0 A gets dumps skill points in tumble, further increasing the AC gap between the two, by 2 points. B gets the draconic CON increase. A wins by an even larger margin this time.<br/>\n<br/>\n29: A gets empty body while B gets a draconic armor increase, reducing the AC gap to 2. Still an overwhelming win for A.<br/>\n<br/>\n30: B gets the draconic INT increase, while nothing much happens for A. Still a win for A<br/>\n<br/>\n31: At last, B begins to catch up again with A, gaining +4 strength, the last draconic armor increase, and the RDD immunities, while A gets perfect self and an AC increase from monk 20. Basically the main difference at this point is that A has two more points of AC from tumble and B has one more point of AB from the higher BAB. Still, considering that AC is particularly important in WoG, I guess A wins by a small margin.<br/>\n<br/>\n32: Now B has it all: same AC and everything that A has but with one more point of AB. There is no need to analyze the levels ahead, as the A and B follow the same progression after that. So B is stronger once and for all at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, after through comparison of the two progressions it seems to me that there isn't much of a loss of playability from delaying the RDD levels for more long term power. The only levels at which A is significantly stronger than B are from 27 to 30. At all the other levels, either A only wins by a small margin, or the abilities of the two even out depending on the environnement, or B is flat out superior. And from level 32 onwards, B is stronger.<br/>\n<br/>\nThus it seems to me that delaying RDD is well worth it. If it was a kama build, where we could only take a few levels of monk pre-epic and get away with it, it would be another story, but since it's an unarmed build, and we need 16 levels of monk ASAP for 1d20 fists, there doesn't seem to be much benefit to rushing to get RDD.<br/>\n<br/>\nHence my choice.</div>"
