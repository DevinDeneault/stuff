Why that low a wisdom though for a high-level paladin? Paladins have very useful buffs and it is a shame not to have them by virtue of insufficient wisdom...Anyway, paladin 26/ fighter 4/ Cot 10 is a good &amp; reliable build and you can take 6 great strengths in epic levels in order to get to Str30 that you want. You will also have ews &amp; divine wrath along with the standard paladin abilities. The charisma of 16 is a bit low but you can still use it if you buff it to max 28. The other solution is to make her a dragon, paladin 28/ bard 2/ Rdd 10, that will give you lots of ability points, you already have the template for that I believe.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Yeah, just keep in mind that if you want to have spells (needs wisdom of fourteen) then paladin 26/ fighter 4/ Cot 10 is the best way to do it. You can go paladin 16/ fighter 4 pre-epic, then take all your Cot levels in epic. Cot has great wisdom as an epic bonus feat, same as ews, so you can have four great wisdom &amp; ews as Cot epic feats, paladin's ewf &amp; armour skin and six great strength from general feats, last one you get epic prowess. Not a bad solution in my opinion, just keep it as an alternative.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Paladins are required to be Lawful Good, but Bards are forbidden from being Lawful. Unless your PW changes Bards to be allowed to be Lawful (which has been done elsewhere), that combination is out. Even if you can change alignment at will, if a Paladin is ever not lawful Good, he becomes a fallen Paladin, with no Paladin abilities, and not allowed to take more levels of Paladin, even if he becomes once again Lawful Good (Somebody please speak up if this is not true in NWN.).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for a dragon Paladin, I suggest Paladin 28, Sorcerer 2, RDD 10. The 2 Paladin bonus feats can be Epic Prowess and Armor Skin, and the one general epic feat not used by Great Strength can be Epic Weapon Focus. If you divert 4 ability increases from STR to WIS, you can cast all the spells, and still end up with 34 STR. Take the 2nd Sorcerer level late for a Spellcraft skill dump. The +4 AC from RDD will make up for Tumble being only a cross-class skill. The +2 to CON, INT, and CHA are nice, too.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
