doesnt work as I need a melee focus first.<br/>\n<br/>\n Fighter gave me extra Pre epic feats, but I could not get both WS/EWS without giving up Epic Prowess (-1 AB/+6 DMG) and there is an XP penalty from level 30 onwards.<br/>\n<br/>\n Blackguard seems to work except that without gear/buffs, Dark Blessing actually applies a -1 to all Saves. (Although he can cast Eagle's to help in this area)<br/>\n<br/>\n Im also tossing up between Improved Crit, Empower Spell and Toughness for the level 18 Feat.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n I would appreciate your thoughts, along with any better options for the 3rd class.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks</div>"

      "content": "<div>I don't understand why you can't take COT - you're willing to spend 2 feats (power attack and cleave) to get blackguard, but not 1 (weapon proficiency martial) to get COT, and you get the feats back. \u00a0Just take weapon proficiency: martial at level 1, skip PA and cleave and not only do you gain a feat at level 1, but if you stick with your Cleric 26 Rogue 10 X 10, you'll get another 2 feats from COT, which you could use as epic feats for EWF and EP and gain two more Great Strength for another AB, or for PA/Cleave if you really wanted that. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n You shouldn't lack for AB or damage - for damage you have Darkfire, Divine Favor, Battletide, and GMW. \u00a0For AB you can buff right up to the +20 cap with a plain weapon (GMW +5, Divine Power +5, Divine Favor +5, Bless +1, Aid +1, Prayer +1, Battletide +2).<br/>\n<br/>\n I've never been a big crippling strike fan; since your reflex save is terrible, I'd take Improved Evasion with that Rogue10 bonus feat and save yourself half damage against most spells. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n For leveling, obviously server dependent, but I'd just go 20 cleric right off the bat and save the COT and rogue for epic. \u00a0If you really want tumble/umd dump, then cleric 16/rog4 pre-epic. \u00a0Unless you really need that discipline dump of COT then throw one in late pre-epic, but just getting your raw cleric power up is probably best. \u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n What exactly are you going for with the rogue? \u00a0You're not maxing out any rogue skills, or going DEX for epic dodge, or maxing hide/ms to get extra sneaks/crippling strikes, so you really just have KD, unless you're playing in a party all the time with lots of flanking. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n For your 18th level feat you mention a choice, but you already took Improved Crit at level 15. \u00a0Empower is server dependent - how easy is it to cap stats? \u00a0If hard then you probably want empower (or consider swapping trickery for WAR with aura of vitality and getting concealment from scrolls) but if not then toughness. \u00a0(With only 20 WIS your DC probably won't be high enough to make your damage spells worth it, but again, server dependent). \u00a0If you ditch BG for COT you can take both (Empower and Toughness) since you gain an extra feat not having to take PA/Cleave. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Dante</div>"

      "content": "<div>I quite agree with Dante except for the point about Crippling Strike.\u00a0 Reflex has no impact on the feat's effectiveness, just being able to deliver sneaks does. Within a shroud of Darkness (WIS 20 cleric has plenty of Level 2/3 slots) every successful hit is automatically a successful sneak attack (assuming the target is not sneak/crit immune or Tru Seeing, that is) which means the CS will stack quickly and become deadly.\u00a0 But this rogue takes too long to develop anyway so you won't be whacking away at STR until level 38. CoT does seem a better fit to me as well unless you are looking to RP an evil toon.<br/>\n<br/>\n However, you do realize that at CHA 8, there will be a -1 universal saves penalty from Dark Blessing, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n That means, in order to get some use out the class combo, you'd need to boost CHA up to at least 13-14, buff with Emp Eagle, take DivMight/DivShield and pretty much drain off your intrinsic AB.\u00a0 Too feat-starved to do any of that, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n Beyond the advantage of rogue's CS and UMD (a skill which should never be set higher than a modified 33 unless you expect the need to equip class items over 1M gold value), an LE monk would provide better saves and all the monk goodies except -3 BAB progression choosing a weapon other than kama.\u00a0 I love UMD but it's not worth gimping the potential of an overall concept (skilled evil cleric, I guess?).<br/>\n<br/>\n Never been a fan of STR-focused high-level cleric builds.\u00a0 They ruin the potential of DP too much and sacrifice stealth, reflex and AC in the process. You'd get the same Lock skill level with just a single training rank for a DEX build.</div>"

The best aspect of Divine Power is getting the extra attack back (assuming BAB 25 or less) and the AB boost...the STR boost is a distant 3rd on my list. \u00a0You get the first two benefits regardless of STR vs DEX. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n In a +5 environment, Strength based build would have AC of 57 (base 10, tumble 8, armor skin 2, +5 for all 5 items, +3 tower shield base, and 9 for plate+dex) without haste. \u00a0In this build assuming the same ending Dex score of 28 (let's assume you can cap dex to 40), you're looking at base 10, tumble 8, armor skin 2, +5 for 5 items, +2 large shield base, and 15 dex (robes) for AC of 62. \u00a0So a benefit of 5 AC, which is nothing to sneeze at, but I'd much prefer to just take Blood and Faith (you get the extra +4 RDD AC so you're only losing 1 AC point) and the extra 4 AB, but that's just me. \u00a0I've run Blood and Faith on many different servers and never once thought \"man, I wish this was a cleric/rogue\". \u00a0</div></div>"

      "content": "<div>Yeah, well.. to each his own I suppose, Dante.\u00a0 Most servers I play prohibit or severely nerf exploit classes like RDD, PM and SD so those classes are never part of the prescription.<br/>\n<br/>\n You conveniently ignored the most key points of my bias, stealth and reflex.\u00a0 STR does zip for saves and gimps stealth something horrible.\u00a0 So that's the main difference in preference... I feel more comfortable in robes that most often contain the enhancements I seek to optimize my combat style... you like heavy armor and pounding away.\u00a0 So be it.<br/>\n<br/>\n And speaking of Crippling Strike again... it has no affect on a DEXers AB, nor any effect on sneak damage.\u00a0 The only reason my preference baffles you is that you have never explored th0se benefits thoroughly enough real-time rather than in theory.\u00a0 When you have the time, I recommend doing so.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hip, <br/>\n<br/>\n I'm aware Crippling Strike has no effect on AB or sneak damage, where did I say it did?<br/>\n<br/>\n On the servers I've played on, I've found that by the time the crippling strike strength drain takes effect, the said mob will most likely already be dead or near death from actual damage.  And harder enemies and bosses are typically crit (and thus sneak immune).  <br/>\n<br/>\n While some servers may restrict some of the prestige classes, there are many that don't, so I thought we were supposed to consider a default +5 type server when commenting on builds unless there was a specific PW mentioned, not nerf'd worlds.  <br/>\n<br/>\n In terms of the AC, I was pointing out that by going with a well-known \"awesome\" build like Cleric 26 Rdd10 bard 4 (i.e. an optimized strength-based cleric build, which I thought is what we were doing here).  So at that point, you're looking at stealth and sneak damage (average of 17.5 dmg on 5d6 sneak) and reflex save as differences.  You could easily tweak the build above to have a stealth-in-plate version, though if you're going to spam out Darkness, it's less important).  My comments were based on the fact that if you're doing all that damage in Darkness, Crippling Strike might be less valuable on a strength-based build like the above than Improved Evasion, since IE will help negate the low reflex save and you have plenty of regular + sneak damage to kill stuff.</div>"
