Ranger is more demanding since one usually will want to get BoE which adds AB and damage vs FEs and which requires 21+ lvls. Also, Bard can definitely be used as a dump class granting access to AA, since it has both tumble and UMD, not to mention taunt.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>So any combination involving any of them will want to maximize them, because you get better the more you have.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Fighter and WIzard are a different story.

Ranger 10 in epic lets you grab Epic Prowess and spread the remaining 3 Rogue levels for Tumble dumps.  I know you plan to fight from afar but if mobs manage to reach you, you'll have dual wielding (assuming light/no armor - you're going DEX here) and Uncanny Dodge.  Not to mention Evasion if enemy mages decide to use you for target practice of their own.  If you're in a group then hopefully your tanks can keep them off you but sometimes *stuff* just happens.</div></blockquote>\n\nIn that case I'd suggest Ranger 10 AA 15 Rogue 5 for +1 AB, as AA gains +1 AB every odd level and Rogue 6 gives you nothing except skill points<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
