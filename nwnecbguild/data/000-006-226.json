      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Not specific to this build, Hip, but you say that Stunning Fist is underappreciated...and you're not wrong. I have <em>never</em> had a successful strike with it, and I love Monk (you know what I mean). To be fair, because it had bombed so badly for me, I never really tried it after L14 or so. It may have something to do with my playing PvM/E rather than PvP, but still, it makes me suspect I'm either missing a trick or am stupendously unlucky (heavens forbid that it's just me not doing it right). Any guidance?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

But, of course, you need to choose your targets well.\u00a0 Crit immunes are stun immunes and high Fort targets like dragon have a very small chance of success.\u00a0 But the attack penalty is not too bad, only -4.\u00a0 Understand though, that until your AB reaches a decent level, your attempts will not even connect let alone succeed in stunning.\u00a0 I am particularly partial to the 3 round paralysis which is usually long enough for a coup de gr\u00e2ce.<br/>\n<br/>\n High-level casting clerics are ideally suited to be stunners but usually they will wield weapons that can be buffed rather than go unarmed and miss those opportunities.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
