      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Recently I've been playing around with the NWN toolset in the hope of eventually being able to write and understand NWN scripts. As part of that I've decided to work on my \"ideal\" PvP server, although it's highly unlikely that I will ever actually make it since I'm really just interested in learning about scripting. I've already started planning the balance of the server since I want to do that before I'm limited by minor details such as whether the proposed changes are actually possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe focus of this post is potentially unbalanced PvP builds on this hypothetical server, in particular high AB and AC values. I've already got a list of some of the problem builds that could cause issues but I'm interested in other potentially OP builds I might have missed. I'm not looking for full build guides, the class spread alone will be enough for me to work with. Currently most problem builds have AB in the +55-+70 range and AC in the 65-80 range. This 10 AB/AC gap is roughly what I'm aiming for, I'm planning to balance damage next so it won't be a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe relevant details for AB/AC are:<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>\nLevel 40 builds only, no alignment restrictions.\n3 or 4 maxed out abilities (eg can cap STR, DEX, WIS, and CHA with just items and potions).\nExpertise/IExp is disabled while casting.\nMage Armor is available for everyone, caster level 15.\n\nBarbarian Rage gives +2 AB, Greater Rage gives +3 AB, Mighty Rage gives +4 AB, these bonuses don't stack.\nThundering Rage adds +6 AB to the weapon (so actually only +1 AB since it's on a +5 EB weapon, but it penetrates the 40/+6 DR of dragons).\nDruid/Shifter\nAll item properties stack properly EXCEPT Shield AC which does not merge.\nI'm considering giving unarmed wildshape forms +5 EB creature weapons when shifted, but for now they are stuck with vanilla creature weapons.\nPM\n\nOath Of Wrath gives +10 AB vs Race to the weapon (so actually only +5 AB since it's on a +5 EB weapon, but it penetrates X/+10 DR).</details>\n\nBelow is the current list of problem builds. I only looked at rough minmaxed versions so the numbers might be off slightly.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>\n===\n---\nBarb28/Bard2/RDD10 (Half Orc) - +66 AB. 66 AC.\nBard26/Pal4/RDD10 (Human) - +60 AB. 76 AC.\nCler28/Bard2/RDD10 (Human) - +68 AB. 75 AC.\nFigh8/WM28/PDK4 (Half Orc) - +72 AB. 58 AC.\nPal20/Bard4/PM16 (Human) - +64 AB. 77 AC.\nPal29/CoT10/Monk1 (Human) - +62/+76 AB. 72 AC.\nRang26/Bard4/PM10 (Half Orc) - +61 AB. 65 AC.\nRang35/PDK4/Bard1 (Half Orc) - +68 AB. 62 AC.\nDEX Melee\nMonk9/Cler26/SD5 (Halfling) - +65 AB. 73 AC.\nMonk21/Figh14/SD5 (Halfling) - +50 AB. 75 AC.\nRang26/Figh4/SD10 (Halfling) - +61 AB. 71 AC.\nRog16/Figh20/Pal4 (Elf) - +56 AB. 80 AC.\nRog19/Bard5/PM16 (Halfling) - +53 AB. 81 AC.\nWiz3/PM24/SD13 (Halfling) - 84 AC.\nRanged\nBard5/PM16/AA19 (Elf) - +64 AB. 74 AC.\nBard8/SD10/AA22 (Elf) - +66 AB. 64 AC.\nFigh8/Bard3/AA29 (Elf) - +73 AB. 65 AC.\nRog33/Figh6/SD1 (Halfling) - +55 AB. 71 AC.\nCaster\nBard24/PM16 (Halfling) - 86 AC.\nSorc38/Pal1/Monk1 (Gnome) - 67 AC.\nShifter\n[Dragon]\nDru18/Wiz21/Monk1 (Human) - +54 AB. 83 AC.\nRang21/Dru18/Monk1 (Human) - +63 AB. 78 AC.\n[Elder Air Elemental]\nDru20/Pal17/Monk3 (Human) - +54 AB. 86 AC.\n[Epic Kobold Commando]\nMonk18/Dru5/Shif17 (Human) - +49 AB. 80 AC.\n[Epic Manticore]\n---\nCler25/Dru5/Shif10 (Human) - +55 AB. 62 AC.\nMonk25/Dru5/Shif10 (Human) - +40 AB. 78 AC.\n[Risen Lord]\nDru5/Shif13/DD22 (Dwarf) - +46 AB. 56 AC.\n---\nCler25/Dru5/Shif10 (Human) - +56 AB. 58 AC.\nMonk25/Dru5/Shif10 (Human) - +41 AB. 75 AC.</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It reaches +71 AB and 76 AC which is higher than the Pal/RDD but still in an acceptable range. Removing the 4 AC from RDD10 is probably the easiest nerf to make, but for now I think I'll leave it as it is.\u00a0I'm also planning on adding some kind of incentive for two-handers so that would probably lower the average AC values.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main inspirations I have are Antiworld and Neversummer 4, I really enjoyed the PvP on both of those servers so I'm aiming for a similar level of balance on mine. Neversummer 4 is probably the most balanced (although not completely balanced) PvP server I've ever played on but it has so many changes that it requires a wiki. Unfortunately changing things to that level is far beyond me right now so I'm mainly looking at simple changes.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">(Time to randomly poke my head in again!)<br/>\n<br/>\nPvP in NWN is full of imbalance, so there would need to be an awful lot of changes made to head in the direction of the 'ideal' PvP server. And even then, there would most likely still be certain classes and builds that shine moreso than others.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking at NWN <strong>vanilla </strong>classes in a Vacuum, purely from a melee perspective, here's a list of some of the more impactful abilities that certain classes have:<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Bard:</strong> Effective +7 AB/AC from song levels 16-24, +8 at 25-29 (assuming plenty of perform gear), +9 at level 30+.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cleric: </strong>+5 boost to AC/Natural/Deflection/Shield, can hit +20 AB cap, highest potential Spot skill in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Druid: </strong>Gets Dragon Shape, which can be problematic for PvP under certain conditions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Fighter:</strong> Gets a bajillion feats, so will end up being a 'mix class' for an awful lot of builds. <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Monk:</strong> Gets extra movement speed and Wisdom bonus to AC. <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Paladin:</strong> High Base AB, +8 to AB from spells, Charisma to saves. <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Pale Master:</strong> Highest amount of free AC available in the game, Crit/Stun/Paralysis immunity.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Red Dragon Disciple: </strong>A range of free Ability points, free AC, Fire immunity.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Shadowdancer:</strong> You only need 1 level of this to be exceptionally annoying.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Weapon Master:</strong> Highest DPS class available in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\nSo. I guess a starting point would probably be to nerf some of these classes in some way. I only really know Antiworld's ways of dealing with PvP imbalance, so perhaps these suggestions are short-sighted. But none the less, some suggestions could be:<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Bard:</strong> Lower the AB/AC threshold of Song. Antiworld had a max of +3 AB/+3 AC for pure level 40 bards, and some sort of level scaling involving skill points as well. I don't know if you would go quite this far, but at the very least I'd cap Song AC, and scale it so that more levels are required to hit AC boosting thresholds.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cleric: </strong>Lower the impact of AB buffing spells, and perhaps lower the impact of AC boosting spells (so that battle clerics are not so oppressive pre-20). This could be done on a spectrum of 'a few small nerfs' to 'so much of a hit that Clerics have to be played as casters and not battle-buff-bots'. Perhaps their buff spells could just not be made to stack with each other in terms of AB (capping it somewhere between +5 and +10).<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Fighter:</strong> Probably not much that could be done, other than buff other melee classes like Barbarian, Blackguard, Assassin and Ranger.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Monk: </strong>This one's hard. <br/>\n<br/>\nMovement speed is nigh impossible to truly balance in any PvP game, and for NWN PVP it just enables monks to be hit-and-run bots with next to no counterplay, pending restrictions on standing still and hitting things (see Antiworld). So perhaps it could scale slower and have a cap of say 50% extra instead of 130% extra, and there should be Antiworld-style honour-bound restrctions preventing people from disengaging combat until at least 1 round has transpired.<br/>\n<br/>\nWisdom AC is fine most of the time, but there are certain circumstances where it is also problematic for balancing (Shifter builds, Zen Archer Caster clerics). So perhaps its' impact could be lowered for certain shapes (pretty sure Antiworld just gutted the concept entirely but made all AC items stack), and there could be a level scaling of say 5 +1 Wisdom AC allowed for each Monk Level (to dissuade the 1-monk class dips).<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Paladin:</strong> This one's also hard, because Paladins have a lot of things going for them. I'd probably just nerf Divine Favour (which would also hit clerics) to +3, but then also place a limit on Charisma-benefits scaling dependent on Paladin level (to dissuade the 1-3 Paladin dips for free saves/div shield, which would help against dumb AC Sorcerer builds that havent even been mentioned yet).<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Pale Master:</strong> They need some sort of extra weakness. Maybe 50% extra damage from Bludgeoning would be nice, similar to BSK, in addition to their reduced AC. Would incentivize people to use something other than high-crit-range pointy sticks at the very least.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Red Dragon Disciple:</strong> Make them good at less things. I'd be inclined to take their AC away completely, and perhaps even give them something like a Cold damage weakness (so that Ice Storm would be their bane). Meddling with RDD abilities typically causes the game to flip the f**k out, so I'd probably leave those alone lol.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Shadowdancer: </strong>Hide in Plain Sight is hard to balance as well. Antiworld did well with their honourbound restriction of 1 use every 18 seconds in combat, so perhaps this would be enough. <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Weapon Master:</strong> Maybe change the way their feats work, so that they apply more of an effect to Two Handed weapons than One Handed. WM's typically aren't 'too' problematic in PvP though (given that they're tricky to mix with other OP classes like PM and RDD), so perhaps they could just be left alone.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\nSooo there's some suggestions. Of course, you could just elect to buff other classes instead of nerfing these ones, but I think nerfing the obviously OP stuff would be a start.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then there are spells, items, etc. would need to be input in a certain way, but these would probably be easier to figure out once the server has been play tested a bunch. Assuming it ever gets made. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I guess for the moment, you could toy with the idea of implementing a few nerfs, punch them into certain build combinations, and see how they effect the numbers? At the very least, you'll be able to reduce the impacts of certain 'overpowered' classes, which are ultimately what makes certain build combinations as strong as they are.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">The idea isn't to make a completely balanced server where any build can fight equally with any other build, just a place where the really overpowered feats/spells (such as Epic Warding and HiPS) are toned down. If somebody wants to click the recommended button and make a Figh40 then they can, but I wouldn't buff/nerf things to the point that they can compete with actual decent builds. Even with nerfs mages and clerics would probably still be top tier, just not the unbeatable monsters that they usually are in low/medium magic PvP. Most Rogue builds would still be countered by most PM builds, most mages would still be countered by most rakshasa builds, I'm fine with that kind of balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now the only thing I've really focused on is the AB/AC balance, I want to work on damage and DI/DR next. I already have plenty of nerf ideas but I haven't looked at them in detail to balance them. Looking at your list, Monk Speed is the only thing that I haven't already accounted for. I would probably just leave it alone, there are already ways to deal with Monks.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo give a few examples of the planned buffs/nerfs: AAs and PDKs can penetrate Epic Warding (30/+10 DR), Assassins get scaling Magical damage, and builds with HS5 do Positive damage against enemies with critical immunity. So although PMs and DD/Shifters are still annoying builds there are now ways to fight them without relying on casters.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I ever actually released the module I would stick with nerfing the major problems and then let the players find the resulting balance. Anything that's really broken would eventually be noticed and (ab)used, I could always nerf things after releasing it.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I've almost decided on everything regarding AB/AC now, I'm planning to deal with damage next. The main two changes not aready stated in the OP are adding +5 EB to unarmed shifter forms (except dragons) and removing the +4 AC from RDD10. The AC bonuses from RDD15/20/25/30 will remain since they're not really a problem. I think PM and RDD AC changes can be done by editing 2da files in NWN EE, but I've only messed with a few 2da files so I'll leave those changes for later.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter your suggestion I looked for a Monk Speed script but it appears to be hardcoded. So my options are to either apply a custom Haste effect to Monks or make a change that will requires haks. Ideally all of the changes I make will be server-side so for now I'll just leave it alone. I've got the hang of spell scripts, so if needed I could change a spell like Vine Mine to temporarily immobilize any character with more than 3 Monk levels. The main downside is that most Monk builds would be hard countered by most Druids, although I could make it so that the duration is based on the ratio of Monk and Druid levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently I've edited some spell scripts and Oath Of Wrath, the next thing I'm planning to work on is shifter item merging.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Currently I've finished scripting most of the easy stuff and I have a rough idea of how to do some of the tricker stuff. I'm now trying to decide how to limit spamming, unlike Antiworld I want to try and script it rather than use an honour system. To begin with I'm working on spells since they're easy to change, but eventually I want it to work on hardcoded things like Disarm and Knockdown too. I've got a few questions about how cooldowns should be applied with respect to a team PvP environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll use Terrifying Rage as an example since I'm using that as my prototype. Currently when an enemy enters a Terrifying Rage aura they get given a temporary immunity to Terrifying Rage. If they are immune or if they pass the save then they get 3 rounds immunity, if they fail the save and get paralysed then they get immunity until 3 rounds after the effect ends. The main problem with this is that it's possible to remove the paralysis. With Terrifying Rage it's not too bad, but when it applies to all limited abilities/spells there will be issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, let's say you fail the save and get a 3 round paralysis. You now have a 6 round immunity to Terrifying Rage from the moment you fail the save. However an ally could remove the paralysis effect with FoM, at which point you still have the full 6 round immunity despite not having the full 3 round paralysis. Ideally casting FoM would lower to timer to 3 rounds from save fail or remove the immunity if 3 rounds have already passed since the save fail, but scripting that seems pretty tricky with the inbuilt functions. This would also apply to spells such as Dominate Monster and the Bigby line, so this could result in a significant immunity duration despite the target being free of the spell effects.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you think it's worth attempting a fix for this or should I just accept the potential problems it can cause?<br/>\nI think I have a possible solution but it would take a lot more work than the current system.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother problem is that this immunity applies to all uses of Terrifying Rage, regardless of the Barbarian using it. So if you pass a 20 DC Terrifying Rage you are now immune to Terrfying Rage for 3 rounds even if you are fighting a different Barbarian with a 50 DC Terrifying Rage. This means that if you're facing two clerics with Implosion they can only cast 1 Implosion on you every 3 rounds, instead of 1 Implosion each every 3 rounds. The main advantage is that chaining death/disable effects would be harder, but it would also cause issues with team composition and build overlap.<br/>\n<br/>\nShould I leave this or should I make the immunity work per caster?<br/>\nPersonally I haven't decided which method is best. Leaving it would make team composition an important factor but I can also imagine the frustration it would cause for casters.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, I'm looking at a spell category list similar to the one that Antiworld had. For example all death spells would be on the same timer, so you can't just cast Destruction if your Implosion fails.<br/>\nThe current categories I have are:<br/>\nDeath (eg FoD, Implosion, Wail)<br/>\nMovement Restriction (eg Balagarns, Bigby9, Dominate Monster)<br/>\nDisabling, which is pretty much every other non-damaging DC spell (eg Energy Drain, Sunburst, Word Of Faith)<br/>\n<br/>\nShould I split the disabling category into more groups or will these 3 categories cover everything?<br/>\nI remember Antiworld had more categories but I can't remember the specific types.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>====\n---\n===\n---\nRage: +2 AB from Rage. +3 AB from Greater Rage.
