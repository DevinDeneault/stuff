Here I might are some possible ways (not tested) this could be improved:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Ditching the Concentration skill, and putting Int at 13, Cons at 9<br/>\n- Taking Monk at Lvl 1 and 37, allowing the player to skip Exotic Weapon Proficiency at level 1, and going Paladin 31 / WM 7 / Monk 2<br/>\n- Focusing on Charisma rather than Strength, would increase the offhand damage, prolong Divine Might, allow more Divine Might casts, improve Lay on Hands<br/>\n- Using better items<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I do know that would not improve the build is using Power Attack instead of Flurry of Blows. Here is the math I did, using the same set up as above.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>With Power Attack (please note Flurry of Blows does not stack with Power Attack) and same set up as above</em><br/>\nHit Points: 378<br/>\nArmor Class: 34 (36 vs Evil)<br/>\nStr 32 Dex 15 Con 8 Int 14 Wis 14 Char 25<br/>\nSaves: Fortitude 26 / Reflex 28 / Will 25. All +4 vs spells. +2 to saves against Evil. Immune to death magic. Immune to Fear.<br/>\nBAB: 30<br/>\nAttack Bonus (Imaskari Kama main, Imaskari Kama offhand, buffed with Greater Magic Weapon): +49/+46/+43/+40/+37/+34/+49/+46 plus one attack from Haste\u00a0<br/>\nDamage\u00a0(Imaskari Kama main, Imaskari Kama offhand, buffed with Greater Magic Weapon / Divine Might / Divine Favor) - Main: 1d6 + 16 +1d4 acid +5 slashing +5 magical +7 divine. Offhand 1d6 + 10 +1d4 acid +5 slashing +5 magical +7 divine.<br/>\n<br/>\nEstimated damage / round without criticals -&gt; (1d6 +16 +1d4 +5 +5 +7) x7 + (1d6 +10 +1d4 +5 +5 +7) x2 = Slashing (9d6 + 132) plus Acid (9d4) plus Magical (45) plus Divine (63) =\u00a0<br/>\n258 - 330\u00a0damage per round\u00a0without critical hits, of four different damage types<br/>\n<br/>\nAssuming 1 in 5 criticals with x3 modifier (add x2 for 20% of attacks: +103.2 to 132)<br/>\n361.2 - 462 damage per round, if critical hits are allowed,\u00a0of four different damage types<br/>\n<br/>\nImproved power attack I do not know the math. Possibly the -10 AB from the skill could be prohibitive so I would assume it wouldn't be worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've also tested using 9 Ranger Levels (for the dual wielding feats with no armor / light armor, and to allow you to not have such a high dexterity level) instead of 7 Levels of Weapon Master, and it feels weaker when I put my left-over feats into Greater Strength, with poor synergy with the Ranger abilities. My suggestion is it isnt as strong.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Finally</strong><br/>\nThanks for reading, and hope you enjoyed my guide!!!!\u00a0<br/>\nHope its a unique contribution to the builds listed here, as I haven't seen anything similar in the forum, but do speak up if you have written a similar build previously, I would be delighted to have the opportunity to read it.<br/>\nHappy gaming!!!</div>"

You have not taken any general feat on lvl 27. You have taken 25 cross classed ranks of Spellcraft by level 38. And you spend more skillpoints than you have.<br/>\nYou claim that this build has 4 different damage types. It only has 3; slashing, divine and magical. What you have on your weapon is irrelevant, you could just as well have a weapon with a negative, fire, lightning, acid, cold, sonic, piercing and bludngening damage bonus and claim that the build has 11 different damage types. The point is that we post our builds as they are, naked, like you do at first, for easier comparison. We may sometimes also be interested in what the capped values are, maxed out with items, and we want to know what self-buffers can achieve with their own buffs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the build:<br/>\nA strength build that starts with Str 14 and ends with only 23 is not very good. If you took G-strength on your unused epic feat, your AB will be 42. Your Paladin buffs will do a lot to help, when they become available.<br/>\nA monk with a naked AC of 24 is not very good. If you can cap both Dex and Wis, it will be 36, and that is good. But the single tumble dump and the Monk AC bonus from Wis come very late, so you have to suffer a very low AC throughout most of the career of the character. When you rely on dex based AC, you also want Uncanny dodge, which this build does not have.<br/>\nCha 14 is a bit low for a serious charisma build, even if you can self buff charisma. E.g. 11 damage x 11 rounds that you can achieve with a base charisma of 20 is twice as good as the 8 damage x 8 rounds that is the max of this build.<br/>\nYou are very ambitious when you want WM, ITWF, and DM in a single build like this, and like you say, it is feat starved. As a consequence you take a lot of pre epic feats in epic levels. A build with the ambition to dual wield and have 10 attacks per round with magical and divine damage, would do much better with a higher strength or charisma from great ability feats. Many beginners make this mistake; they want too much to go into the build, and as a consequence the build becomes weaker. We have all been there.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: Clarified the text above.\u00a0</div>",

It is indeed possible to start with monk for the extra 8 skill points. I didn't start with wisdom 12, because then you have to wait too long for the level 3 and 4 paladin spells. <br/>\nI took great wisdom on two CoT bonus feats. It helps AC, the will saves and gives an extra level 3 spell-slot. But most imprtantly I took \u00a0CoT to lvl 10 for the better saves and Divine Wrath. If you take great cleave pre epic, you may be able to squeeze in dev crit with the bonus feats instead.<br/>\nThe build is open to several tweaks. The most obvious is perhaps that you can get +2 AB and damage if you take strength to 30 instead of improving the charisma. But that hurts all the divine feats and the saves.</div>",
