It would just be foolishness not to, one cannot let one spell freeze the whole server, especially since NPCs cast it too. I've seen TS sequences that \"paralyzed\" me for enough time to go and make a sandwich   <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, aye, TS is fixed in PWs. The typical fix is to let it affect only the area the caster is in.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Whether that was an intentional side-effect or just a best-case-compromise type fix, I wouldn't know.  But that server was operating that way for at least 5 years that I can recall. The effective range of effect allows any artillery attacker outside the range of the effect of the TS caster to attack all those within its effect with impunity.  But once again, that is the way the spell was scripted on that one server.  I suspect the range of effect is the problem scripting the spell, deciding what range make the most sense and produces the least lag.  It can't be infinite or it would produce a real can of worms.  Imagine what happens when 50 PCs are running around spamming Timestops on the same server, especially if items are provided that contain that spell property.<br/>\n<br/>\nI imagine that the server freeze problem would have been eliminated on any of contemporary well-managed servers today.

I have, in my day, read a few builds of all sorts.  In all the builds I have read, I cannot recall a single mention of time stop.

To get to it, you need to give up alot of other things (stats, feats).  To get time stop, you just follow the wizard path, which, as time goes on is incredibly powerful.  Yes, by taking wizard you are not open to melee or divine casting or being a shape shifter (druid, shifter), and an argument could be made for each of those being a detriment to the wizard class.  however, any moron can get to time stop!

Suppose an environment built their uber bosses so that it would be impossible to kill them by any means OTHER than using Timestop.  You need not suppose too long because they are out there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are varying degrees of \"cheapness\" throughout NWN any of which which can render a sound build strategy as ineffective.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI am guessing that is why Timestop was set to 9 sec duration just like True Strike, another easily exploitable spell.  The game originators could anticipate the potential even then.  Take notice that throughout all the patching, both these spells have remained more-or-less the same as when they were conceived.  Eliminating the somatic component of Timestop post-v1.66 made it even more useful for armored arcanists than before.  Gotta scratch my head on why Bioware made that change. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I find most interesting is that PW designers seeking to balance their environment, rather than get involved making massive adjustments to balance factors like Timestop, simply eliminate them.  IMO that is a cheap solution that requires no imagination or creativity.  It's easy to get out a cleaver and start hacking out all the aspects of the game that seem inappropriate.  What remains when they do that, however, is a pale version of the original game.  For some, it must seem a reasonable tact, because many of those hacked-apart servers still have significant number of regular subscribers.  I also suspect there were many ppl who never really like the original game and its dynamics so migrated to those pseudo-NWN servers when they changed the game so drastically.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMHO you are appalled to the degree you are because clerics have no recourse against it as hard as they pray to their chosen deity to save them from it!   <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, morons cannot Timestop.  They require high intelligence (well, at least 19, anyways)... except those half-orc UMDers who find a TS scroll laying around and wonder \"Wut dis thing do?\".  UMD, another cheapness exploitable aspect limited to only a select few classes.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Time stop is not an epic spell that I can see    Now, I would have, not only returned, but made my own PW with PRC rules had there been a TIME STOP epic spell!  Of course, no one would want to play a server that would be designed for a lv 40 divine caster (lv 40.. you cant go over cuz it messes up the game), with Dev crit, Immune to Crits, epic mage armor (PRC is +20 ARMOR AC, not 5/5/5/5), Epic warding (absorbs 50/lvl or 2000 hp for 40 rounds), Storm Mantle, and the host of other stupid epic spells.. add Time stop... O M G!  <br/>\n<br/>\nPRC is VERY corruptable folks.  My RWOT on the mountain had a Wail with a DC of 54 or something ridiculous at lv 27 (too bad he couldnt True See a bloody thing).  Mix in the Dec critting dragon, the Tempest with Perfect two wpn fighting on kukris with DC 50 and 10 apr (how many times can you roll and not get a 1), and my favorite, the build that started it all off, the cleric/hospitaler CASTER with the inate AB of 52 for 4 apr (you should be able to ad +20 to that easily).  Maybe have some fun by adding in the DC50 Sorc I played around with, and yeah, no one would ever want to play that server.  Did I mention that, since all of these builds are casters with +21 class lvls, they ALL qualify for ALL epic spells (depending on spellcraft check and lore check), and thanks to the mountain, I would do a custom item craft system!  LOL  <br/>\n<br/>\nYeah.. not going to happen..  it would be divorce for sure, and only guys and gals like you would come to play!  LOL  Maybe not.  Like I said, PRC is ADDICTIVE!  Or maybe its just the POWER!  Muhahahahahahaahahaha<br/>\n<br/>\nbtw, I took a look at my old PRC outlines (i copied and stored them before everything went kaput).  I realized that, while they are PRC, I put in alot of what I was thinking about at the time, and the thougth process behind the builds.  I dont know if they would be at all helpful for the new players who are looking to learn (we all know that Maxi would just learn the PRC and rip apart the builds anyway   ).  There currently is no place to put them.  Maybe a new forum called \"LEARN TO BUILD\" or something (outside of Max's guide).<br/>\n<br/>\n*edit.. f&amp;ck...  Greater Time Stop...  2d4 rounds, which means that Clerics DO have time stop!

Kudos to all of you who made the quantum leap into PRC-ville.  I'm afraid it will be the next life for yurz troolie to venture into that community.  Took me 5 years to learn the basics of vanilla so, as you might deduce, my learning curve is fairly flat and degrading quickly with senility.  This is called \"holding on by one's fingernails\" in the literal sense. <br/>\n<br/>\nActually, we still play PnP 3.5 where Timestop has been modified significantly in regards to what the caster can do during the stopped period but has no effect on other members of the party if they are outside the AoE when it is cast.  IMO Teleport, though it is only a Level 5 arcane spell is far more unbalanced.  (TBH, I was somewhat disappointed that vanilla NWN didn't include Teleport as part of its standard wizard repertoire and have found no custom environment that has implemented it... but I digress... yet again).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's virtual hell for me trying to keep NWN rules separate from 3.5 and I must constantly check the wiki to remind myself of the NWN version.  So I suspect when one plays PRC they would need to stick with only that ruleset or get caught with the wrong version in their head during gameplay.  Dunno, but it seems taunting to me trying to play PRC and non-PRC servers in parallel. <br/>\n<br/>\n@Kail (or anyone else who knows this):  Does casting Timestop break the non-detection of Greater Sanctuary or Improved Invisibility on self?  I can't recall anymore.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It would be stupid to try to make a playable pw or mod, there is just too many stupid combos.  I know I mentioned it, but try to make a dev crit dragon WITH storm mantle (or another spell shield from the list) and greater time stop and Epic Warding... the only way would be to put the boss in an area where you couldnt spawn a dragon shape!  Regardless, the way he is made, ANY shape gets dev crit (creature), so you could use Elemental shape or Badger for crying out loud. <br/>\n<br/>\nPRC is literally a pissing contest for players who want power.
