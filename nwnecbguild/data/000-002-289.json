      "content": "<div>I created a new forum dedicated to game guides, by which I mean guides to the various aspects of the NWN game be them classes/PRCs, races, general character building, playing strategies, build types, spells and spell usage, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll are invited to take up the challenge to write up a guide, but those that do so are kindly asked to not underestimate the task and to make an effort to make the guide a useful resource for all that will read it. By this I mean to keep it well formatted, clear, to the point and to avoid unnecessary biases or specific environment references. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll questions, clarifications, suggestions and whatnot regarding the new forum, be pleased posted here in this thread.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you all.</div>"
