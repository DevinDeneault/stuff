      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">PROLOGUE:\u00a0 Not long ago someone asked me to make a HiPS, Red Dragon Disciple in these forums but it was not before i started skimming over my wheel of time books once more, that i remembered a guy named \"myrdraal\" that i decided to make a build based on one of these. The build could really work for any dextrous-type of character, i don't know if even Zorro had wings behind that black cloak of his, but you get my point. Now, I knew beforehand that this type of build has many (as a quick search in the old ecb will reveal) weaknesses so to say, such as very low AB, Hit points, Saves and so on and so i set my goal to be this: <em><strong>Make at least a playable version of it</strong></em> !<br/>\n<br/>\n THE PROBLEM: The problem is that currently i do not have the NwN 1, installed in my PC due to a recent format and hardware change (upgrade baby!) and the RDD complicates things with his stat changes (INT and CON in particular) so i cannot probably make an accurate version of it and post it. So i am asking your help here, in order to make it happen. Anyone with NwN 1 installed and a trainer like PGC3, or with Kamiryn's excel sheet can do it, but i also want something more. <em><strong>I want you to chime in and do your criticism about this build and propose the best way to do it</strong></em>. I will provide the fundamentals of the build and the reasons that lead me to that decision but after that i am open to any suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\n THE FUNDAMENTALS: The build is a (Bard 9/ RDD 15/ SD 16). It starts it's pre-epic life by going (Bard 8/ RDD 8/ SD 4) and then taking the next two RDD levels asap. The last Bard level comes at 40th level. It's starting attributes are: (STR 14\u00a0 DEX 18\u00a0 CON 12\u00a0 INT 12\u00a0 WIS 08\u00a0 CHA 12) and the final ones should be something like this: (STR 22\u00a0 DEX 32\u00a0 CON 14\u00a0 INT 14\u00a0 WIS 08\u00a0 CHA 14). Race is Elf obviously although you can do it with Halfling/ Human if you like. Final AB should be 40 as an Elf or 41 AB as a Hin if you go that route. Final AC with just clothes and a shield should be a superb 40 (dodge included) likewise and you will have Shadow Evade, HiPS and Epic Dodge on top of these as well. Damage will depend a lot from UMD and the weapons that you can find but thiis is true for most of the dextrous builds. Without any kind of buffs it should be (1D6 +6/ 15-20 X2) with a Rapier as your weapon of choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n FEATS Pre-Epic: Weapon Finesse, Blind Fight, Knockdown, Weapon Focus: Rapier, Improved Critical: Rapier, Dodge, Mobility,<br/>\n<br/>\n Feats Epic: Great dexterity IV, Epic Weapon Focus: Rapier, Epic Prowess, Armour Skin, Epic Fortitude, Epic Dodge, Epic Shadowlord/ Epic Skill Focus: Taunt (if enough skill points to maximize taunt),<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n And that's it really, i have one Strength-based version of it that it may-or-may not work better that i will post later, but let's say that it ends with a really good 43 AB and its AC is somewhere near 37 with just the plate and a shield. Of course it doesnt't have Epic Dodge xD<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Bardic arcane abilities offset this somewhat.<br/>\n Or, skip Taunt completely, and enjoy earlier UMD and the open bonus feat.\u00a0 Tough call -<br/>\n I like me some Taunt, but the feat and skill layout might be better without it, because then we<br/>\n can comfortably fit in Great Fort and Epic Shadowlord.<br/>\n<br/>\n In this version, I skipped Great Fort.\u00a0 Without it, Epic Dodge is 3 levels earlier, and you get<br/>\n both ESF:Taunt and the Epic Shadowlord.\u00a0 However, if you want it, take Great Dex<br/>\n at 30, and Great Fort at lvl 33 with Epic Dodge as the bonus feat.<br/>\n<br/>\n If one were to move RDD 10 (and its corresponding stat boosts) to lvl 29,<br/>\n you can get Epic Dodge at 27.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks Last Call,<br/>\n<br/>\n The build looks fine and you did well that you raised thhe starting INT to 14, even with that it still misses a few skill points that i would like, namely discipline but his AC will be so high that a 48 discipline would not cut it anyway. Apart from that, it is unfortunate that one cannot everything so i would cut the Shadowlord and add Epic Fortitude in there, he gains +9 to all his saves Vs spells but still with only 21 natural Fortitude i think this feat is mandatory in difficult PW's. I know for example that in WoG he would be toast from the wails, so except if the Epic Shadowlord summon is considerably more powerful than normal i would choose the Epic Fortitude each and every time. The Epic Skill Focus in Taunt has to remain as well since it is an almost guaranteed boost to his AB. Lastly i would take the skill points from Listen and put them in UMD (10 ranks) and Set Traps (4 ranks cc) in order to be able to use everything and set all deadly traps.<br/>\n<br/>\n Overall it seems a decent enough build, although it lacks somewhat on the offensive.<br/>\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n Here is the Strength version of it,<br/>\n<br/>\n (Human, Bard 11/ RDD 10/ SD 19)<br/>\n<br/>\n Starting Stats: (STR 15\u00a0 DEX 14\u00a0 CON 14\u00a0 INT 14\u00a0 WIS 08\u00a0 CHA 12)<br/>\n Ending Stats: (STR 36\u00a0 DEX 14\u00a0 CON 16\u00a0 INT 16\u00a0 WIS 08\u00a0 CHA 14)<br/>\n<br/>\n FEATS Pre-Epic: Heavy Armour, Weapon Proficiency: Exotic, Weapon Focus: Bastard Sword, Improved Critical: Bastard Sword, Blind Fight, Dodge, Mobility, Knockdown,<br/>\n FEATS Epic: Epic Weapon Focus: Bastard Sword, Epic Prowess, Armour Skin, Epic Fortitude, ESF: Taunt, ESF: Move Silently, ESF: Hide, Great Strength III,<br/>\n<br/>\n Expected Final AB is 42, Final AC is 37 (dodge included), HP's should be 422, Fortitude should be 26/ 35 (vs spells), and now he should have enough skill points to maximize Discipline (56), as well<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
