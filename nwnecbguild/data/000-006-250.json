      "content": "<div>Hail, mighty ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\n This build was a result of the discussions about a good PvP build for a high magic server. The idea was to make a guy with high AB and a high Devcrit DC that was able to withstand Devcrits (and spells) from other characters. His specialty is fighting melee types. They will likely not be able to Devcrit him while he will likely be able to do so. I wanted RDD 10 for the stat boni, and CoT for the saves. That left me with Bard or Sorcerer. Easy choice: Bard. The song will increase all your saves by 2 and reduce enemy saves by 2 with a well-placed Curse Song, which will make them more susceptible to your Devcrits. He will crit like a maniac with his self-keened Scimitar via UMD scrolls and hopefully have Haste as well due to the same weapon. He can't and shouldn't try to buff in combat, although\u00a0you have\u00a0Extend Spell, which you can replace it for Still Spell and voila! Combat buffing for you. Most of the time you should buff pre-combat, but if the PvP will happen unexpectedly, then you should be ready.<br/>\n<br/>\n The focus of this build is to outshine other melee builds and stand toe-to-toe with the best of them, and in that, Fire Immunity from RDD 10 really helps. You don't need to worry about those nasty Darkfires and Flame Weapons that your enemies may use against you. Critical Hit Immunity is a bit of a problem for you to deal with, but it generally comes with a lower AB, so with your 67 AC you should have the upper hand there too.<br/>\n<br/>\n Once per day, with Divine Wrath, you have a short duration GOD MODE. You will gain +7 AB and damage, and there's nothing you can't hit with that. However, only once a day and only for a short time, so don't rely on it. As a fighter, 45 AB is a relly good number for a base score. And you can self-buff, and you can debuff your enemies, so you don't need to worry about hitting even without DW. Epic Fortitude and Bard Song will help you resist most Devcrits and you should look for items to help you cap your CON and a 38 base STR will make your own Devcrit DC 50, which is not too shabby. You get Devcrit at level 24, which is pretty good. You could get it earlier by taking CoT levels earlier, but that would result in even fewer skill points, and they're already not enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n There are many builds with this class combo in the Search Engine, but most are from too long ago and they don't have the format that we use now, which makes them hard to read. The ones that I have seen and been able to understand end up at 42 AB, which is 3 points lower than this guy here. Most also go for Bard 20 for Lasting Inspiration, which becomes a problem because you'll need items or SF to sing the higher level song, and they have lower saves, and a lower Divine Wrath bonus as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n You can cap Spot\u00a0if you\u00a0remove a few points from Spellcraft. You should still be safe with your OK saves against spellcasters. And if you're willing, you can drop Armor Proficiency Heavy for IKD (rearranging some feats) if you can get DEX items too. A Chain Shirt only loses 1 AC compared to a Full Plate, and there's an Elven Chainmail that allows you to cast spells without failure. An overall TOUGH AS NAILS character that is surprisingly versatile and will do great PvM as well. As a matter of fact, I am not nearly an expert for PvP, but for PvM I know he'll be good!<br/>\n<br/>\n Ladies and Gents: The Draconic Duel Master<br/>\n<br/>\n Bard(16), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Champion of Torm(14), Human<br/>\n<br/>\n Alignment: any Non-lawful Non-evil<br/>\n<br/>\n Playability: 1-40 PvM, PvP<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 17 (38)<br/>\n DEX: 8<br/>\n CON: 14 (16)<br/>\n WIS: 8<br/>\n INT: 13 (15)<br/>\n CHA: 14 (16)<br/>\n<br/>\n Human: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n 01: Bard(1): Blind Fight, Armor Proficiency Heavy<br/>\n 02: Bard(2)<br/>\n 03: Bard(3): Weapon Focus: Morning Star<br/>\n 04: Bard(4): STR+1, (STR=18)<br/>\n 05: Bard(5)<br/>\n 06: Red Dragon Disciple(1): Knockdown<br/>\n 07: Red Dragon Disciple(2): (STR=20)<br/>\n 08: Red Dragon Disciple(3): STR+1, (STR=21)<br/>\n 09: Bard(6): Curse Song<br/>\n 10: Red Dragon Disciple(4): (STR=23)<br/>\n 11: Champion of Torm(1)<br/>\n 12: Bard(7): STR+1, Extend Spell, (STR=24)<br/>\n 13: Champion of Torm(2): Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br/>\n 14: Champion of Torm(3): {Smite Evil}<br/>\n 15: Champion of Torm(4): Improved Critical: Scimitar, Power Attack<br/>\n 16: Champion of Torm(5): STR+1, (STR=25)<br/>\n 17: Champion of Torm(6): Cleave<br/>\n 18: Bard(8): Lingering Song<br/>\n 19: Champion of Torm(7)<br/>\n 20: Champion of Torm(8): STR+1, Great Cleave, (STR=26)<br/>\n 21: Red Dragon Disciple(5): Overwhelming Critical: Scimitar<br/>\n 22: Red Dragon Disciple(6)<br/>\n 23: Red Dragon Disciple(7): (CON=16)<br/>\n 24: Red Dragon Disciple(8): STR+1, Devastating Critical: Scimitar, (STR=27)<br/>\n 25: Red Dragon Disciple(9): (INT=15) 26: Red Dragon Disciple(10): {Darkvision}, (STR=31), (CHA=16)<br/>\n 27: Bard(9): Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br/>\n 28: Bard(10): STR+1, (STR=32)<br/>\n 29: Bard(11)<br/>\n 30: Bard(12): Epic Fortitude<br/>\n 31: Bard(13)<br/>\n 32: Bard(14): STR+1, (STR=33)<br/>\n 33: Champion of Torm(9): Great Strength I, (STR=34)<br/>\n 34: Champion of Torm(10): Armor Skin<br/>\n 35: Champion of Torm(11)<br/>\n 36: Champion of Torm(12): STR+1, Great Strength II, (STR=36)<br/>\n 37: Bard(15)<br/>\n 38: Champion of Torm(13)<br/>\n 39: Champion of Torm(14): Great Strength III, Epic Prowess, (STR=37)<br/>\n 40: Bard(16): STR+1, (STR=38)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 440<br/>\n Skillpoints: 225<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 36/28/29<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9<br/>\n BAB: 27<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 45 (melee), 27 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 23/34<br/>\n Spell Casting: Bard(6)<br/>\n Alignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\n Discipline 43(57), Lore 8(26), Perform 27(30), Spellcraft 43(45), Spot 37(36), Tumble 40(39), UMD 27(30)<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Discipline(4), Lore(4), Perform(4), Spellcraft(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4),<br/>\n 02: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),<br/>\n 03: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),<br/>\n 04: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),<br/>\n 05: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),<br/>\n 06: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(2), 07: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(4),<br/>\n 08: Discipline(1), Save(7),<br/>\n 09: Discipline(1), Perform(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4),<br/>\n 10: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(2), Save(1), 11: Discipline(1), Save(4),<br/>\n 12: Discipline(1), Perform(3), Tumble(3), UMD(3),<br/>\n 13: Discipline(1), Save(3),<br/>\n 14: Discipline(1), Save(6),<br/>\n 15: Discipline(1), Save(9),<br/>\n 16: Discipline(1), Save(12),<br/>\n 17: Discipline(1), Save(15),<br/>\n 18: Discipline(1), Perform(6), Spellcraft(3), Tumble(5), UMD(6),<br/>\n 19: Discipline(1), Save(3),<br/>\n 20: Discipline(1), Save(6),<br/>\n 21: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(6), Save(3),<br/>\n 22: Discipline(1), Save(6),<br/>\n 23: Discipline(1), Save(9),<br/>\n 24: Discipline(1), Save(12),<br/>\n 25: Discipline(1), Save(15),<br/>\n 26: Discipline(1), Save(19),<br/>\n 27: Discipline(1), Perform(6), Tumble(10), UMD(6), Save(3),<br/>\n 28: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(4), Tumble(1), Save(4),<br/>\n 29: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(4), Tumble(1), Save(5),<br/>\n 30: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(4), Tumble(1), Save(6),<br/>\n 31: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(10),<br/>\n 32: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(14),<br/>\n 33: Discipline(1), Spot(18),<br/>\n 34: Discipline(1), Spot(4),<br/>\n 35: Discipline(1), Spot(4),<br/>\n 36: Discipline(1), Spot(2), Save(2),<br/>\n 37: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(3), Tumble(5),<br/>\n 38: Discipline(1), Spot(4),<br/>\n 39: Spot(5),<br/>\n 40: Discipline(2), Spellcraft(5),<br/>\n<br/>\n So, what do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\n EDIT: Added WF: Morning Star in place of Martial Weapon Proficiency as per Mick Dagger's suggestion.
