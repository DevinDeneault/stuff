      "content": "<div>This is a role-playing build that resembles the classic medieval knight. It's not the lawful good type but actually more the real part (thus part rogue) and uses charisma as a prime stat alongside strength of course. The build is made with the (AMIA PW) in mind, although it's value should apply to all modules since it is a classic class combo and it's strengths are well known by all. As for the build, all the known values are here, namely more combat options than you can count for, full tumble ranks and UMD, saves are in the stratosphere, damage is solid rock, armour class is as good as it gets e.t.c.<br/>\n And as for the Charisma value, you will find it surprisingly powerful since the 15th lvl of Divine Wrath in the limited 30 lvl environment is quite powerful, and it also serves both the role-playing aspect of the build and it's fun factor.<br/>\n<br/>\n1st Note:<br/>\n<br/>\n You can actually optimize one single stat in this build, namely the Dexterity from 12 to 8, in order to further enhance your Charisma or your Constitution score, but since this is a role playing build i choose not to do this. The option is there though and as we know getting to 12 Dexterity for optimal armour class in full plate is piece of cake in most environments. If you do this, i suggest you put your additional points into Charisma, especially if you play in AMIA PW, since this is also affects the duration of the powerful \"Purge The Infidel\" feat.<br/>\n<br/>\n2nd Note:<br/>\n<br/>\n As you see below, there are two Skiill Focus (SF) feats in the build that i have put them towards Discipline as befits a knight and UMD to get the 35 ranks for failure-less 9th lvl scroll-casting. In AMIA PW though it might be a good alternative to put those SF's into Craft: Armour and Craft: Weapon skills. If you do that, then modify your skills accordingly. There is a slight excess in skill points for exactly that reason<div align=\"center\"><span style=\"font-size:150%;line-height:normal\">Knight Of The Throne</span></div>\n<div align=\"center\"><span

      "content": "<div>Well, you must be doing something wrong then, because math does not lie.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me explain that in a more thorough way. The \"Knight of the Throne\" has an AB (attack bonus) of 36. Now, let's examine some other builds in that range. The \"Arelith Dwarven Elite Guard\" which is a weapon-master by the way, has also an AB of 36, the \"Arelith Barbarian\" which is a Barbarian-Fighter has an AB of 34, the \"Ghost\" which is a weapon-master with maximum human strength reaches 38 AB, and even your own \"Divine Smiter\" which is a level <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">forty </span>build and you said yourself that \"he is a full AB progression build, so his AB should be fine\" ends in 36 AB. I can find countless other examples from the old ECB archives for level thirty builds or from our own forum through builds we have made for Arelith/ AMIA/ Modules, but you get the idea of what I am saying.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's focus on your problem now and try to understand why is this happening. First thing is that you start as a rogue instead of a \"fighting\" class. Second thing is that you get your \"weapon focus\" on the third level. Lastly, you start with fifteen strength instead of sixteen for example. All of the above plus the relatively slow start of SoU seem to have contributed to your overall sluggish experience with the game. Understand though, that all of these had their purpose when we are talking about an optimized build, with the exception of lowish (starting) strength that is a result of the role-playing orientation of the build.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat can be done on such an occasion, from your part:<br/>\n<br/>\na) Quit playing the build and starting another more suited to your needs.<br/>\nb) Looking at the build first to understand it, then shift two points from dexterity to strength, in order to make it slightly stronger in the beginning.<br/>\nc) Simply keep playing and \"trust\" in the build to short itself out.<br/>\nd) Ask for a solution in the ECB forum, explaining your problem and the guys here,\u00a0myself included, will respond to you as soon as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat can be done to \"Fix\" the problem for those who want a stronger start and/or build out of this:<br/>\n<br/>\na) The solution is pretty simple if you read the preface of the build. Simply optimize your stats to look like this:<br/>\nStr17(28) Dex(8) Con(14) Int(13) Wis(8) Cha(14)<br/>\nThen change your feat order in the first levels to this:<br/>\n01) Fighter (01): Exotic Weapons, WF: Bastard Sword, Luck of Heroes<br/>\n02) Rogue (01):<br/>\n03) Fighter (02): Expertise, Knockdown<br/>\n...<br/>\nThe end result of these changes is that you will have to omit the Concentration skill (small loss) and some additional skill points (take from Spellcraft) but on the other hand you will start with a much stronger AB (+3) and end in a final 37 AB for the Knight of the Throne which puts him into the \"exceptional\" territory for a build of this kind. Should I were to extend the Knight to forty levels he would end up easily in 45 AB with Dev Critical on top of that. He is a strong build without a doubt.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, you have to understand that this is the internet and the medium does not convey the tone of your words, so you will have to be more thoughtful of your reactions/words. Posting in a \"threatening\" manner will get you nothing, no matter how \"frustrated\" you might be. In the end, I am doing this for free, wasting my own time, out of my love for the game and the fellow members of the ECB, I do not need responses like these.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hi Dingpot, <br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, if you have UMD on a build &amp; you play on WoG, it's better to just wear these nice boots from the Duergar mines (Azak-Zill?), there's literally no downside in doing that. The high discipline for AMIA PW was not specific but the craft focuses were. IIRC, in AMIA you also had better returns on your CoT levels, too. Back to WoG now, if I would go against something tough (including Drows), I would opt for immunity to KD because there's also that \"devastating\" Bigby's VI/VII (one of the two) that sits you on your butt &amp; ignores your discipline check. Of course, it can be done anyway, but you need beforehand knowledge, good reflexes &amp; a bit of luck, too. I remember doing the old Drow Wizards (the ones with real true sight 24/7 on) with just a pure Barbarian (TR, no dev-crit), but I had to time everything down to the last detail &amp; do a lot of corners-charge-IKD-drink invis pot, etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, a high discipline will do fine unless you are up against really tough opponents that will just start to spam IKD &amp; Bigby's on you, there it's better to be completely immune to that status effect since one mistake can mean you need to restart the whole thing again. And as for the build, I would change the two skill focusses for improved critical &amp; great cleave &amp; then go for devastating critical (early). <br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps ;)</div>"
