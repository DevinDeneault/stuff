EVERYONE.<br/>\n<br/>\n It would be to play PvM at first. Level Cap 30. I do not know which race gives the most advantages to the druids, elf? Druid main class, with no restrictions to complements. Melle, no. Ranged, yes. Weapons, I believe a bow. Spells, some buffs for the animal companion (preferably a Bear) and some good damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n I believe that is it.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I think it's worth the test anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n I think it would be good to ignore the use of weapons and focus only on the use of spells, strengthening the modifiers that I will most need.<br/>\n<br/>\n I liked the idea of being a Druid / Cleric.
