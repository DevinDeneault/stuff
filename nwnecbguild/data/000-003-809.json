      "content": "<div>I'm rolling through Aielund with Brother Maynard, Pastor of the Pointy Shafts. After a brief and unsuccessful gambit as the minister of auxiliary weaponry for an inept band of knights in the service of a horseless king, Brother Maynard found himself housebound in a backwater berg within the Kingdom of Aielund. Bereft of his beloved holy hand grenade, but Bent on pushing the one true religion on the undeserving people of Aielund, Brother Maynard seizes a bow, effortlessly (and one might add all too conveniently) joins forces with another tub-thumper who is couped up in the same inn, and then chides a cloddish ranger, who sounds as if he originates from America, before recruiting him. While the wilds of Aielund prove fraught with danger and our hero lacking in accuracy, Brother Maynard's depth of wisdom of the divine, eventually prevails, guiding his arrows toward their wicked targets.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd like some suggestions please :) What looks good. What looks bad? What I like is that the build is a decent archer with lots of spells and good AC. It certainly doesn't obtain the AB that Orion's\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Aelynthi, the Deadly\u00a0</span>\u00a0does.\u00a0<br/>\nA few thoughts of my own:\n<ul>\n<li>I thought about going for thirty tumble by investing in cross-class.\u00a0</li>\n<li>I like heal; I think it's valuable. Stag, you suggested once to take a pass on this. Reasons?</li>\n<li>I'd like more monk but not more Paladin. Is this a sound rationale?</li>\n<li>I figure that the investment into PwrAtk and 13 STR almost necessitates taking Divine shield but I'm not sure what to sacrifice.</li>\n<li>I took good and protection domains partly for RP but also, stoneskin has been really helpful and divine protection has been very useful for party support.</li>\n<li>I was thinking about improved crit Longbow but have opted instead for called shot. Or, should this be the feat slot to take DS? Wait, should I bother with DS?\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n\nAlso, where can you find the number of attacks per round in the CBC?\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAny comments/ suggestions appreciated.<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0<br/>\nCleric(35), Monk(3), Paladin(2), Human<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 13<br/>\nDEX: 13<br/>\nCON: 10<br/>\nWIS: 16 (36)<br/>\nINT: 10<br/>\nCHA: 14<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Monk(1): Point Blank Shot, Power Attack, {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}<br/>\n02: Paladin(1)<br/>\n03: Cleric(1): Divine Might, Domain Good, Domain Protection<br/>\n04: Cleric(2): WIS+1, (WIS=17)<br/>\n05: Cleric(3)<br/>\n06: Cleric(4): Zen Archery<br/>\n07: Monk(2): {Deflect Arrows}<br/>\n08: Cleric(5): WIS+1, (WIS=18)<br/>\n09: Cleric(6): Rapid Shot<br/>\n10: Paladin(2): {Smite Evil}<br/>\n11: Cleric(7)<br/>\n12: Cleric(8): WIS+1, Extend Spell, (WIS=19)<br/>\n13: Cleric(9)<br/>\n14: Cleric(10)<br/>\n15: Cleric(11): Weapon Focus: Longbow<br/>\n16: Cleric(12): WIS+1, (WIS=20)<br/>\n17: Monk(3): Monk Speed, Still Mind<br/>\n18: Cleric(13): Called Shot<br/>\n19: Cleric(14)<br/>\n20: Cleric(15): WIS+1, (WIS=21)<br/>\n21: Cleric(16): Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow<br/>\n22: Cleric(17)<br/>\n23: Cleric(18)<br/>\n24: Cleric(19): WIS+1, Epic Prowess, (WIS=22)<br/>\n25: Cleric(20)<br/>\n26: Cleric(21)<br/>\n27: Cleric(22): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=23)<br/>\n28: Cleric(23): WIS+1, Great Wisdom II, (WIS=25)<br/>\n29: Cleric(24)<br/>\n30: Cleric(25): Great Wisdom III, (WIS=26)<br/>\n31: Cleric(26): Great Wisdom IV, (WIS=27)<br/>\n32: Cleric(27): WIS+1, (WIS=28)<br/>\n33: Cleric(28): Great Wisdom V, (WIS=29)<br/>\n34: Cleric(29): Great Wisdom VI, (WIS=30)<br/>\n35: Cleric(30)<br/>\n36: Cleric(31): WIS+1, Great Wisdom VII, (WIS=32)<br/>\n37: Cleric(32): Great Wisdom VIII, (WIS=33)<br/>\n38: Cleric(33)<br/>\n39: Cleric(34): Great Wisdom IX, (WIS=34)<br/>\n40: Cleric(35): WIS+1, Great Wisdom X, (WIS=36)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 324<br/>\nSkillpoints: 141<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 27/37/21<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8, Mind Effects: +2<br/>\nBAB: 25<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 27 (melee), 42 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 28/28<br/>\nSpell Casting: Cleric(9)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nConcentration 42(42), Heal 39(52), Spellcraft 40(40), Tumble 20(21)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Concentration(4), Heal(4), Tumble(4), Save(8),\u00a0<br/>\n02: Concentration(1), Save(10),\u00a0<br/>\n03: Concentration(1), Save(12),\u00a0<br/>\n04: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(5), Save(8),\u00a0<br/>\n05: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Save(9),\u00a0<br/>\n06: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Save(10),\u00a0<br/>\n07: Concentration(1), Heal(3), Tumble(6), Save(5),\u00a0<br/>\n08: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(5), Save(1),\u00a0<br/>\n09: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Save(2),\u00a0<br/>\n10: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Save(3),\u00a0<br/>\n11: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Save(4),\u00a0<br/>\n12: Spellcraft(5), Save(2),\u00a0<br/>\n13: Save(5),\u00a0<br/>\n14: Concentration(1), Save(7),\u00a0<br/>\n15: Concentration(1), Save(9),\u00a0<br/>\n16: Concentration(1), Save(11),\u00a0<br/>\n17: Concentration(1), Tumble(10), Save(5),\u00a0<br/>\n18: Concentration(1), Heal(2), Spellcraft(5),\u00a0<br/>\n19: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Save(1),\u00a0<br/>\n20: Concentration(2), Heal(2),\u00a0<br/>\n21: Concentration(1), Save(2),\u00a0<br/>\n22: Spellcraft(5),\u00a0<br/>\n23: Concentration(2), Heal(1),\u00a0<br/>\n24: Concentration(1), Heal(2),\u00a0<br/>\n25: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Save(1),\u00a0<br/>\n26: Concentration(1), Save(3),\u00a0<br/>\n27: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5),\u00a0<br/>\n28: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Save(1),\u00a0<br/>\n29: Concentration(1), Heal(2), Save(1),\u00a0<br/>\n30: Concentration(1), Save(3),\u00a0<br/>\n31: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Save(4),\u00a0<br/>\n32: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(5),\u00a0<br/>\n33: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Save(1),\u00a0<br/>\n34: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Save(2),\u00a0<br/>\n35: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Save(3),\u00a0<br/>\n36: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Save(4),\u00a0<br/>\n37: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(5),\u00a0<br/>\n38: Concentration(1), Heal(2),\u00a0<br/>\n39: Concentration(1), Heal(2),\u00a0<br/>\n40: Concentration(1), Heal(2),\u00a0</div>"
