(hooray)<br/>\n<br/>\nStill has 43 AB but extra damage for a single handed wielder and extra strength for a dev critter is always nice<br/>\n<br/>\nAB 43 is right in the middle of the 'average warrior' on Mithdradates's AB scale but for a dwarven defender I'm not sure I can go much higher than that without dropping valuable epic damage reduction feats which were advocated by Thax'syllsia in his DD guide, anyway I think its enough AB to be playable<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso dropped improved knockdown, he'll just have to live with vanilla knockdown, which I'm sure he will be fine with for use against those overpowered spell slingers .<br/>\n<br/>\nDelightful side effect of 2d6 sneak attack, uncanny dodge, and more skill points in rogue and evasion pre-epic.<br/>\n<br/>\nTook Luck of Heroes for its synergy with evasion, was considering taking lightning reflexes or even resist energy fire/acid or something (its only 5/- though)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bonus epic damage reduction feats come a little later in the build dunno if I should be rushing them ahead of dev crit or the epic weapon focus/weapon specialisation feats, hitting things is important to be able to kill em if I'm solo<br/>\n<br/>\nJust curious if this guy equips a greater archer belt, against piercing would his DR be 24/- + 20/- = 44/-? I dont think it would but am curious, haven't made a DD before, but it would be pretty nice if it did, more DR than dragon shape yes please :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"font-size:150%;line-height:normal\">The Brutal Vanguard of Moradin</span></strong><br/>\n<br/>\nAny Lawful<br/>\n<br/>\nFighter(10), Rogue(4), Dwarven Defender(26), Dwarf<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 16 (30)<br/>\nDEX: 13<br/>\nCON: 19 (21)<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 10<br/>\nCHA: 6<br/>\n<br/>\nDwarf: (Darkvision, Defensive Training vs. Giants, Stonecunning, Hardiness vs. Poison, Hardiness vs. Spells, Offensive Training vs. Goblinoids, Offensive Training vs. Orcs, Skill Affinity: Lore)<br/>\n01: Rogue(1): Luck of Heroes<br/>\n02: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus (Scimitar)<br/>\n03: Fighter(2): Toughness, Dodge<br/>\n04: Fighter(3): CON+1, (CON=20)<br/>\n05: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialisation (Scimitar)<br/>\n06: Fighter(5): Power Attack<br/>\n07: Rogue(2): {Evasion}<br/>\n08: Fighter(6): STR+1, Knockdown, (STR=17)<br/>\n09: Dwarven Defender(1): Improved Critical (Scimitar), {Defensive Stance}<br/>\n10: Dwarven Defender(2): {Defensive Awareness I}<br/>\n11: Dwarven Defender(3)<br/>\n12: Dwarven Defender(4): STR+1, Blind Fight, (STR=18)<br/>\n13: Dwarven Defender(5)<br/>\n14: Dwarven Defender(6)<br/>\n15: Dwarven Defender(7): Cleave<br/>\n16: Dwarven Defender(8): STR+1, (STR=19)<br/>\n17: Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br/>\n18: Dwarven Defender(9): Great Cleave<br/>\n19: Dwarven Defender(10)<br/>\n20: Fighter(7): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n21: Fighter(8): Epic Weapon Focus (Scimitar), Epic Weapon Specialisation (Scimitar)<br/>\n22: Dwarven Defender(11)<br/>\n23: Dwarven Defender(12)<br/>\n24: Fighter(9): STR+1, Great Strength I, (STR=22)<br/>\n25: Dwarven Defender(13)<br/>\n26: Dwarven Defender(14): Epic Prowess<br/>\n27: Dwarven Defender(15): Great Strength II, (STR=23)<br/>\n28: Dwarven Defender(16): STR+1, (STR=24)<br/>\n29: Dwarven Defender(17)<br/>\n30: Dwarven Defender(18): Great Strength III, Overwhelming Critical (Scimitar), (STR=25)<br/>\n31: Fighter(10): Devastating Critical (Scimitar)<br/>\n32: Dwarven Defender(19): STR+1, (STR=26)<br/>\n33: Dwarven Defender(20): Great Constitution I, (CON=21)<br/>\n34: Dwarven Defender(21)<br/>\n35: Dwarven Defender(22): Epic Damage Reduction I<br/>\n36: Dwarven Defender(23): STR+1, Great Strength IV, (STR=28)<br/>\n37: Rogue(4)<br/>\n38: Dwarven Defender(24)<br/>\n39: Dwarven Defender(25): Great Strength V, (STR=29)<br/>\n40: Dwarven Defender(26): STR+1, Epic Damage Reduction II, (STR=30)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 676<br/>\nSkillpoints: 128<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 29/20/20<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +2, Traps: +1, Poison: +2<br/>\nBAB: 29<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 43 (melee), 31 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 19/30<br/>\nSpell Casting:\u00a0<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscipline 43(53), Search 10(10), Tumble 40(41), UMD 35(33)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Search(4), Save(28),\u00a0<br/>\n02: Discipline(5), Save(25),\u00a0<br/>\n03: Discipline(1), Save(26),\u00a0<br/>\n04: Discipline(1), Save(27),\u00a0<br/>\n05: Discipline(1), Save(28),\u00a0<br/>\n06: Discipline(1), Save(29),\u00a0<br/>\n07: Search(6), Tumble(10), UMD(10), Save(11),\u00a0<br/>\n08: Discipline(2), Save(11),\u00a0<br/>\n09: Discipline(1), Save(12),\u00a0<br/>\n10: Discipline(1), Save(13),\u00a0<br/>\n11: Discipline(1), Save(14),\u00a0<br/>\n12: Discipline(1), Save(15),\u00a0<br/>\n13: Discipline(1), Save(16),\u00a0<br/>\n14: Discipline(1), Save(17),\u00a0<br/>\n15: Discipline(1), Save(18),\u00a0<br/>\n16: Discipline(1), Save(19),\u00a0<br/>\n17: Tumble(10), UMD(10), Save(7),\u00a0<br/>\n18: Discipline(2), Save(7),\u00a0<br/>\n19: Discipline(1), Save(8),\u00a0<br/>\n20: Discipline(1), Save(9),\u00a0<br/>\n21: Discipline(1), Save(10),\u00a0<br/>\n22: Discipline(1), Save(11),\u00a0<br/>\n23: Discipline(1), Save(12),\u00a0<br/>\n24: Discipline(1), Save(13),\u00a0<br/>\n25: Discipline(1), Save(14),\u00a0<br/>\n26: Discipline(1), Save(15),\u00a0<br/>\n27: Discipline(1), Save(16),\u00a0<br/>\n28: Discipline(1), Save(17),\u00a0<br/>\n29: Discipline(1), Save(18),\u00a0<br/>\n30: Discipline(1), Save(19),\u00a0<br/>\n31: Discipline(1), Save(20),\u00a0<br/>\n32: Discipline(1), Save(21),\u00a0<br/>\n33: Discipline(1), Save(22),\u00a0<br/>\n34: Discipline(1), Save(23),\u00a0<br/>\n35: Save(25),\u00a0<br/>\n36: Save(27),\u00a0<br/>\n37: Tumble(20), UMD(15),\u00a0<br/>\n38: Discipline(2),\u00a0<br/>\n39: Discipline(2),\u00a0<br/>\n40: Discipline(2),\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I'll have a proper look later if that's alright. In the meantime, just a couple of things...<br/>\n<br/>\nYou mention Uncanny Dodge: it's pointless here. Four levels earlier than you take Rogue 3 you have DwD 5, which gives you it's big brother - Defensive Awareness II, which means you can't be flanked in combat, thus immune to sneaks while you're fighting, even if you're not fighting the sneaker. If you had enough skill points to go round, I'd really like to see Listen here so you couldn't be surprised by a lone assailant. It might even be preferable to UMD (I know - sacrilege!).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question more broadly is about the focus of the build. Tanks, by their very nature, tank <em>for</em> something, so are particularly valuable in party-play, allowing the squishier members to bombard, sneak, etc. Solo, it's harder, because effectively you're distracting enemies from attacking...you. Which is difficult. Yes, you can get Dev Crit, but the DC isn't going to be that high, so might be questionable at later levels. There's a clue in the name: Dwarven <em>Defender</em>. This means battles of attrition, not blitzes. It's a class not born for one-hit wonders. Myself, I'd be tempted to drop STR back to 28 - losing 2 Great Strengths - for Armour Skin and EDR III: worth more imho.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just thoughts. I'll be back later...<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Getting Dev Crit and high AB as the goals. Armor Skin and EDR for 2 Str is a hard one I agree. I'm not too fussed with armor skin given he will be going sword and board, but the EDR III would be nice. Wonder if I can keep Str 30 and add one more EDR. I'd probably have to drop something useful though. Probably EP. Not sure how I feel about that. 1 AB = 5% chance to hit and crit...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Its certainly a bit of a beast<br/>\nOr maybe he just has so many awesome builds hes just forgotten about it with the Andariels Moghediens etc<br/>\n<br/>\nIt shares a lot of features with my own.

Similar focus to get a good AB<br/>\nLooks like I trade Int 13, DR 27 and Cons 22 for Int 10, DR 24, Str 30 and Dev Crit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end I'm happy with what I've made, a Str 30 dev crit 43 AB dwarven defender with DR 24 and nearly 700 hp and UMD, evasion, 2d6 sneak attack max tumble max discipline UMD<br/>\n<br/>\nLooks like a build I'm ready to play<br/>\n<br/>\nI've tried dropping dev crit to get the AB even higher, but the highest Str I could get with DR 21+ was 31<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks guys for your help. I'll probably start play testing this guy soon. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way you will notice a lot of Mithdradates and Grizzled Dwarflords STR builds will feature devastating critical - I have followed such a fashion.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Max is in good company<br/>\n<br/>\nBut some players prefer not to take the feat and thats fine, its all a matter of taste, I'll post the most powerful build that I can think of, then others can modify according to taste if they desire :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That, and I don't like being a one-trick pony. When that build is pretty close to complete, then I'll ask whether Dev Crit would bring more than I'd lose by sacrificing at least 3, and possibly 5 or more feats.

Hope you don't mind, Orion.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, unless the Guild is specifically told about a particular environment wherein certain feats or skills are inappropriate when constructing a build, we build the best we can for the standard environment, so recommending that a build doesn't take any given skill or feat purely on the basis of one PW or module and the items available there isn't terribly helpful. Such things can be added as potential tweaks as an addendum to the build, as they are regarding Discipline in this case.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, could we all please stop shouting at each other? I am aware we can capitalize words and put them in bold or italics for emphasis, and even expand the point size of letters, but we are not idiots, and bellowing what one has to say doesn't actually make it any more attractive to read.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know I'm coming over all grumpy here, but come on, people, we should know this by now.

If you've gotten to the stage that you are actually writing I'm coming across all grumpy here, that should be a immediate warning sign that something is not right with what you are about to post! :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI blame the excessive Stag in a dress / Stag the spell caster slayer postings for altering a usually well natured individual to Mr Grumpy but I'm no mind reader, and sometimes real life does get to you too.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSuch postings are really a sign of affection towards you to be honest.

Where did that Stag go?<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscipline:<br/>\n- If you read my comment carefully, I wrote it would work fine in other environments. I've tried to follow ECB protocol which is to not post builds that are specific for an environment. Hence Discipline is generally good to skill in this build.\u00a0<br/>\n- The comment I made was directed at myself not the ECB or anyone else, it was a self-criticism of not being aware of my usual play style of wearing knockdown immune gear. As such I could have maxed Listen instead.<br/>\n- it was also shared with the forum because it was something I discovered as I was playing (play testing experience -&gt; can lead to build tweaks, purpose of the comment)<br/>\n<br/>\nShouting:<br/>\n- I was educated that putting things in Caps is shouting on the internet. If it is defined this way I'm not particularly guilty of such a thing<br/>\n- The font size changes were designed to make it dramatic and interesting. like how a story teller embellishes a tale to make it interesting.

Damage output is good. When criticals proc (and they proc often) its heavenly, and devastating critical is very nice against minions, particularly rogue and wizard types who are super annoying.<br/>\n<br/>\nHP around 680. DR is 12/- plus other sources. Using the belt swap trick Valerfor mentioned DR is around 30/- against selected types (ie slashing, piercing) which is just lovely to tank. Tower shield was a good decision as it reduces the number of critical hits I receive (which can penetrate my DR). Add improved invisibility for 50% concealment from UMD, and a little regeneration, and a ring of elemental resistance, and he can manfight for a very long time.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nDR enemies are a problem but I think thats common for anyone using non two handed. For those who are critical vulnerable, criticals and devastating critical helps a lot.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nUMD solves a lot of problems, particularly mind affecting abilities, using a scroll of lesser mind blank or mind blank is very handy for mindflayers and undead types with fear auras.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
