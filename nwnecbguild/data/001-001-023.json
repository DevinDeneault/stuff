What are your experiences with it, if so?<br/>\n<br/>\nI remmeber I downloaded it and gave it a short try many years ago, but it was at a a time that I stopped playing NWN. I later lost all saves, modules, characters, etc. I had and was considering downloading it again. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm guessing it's good for characters you use on the reg, but it seems that most of you play different characters for different modules. I also didn't found a reference to it on this forums.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Still, you can read the comments from the old Vault to get an idea what is like. I remember I used I for a while but that was a decade ago... <br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"ftp://neverwintervault.org/rolovault/projects/nwn1/modules/3723/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ftp://neverwintervault.org/rolovault/pr ... index.html</a><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
