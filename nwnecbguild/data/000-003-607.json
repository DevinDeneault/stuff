But I am interested to know if HiPS is useful as I have died using GDL's damage shield strategy when I have run out of appropriate cure/healing potions and got mobbed. In my mind, HiPS could be used to reposition if invisibility wands/potions are not enough. Palemaster gets stealth abilities as a class skill, so I thought it might be nice to see if this could work well.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does have uncanny dodge and tumble 40 which is a little unhelpful for the damage shield strategy but tumble/dodge AC will be removed by clearing the action queue, not sure if it is also removed by drinking potions. Mobility is probably a bigger problem, providing +4 AC against attacks of opportunity. I think though there will be ways around it to keep the AC low enough so one can be hit often enough when the shields are up and you have enough healing potions.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a higher AC strategy is desired, uncanny dodge, dodge, tumble AC and mobility will be extremely helpful for tanking purposes.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Illusionist(26), Pale Master(10), Shadowdancer(4), Dwarf [gnome is good too, better stealth/detection, loses 2 str]\nPvM 1-40, low to mid magic\nSTR: 10\nCON: 18 (24)\nINT: 17 (24)\n\n01: Illusionist(1): Dodge, {Scribe Scroll}\n03: Illusionist(3): Extend Spell\n05: Illusionist(5): Craft Wand\n07: Pale Master(1)\n09: Illusionist(7): Empower Spell\n11: Illusionist(9)\n13: Illusionist(11)\n15: Illusionist(13): Greater Spell Penetration\n17: Shadowdancer(2): {Evasion, Uncanny Dodge I}\n19: Pale Master(3)\n21: Illusionist(15): Epic Skill Focus: Concentration, Epic Spell Penetration\n23: Pale Master(6)\n25: Pale Master(8)\n27: Pale Master(10): Epic Damage Reduction II\n29: Illusionist(17)\n31: Illusionist(19)\n33: Illusionist(21): Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor\n35: Illusionist(22)\n37: Illusionist(24)\n39: Illusionist(26): Great Intelligence II, Great Intelligence III, (INT=24)\n\nSkillpoints: 306\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +11, Poison: +2\nAB (max, naked): 20 (melee), 21 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Wizard(9)\n\n\n01: Concentration(4), Disable Trap(1), Lore(4), Open Lock(1), Set Trap(1), Spellcraft(2), Save(4),\u00a0\n03: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Save(10),\u00a0\n05: Lore(1), Save(19),\u00a0\n07: Hide(10), Listen(3), Move Silently(8), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n09: Concentration(5), Save(1),\u00a0\n11: Concentration(1), Save(11),\u00a0\n13: Concentration(1), Save(23),\u00a0\n15: Concentration(1), Save(35),\u00a0\n17: Hide(9), Listen(14), Move Silently(10), Search(4), Tumble(15),\u00a0\n19: Concentration(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Spellcraft(3),\u00a0\n21: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(6),\u00a0\n23: Concentration(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Spellcraft(3),\u00a0\n25: Concentration(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Spellcraft(3),\u00a0\n27: Concentration(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Spellcraft(2), Save(1),\u00a0\n29: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(11),\u00a0\n31: Spellcraft(1), Save(22),\u00a0\n33: Save(37),\u00a0\n35: Concentration(5), Spellcraft(3),\u00a0\n37: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(11),\u00a0\n39: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(23),\u00a0</details>\n\nOther W/PM 10/SD builds in the archives:<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build217784.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Shadowmancer</a><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build210513.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Magical Mystical Skeletal Shadowdancer Dude</a><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build215254.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Waagh the Goblin</a><br/><br/></details>\n<br/>\nOne other thought I had was spell penetration feats + crafted magic. Do they increase spell penetration rolls if crafted magic is used against an enemy? ie a wand of ILMS (13) might have SP 19 +1d20 with epic spell penetration (+6)?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It's one of the several underwhelming aspects of the default magic crafting. Crafting costs, random wand charges, and pre-set caster levels fall into the same category.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a side note, invisibility and hide unsurely overlap. With invisibility/improved invisibility, you've got the hide half of stealth covered for most circumstances (see invisibility a notable exception), but using silence to cover the silent part in painful in a wizard build. Personal preference, I would likely change the ESF: Hide for a Spell Focus, but that's a different topic and ESF: MS fits well with the build them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, another excellent build with a plethora of tools to handle any situation.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
