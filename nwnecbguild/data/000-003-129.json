Hips is nerfed and there is no Dev critical.<br/>\n<br/>\n i'm looking to make a decision based human monk (high ac) preferred unarmed as max on weapons is a +3. Would consider kamas is all good. He will be an evil character.<br/>\n<br/>\n could use the help!</div>"

They're currently doing something else (life, eh, just gets in the way), but will doubtless be back soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n In the meantime, have a look around the Guild - there's a huge amount of stuff here. I've been a member for nearly 2 years and have barely scratched the surface of NwN's potential. Maximillian Kane's Guide to Playing Better was certainly an eye-opener for me (it's in the Game Guides subforum).<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers</div>",
