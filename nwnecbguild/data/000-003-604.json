This is a relatively low strength build that only gets access to Dev Crit late; is it still worth it? Are there other bonus feats that should be taken instead? Not taking Dev Crit probably also frees up Cleave and Great Cleave for other selections as well - maybe Toughness and something else. Dropping Dev Crit could potentially allow for picking up exotic weapons and switching to Bastard Sword or Katana.</li>\n<li>Scimitar vs Longsword? This may tie into the question above about Dev Crit; Scimitar has better threat range but lower damage (1d6 compared to longsword 1d8); the forge in HoTU probably makes either choice usable. I went with longsword as the baseline because I remember more themed longswords in SoU and HoTU than scimitars.</li>\n<li>Skill split between Listen and UMD; are there any targets that I should aim for for equipping items in HoTU or SoF? If I recall correctly there weren't many (any?) enemies that used stealth in the original campaigns but I'm unsure on SoF. I was thinking 34 UMD is needed for level 9 scrolls. The base CHA modifier will give +5; if capped CHA with items/self-buffs then it would be +11.</li>\n<li>Should those last 2 points in CHA go to STR instead? I was thinking CHA improves UMD modifier, Taunt modifier, Divine Shield (+1 dodge ac) and Divine Might (+1 dmg) and duration, Divine Wrath duration, and +1 all saves from Divine Grace; STR would add Disc modifier, +1 AB, +1 dmg, and +1 DC to Dev Crit.</li>\n<li>Is it worth putting any points into Search given the modules being played?

Given the nature of module play, taking Devastating Critical just prior to level 40 really devalues the level of investment required to get there.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I would pull all Charisma enhancement, Epic Prowess and Armour skin out of the early epic level build (unless a class bonus feat requires a selection) and focus on pulling in Great Strength, Overwhelming Critical and Devastating Critical in the early epic levels.  As early as you can get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have access to Divine Shield/Might early, an extra round(s) pales in mechanical advantage/power compared to Devastating Critical.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019ll also add, this is a strong build, one of the mechanically strongest offence/defence balanced builds possible.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">For your questions, sorry answering on an iPad which makes screen space and switching painful so will update in stages.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Divine Wrath is a once per day ability, I would discard it over the other two options.  On a persistent world with level 40 play, the strongest mechanical advantage would be 24 paladin for dispels resistance.  On a module however, the strongest mechanical advantage is the rogue level.  It is the strongest not for the reasons you listed but because it allows an additional rogue level dip during the build to take advantage of UMD and tumble as the build progresses rather than right at the end of the build when the module finishes.  Uncanny Dodge would be a strong mechanical advantage on a Dex build, but on a heavy Armor, strength build it sits in the \u201cnice to have if nothing else offers much\u201d category.<br/>\n2. Dev Crit is absolutely worth getting, it is possibly the strongest feat in the game.  It is considered game breaking on most persistent worlds.  With a deep CoT build, you have feats to spare so not even a feat starved approach.  On a deep CoT/Paladin build all the \u201csave\u201d feats become much less interesting.  You need to adjust your build to pull it back as far as possible into your early epics.  I would shift EVERY feat that is not direct path to DevCrit out to later in the build and focus on getting the Great Strength as early as possible to net Overwhelming Critical and DevCrit.  Then prioritise Epic Weapon Focus &gt; Armour Skin &gt; Weapon Prowess &gt; Great Charisma.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe only downside here is that a Paladin build has lots of stat requirements, DevCrit shines with a deep Strength commitment.  You have the possibility of a deep Strength commitment here using CoT but it comes at a Charisma tradeoff.  So the other option would be to drop Divine Shield/Might (or keep it and live with the lower duration), leave your Charisma at 14 and double down on Great Strength and +Strength to max out your Dev Crit capability (I would probably take the +6 Strength and keep the Divine Feats).<br/>\n<br/>\n3. All things remaining equal Scimitar for DevCrit.  However, you really need someone with module knowledge to lean in.  This build, regardless of weapon selection will utterly decimate module play, likely to the level of boredom.  Having a decent weapon selection/progression is likely worth dipping into another weapon if there are better module options.<br/>\n4. Drop your Con by 2 and bump your Int by 2.  A Paladin/CoT build has lots of damage/save mitigation opportunities and the extra Skill Points are worth more than the Extra HP in my opinion.   However, remember that a Paladin should be able to cap Charisma (+12) pretty easily/quickly netting Aura of Glory and Eagle\u2019s Splendour for +9 whilst still capping Str and likely Con.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I like the class split, great synergy with the saves + evasion. I don't see much point in changing it, although I must confess I rarely use Divine Wrath, that might be a reason to go for CoT 15 if this is desirable. I agree with Zanithar usually I prefer Str over Cha for my melee paladins in terms of power. With CoT 14 your saves will be fabulous I'm sure, I'd probably take points away from Cha into Str.<br/>\n<br/>\nUMD you will want at modified 5 intervals (ie 30, 35, 40 etc), the exception being having no failure using up to lvl 9 scrolls, this is obtained at lvl 33. The amount of UMD depends on the value of the magical items you want to use. The higher the magic environment, the higher the UMD modified that is desirable. UMD 40 modified for example should cover all items up to value of 1 million, although I would be tempted to go further, those familiar with the environments can comment in a more expert fashion, I do recall at least +9 weapons being available in HoTU. There is a table in the NWN Wiki to help. I also got the data and prepared a summary of enchantment + value using one of the character creation modules called PGCC, you can see a +10 longsword has a value over 1 million GP so UMD 45-50 might even be attractive.

If you go one up from Normal, then you only get the gear you have equipped. And if you go on hardest difficulty you go without anything. So it's worth starting at Normal - you can always adjust it once you're in play. Second, you'll want some serious fire resistance for your character for the first module - particularly if you're planning on travelling in armour, helm and shield - as you will cook in the heat of the desert and take constant fire damage. Third, it's worth getting some acid damage put on your weapon by Rizolver in HotU for dealing with the desert folk. Also worth taking some ranged ammo with fire or cold damage for assorted slimes. EDIT: Oh, almost forgot, there are a fair amount of nasty traps in SoF, so I'd say some Search and Disable Traps would be worthwhile. On that basis I'd probably go for the extra level of Rogue, for both the extra skills and ease of levelling. Either that or buy a lens of detection when in HotU.\n</details>\n\nAs for the build itself, you receive some wise counsel from others above, and I'm not qualified to pontificate on pallies.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'm also going to make the changes to pick up the extra rogue level pre-epic to help smooth out leveling (comes with the added benefit of getting evasion much sooner) and switch around the skills based on the comments about Spot and Search in SoF and the SoF traps. Going to stick with longsword since there are more options while leveling (the build should be strong enough that the extra crit chance of scim is probably not needed - but scim would be better for PW play; but this is a module run). I did some quick testing with the UMD thresholds and 35 seemed ok to end at; the 10 UMD at level 7 is enough to wear up to +3 Sun Soul boots to help get an extra AC boost early. Swapped Listen for Spot for SoF feedback; dropped Taunt for some Open Lock and Disable Trap skills. I'll wait and see how it goes to see if I need to swap more CHA for STR.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladin (23), CoT(14), Rogue(3)<br/>\nHuman, Lawful Good<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 15 (28)<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 12<br/>\nWIS: 14<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 14 (18)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Paladin(1): Power Attack, Weapon Focus: Longsword<br/>\n02: Paladin(2): {Smite Evil}<br/>\n03: Paladin(3): Knockdown<br/>\n04: Paladin(4): STR+1, (STR=16)<br/>\n05: Paladin(5)<br/>\n06: Paladin(6): Extend Spell<br/>\n07: Rogue(1): {Sneak attack 1d6}<br/>\n08: Paladin(7): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n09: Paladin(8): Divine Might<br/>\n10: Paladin(9)<br/>\n11: Paladin(10)<br/>\n12: Paladin(11): STR+1, Divine Shield, (STR=18)<br/>\n13: Paladin(12)<br/>\n14: Paladin(13)<br/>\n15: Paladin(14): Blind Fight<br/>\n16: Champion of Torm(1): STR+1, (STR=19)<br/>\n17: Champion of Torm(2): Improved Critical: Longsword<br/>\n18: Champion of Torm(3): Cleave<br/>\n19: Champion of Torm(4): Great Cleave<br/>\n20: Champion of Torm(5): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n21: Champion of Torm(6): Great Strength I, Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword, (STR=21)<br/>\n22: Rogue(2): {evasion}<br/>\n23: Paladin(15)<br/>\n24: Champion of Torm(7): STR+1, Great Strength II, (STR=23)<br/>\n25: Champion of Torm(8): Overwhelming Critical<br/>\n26: Champion of Torm(9)<br/>\n27: Paladin(16): Great Strength III, (STR=24)<br/>\n28: Champion of Torm(10): STR+1, Devastating Critical, (STR=25)<br/>\n29: Champion of Torm(11)<br/>\n30: Champion of Torm(12): Great Charisma I, (CHA=15)<br/>\n31: Champion of Torm(13)<br/>\n32: Champion of Torm(14): STR+1, Epic Prowess, (STR=26)<br/>\n33: Paladin(17): Great Charisma II, (CHA=16)<br/>\n34: Paladin(18)<br/>\n35: Paladin(19)<br/>\n36: Paladin(20): STR+1, Great Strength IV, (STR=28)<br/>\n37: Paladin(21)<br/>\n38: Paladin(22)<br/>\n39: Rogue(3): {uncanny dodge I, sneak attack 2d6}, Great Charisma III, (CHA=17)<br/>\n40: Paladin(23): CHA+1, Armor Skin, (CHA=18)<br/>\n<br/>\nSkills (233):<br/>\nDisc 43 (52)<br/>\nTumble 40 (39)<br/>\nUMD 35 (39)<br/>\nSpot 35 (37)<br/>\nSearch 33 (35)<br/>\nDisable Trap 27 (29)<br/>\nOpen Lock 20 (19)<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
