That is believing in something without fully understanding!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I took faith in my ECB colleague and redid the build and\u00a0 this is what it looks like as a elven wizard AA paladin, it has 1 less AB, but gets 140 more skill points\u00a0 which can be used to pump a number of skills up nicely plus the glorious keen senses... it certainly looks a <strong>LOT</strong> stronger... plus a lot of modules will have elf special things available to them... just the spell DCs will be lower which may or may not be important...<br/>\n<br/>\nI even included taunt (lol) in case that is useful whilst you are in iron golem or red dragon form with the Shapechange spell...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks so much again.

On other servers one could cast Bull's Strength or Eagle's splendor for extra Str damage from mighty / Divine damage. Boots of Traveling allow for some very cheesy outdoor kiting strategies against melee opponents. If you can't hit them there is always a wand of missiles. I think hitting them will no longer be a problem once the Arcane Archer levels get pumped up a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nWill continue play testing, I have a feeling this will be quite a nice build to play and things will only get better once the sorcerer levels get pumped up further epic levels.\u00a0</div>"
