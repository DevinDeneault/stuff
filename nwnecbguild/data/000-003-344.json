      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hey, I like the way you build monks that are good at doing monk things   <br/>\n<br/>\nStunning fist DC 42 looks sharp.<br/>\nQP DC 36 is not shabby.<br/>\nAB +38 is perhaps a bit on the low side, but that of course depends on what you are up against where you play.<br/>\n7 attacks/round with FoB means 3 attacks in flurry 1, incrasing the chance to actually hit and force a roll with your special attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have some comments on your skill selection.<br/>\nUMD 31 (30) ends on a fine rounded number dividable by 5, perfect for magical gear. If you want to make sure that you can cast from scrolls with guaranteed 100% success, you will need UMD 34 (33). That will ensure a minimum roll of 1+33=34 just enough for level 9 spells DC: 25+9=34. You only need 3 ranks more.<br/>\nI also wonder why you take Disable traps 15 (15). Dt is a take 20 skill. The DCs for deadly traps are 22, 26, 31 and 36, requiring a modified skill of 2, 6, 11 or 16. It only costs you one more skill point to be able to handle the most difficult ones.<br/>\nThere seems to be a mismatch between nearly being able to disable all deadly traps and having no ranks in seach and an intelligence of 10. The search DCs for deadly traps are 10, 14, 18 and 22. Search is not a take 20 skill. You get a smal racial bonus to search from elf, but even so most of the time you will need many rounds before you are able to detect the more difficult deadly traps with DC 18 and 22.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Leftovers can go to open locks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo first things first let's do the skills. <br/>\n<br/>\nMove Silently: 43 (53)<br/>\nHide: 43 (53)<br/>\nUMD: 36 (35)<br/>\nTumble: 40 (49)<br/>\nOpen Locks: 14 (22)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo better stealth, UMD &amp; Open locks at the cost of an immature Disable traps. Looks better in my eyes too now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondary thing is the AB, i can see that i can harvest 1 more point by going DEX 28/ WIS 20 and dropping the Stunning Fist DC by one point. I think it is worth it for 1 more AB right?<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps is there a way to get AS too and reach a 40 AC with just a t-shirt, perhaps not.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaye i should look into a Monk 30/ FTR 4/ CoT 6 combo for getting better numbers?<br/>\n<br/>\nAB 40, AC 40 &amp; SR 40 would be very nice if i were not to drop below (also) 40 the DC of the stunning fist. What do you say?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the suggestions!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Well, I wasn't going to say anything, but you made the noob mistake of taking Epic Prowess before Epic Weapon Focus. Swap them around!<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand what you're going for in this build, but I have to say I would make him a STR build. As it sits, there is no reason for you to go DEX except MAYBE a higher AC, but if you are forfeiting Epic Dodge by not taking Rogue to at least 10, maybe you should reconsider the whole thing. Basically, what I mean is:<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go for 30 / 6 / 4, I think it'd be better as a Strength build. You run FAST AS HELL, so AC isn't that much of a concern (I know, except for WoG bosses ), go for broke and make him damage things A LOT.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think for a DEX build, you may want to aim at getting Epic Dodge with something like Monk 20 Fighter 10 Rogue 10. That build would get 3 Fighter bonus feats in epics, which could be AS, EWF and EWS, then you could take Epic Dodge on a general feat and time your Monk levels to take some Monk feats as general feats, but you'd be missing a couple of Monk bonus feats (to make up for that you'd have more general feats for free).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that's just my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Not really a Legenary Master with 20 levels only eh? Not to mention that with this split you get mind immunity and empty body at the very end.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do know this build is hard as nuts to do, so many things to attent. Good SR, Good AB, Good AC, Good DC and whatever else.. It makes your mind hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would go STR - based in a pinch if it wasn't for that 19 DEX requirement.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe a 25/5/10 with ED &amp; EWS but he will be even more tight on feats. Can't be done i think while maintaining ISF.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill something good came out from this, EWF first! That's an improvement (and shows how much forgotten this build was heh).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think about the +1 AB Vs +1 DC debate? Although i know you would prefer the former as i do in this case. Mick also said the AB was kind of low.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway thanks for the input man!
