      "content": "<div>Hey guys,<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm trying to build out a melee mage concept and would like your help. I've read HipMaestro's melee mage thread and thought it sounded like a lot of fun. The server I'm trying to build for is Anphillia:\u00a0<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://anphillia.pw/w/index.php/Mechanics_changes\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://anphillia.pw/w/index.php/Mechanics_changes</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe level cap is 16, and the server itself is pretty difficult. Rest times are once every 20-30 minutes I think so that might make things<br/>\ntricky at earlier levels, but most of the time you're playing with team mates so I can fall back as a buffbot / support character.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, here is what I have so far:<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman Wizard<br/>\n<br/>\nIllusionist 16<br/>\n<br/>\nStr: 16<br/>\nDex: 12<br/>\nCon: 14<br/>\nInt: 16 (20)<br/>\nWis: 8<br/>\nCha: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Illusionist: Martial Weapon Proficiency, Toughness<br/>\n02: Illusionist\u00a0<br/>\n03: Illusionist: Blind Fight<br/>\n04: Illusionist\u00a0<br/>\n05: Illusionist: Extend Spell<br/>\n06: Illusionist:\u00a0 Knockdown<br/>\n07: Illusionist\u00a0<br/>\n08: Illusionist\u00a0<br/>\n09: Illusionist: Expertise<br/>\n10: Illusionist: Empower Spell<br/>\n11: Illusionist\u00a0<br/>\n12: Illusionist: Improved Expertise<br/>\n13: Illusionist\u00a0<br/>\n14: Illusionist\u00a0<br/>\n15: Illusionist: Maximize Spell<br/>\n16: Illusionist\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSkills would be concentration, heal, tumble, spellcraft and discipline<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main plan would be buff up myself and any teammates or a summon and go in with a greatsword. I'm not sure I need expertise with DR and concealment, but I'll have pretty low AC in robes otherwise and if I get focused on I imagine stoneskins etc dropping pretty fast.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you guys think?</div>"
