When we post builds here, and when we give advice, we aim at being able to handle rather tough environments.<br/>\n<br/>\nSocial skills are a bit different from other skills in the respect that they have no standard target values. Module designers decide what DC they give the skill checks, and some even have different ways of checking the skills other than the regular d20 roll. So what is good enough, really depends on where you play.<br/>\nYou can play and test, or you can open the module in the toolset and study closer the different options that appear in dialogues if you want to be sure.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Any build with 14 INT &amp; lots of Rogue levels will have an abundance of skill points. You could experiment with that but there are very few modules where the social skills will have a significant impact on the gameplay because of their single-player nature. Usually, modules have a static DC for their targets such as the diplomacy check at the end of HotU. Some modules might require a significant investment in certain skills &amp; their targets can be fairly high such as Spot &amp; Search in Sands of Fate series. Additionally, there is one module that I know of that uses social skills &amp; their targets grow with your level, that is Swordflight. I don't remember what happens in Aielund Saga, perhaps Mick or Stag are better to answer this.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I know you certainly can make use of social skills in Aielund in assorted amounts and in various occasions throughout the campaign. They can alter the way certain (sometimes significant) conflicts may be resolved without bloodshed - though not the final results. You won't lose xp either, though some of the treasure rewards and loot will obviously be different (but still scaled with level).<br/>\n<br/>\n<em class=\"mention\">@Empyre65</em>\u00a0 certainly ran his Persuasive Archer (a half-elf Rogue/ Bard/ AA - though I might be wrong about Bard) through the campaign successfully. He's not published it in the Level 40 forum, but it can certainly be found in the Aielund and another one or two other threads as well, adapted for different environments.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Taking a build from level 1 up to level 36/7 in a 'real' environment beats a trainer mod, I reckon and it's also been a build asked about in other threads, so it's not too niche. If you're not sure, you can always put Aielund in the build title to make it clear.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd thanks for copying it here - which apart from anything else corrects my erroneous remembrance.
