      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Since I've been helping test out this server for a friend from across the pond, I figured a brief intro wouldn't hurt, so here goes...<br/>\n<br/>\n LoD requires only vanilla resources (NWN/SoU/HotU) to play it. This is a resurrected iteration of a PW from many years ago, one focused primarily on party combat but with a few puzzles that may test the most fastidious of us. It is somewhat linear, though, when I compare it to many \"open\" venues (like WoG, Thain, HG, 3T and their ilk) with unbridled adventuring.\u00a0 Your toon won't be able to access some areas without finishing the goals in the previous sections.\u00a0 That's not always the case, but at least for the primary questline it does apply.<br/>\n<br/>\n Being a combat-intensive environment it can be a great testing ground for ECB builds.\u00a0 Yes, Level 40 is reachable, but there is a downside to high-level... there are areas of scripted damage based on character level, so the higher the level, the more damage proportionately is received... so 200-300 HP damage per round (often negative or divine damage) is not uncommon for a high-level toon to encounter when venturing through those areas without even encountering a hostile.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n This server is designed for party play but can be soloed once the features and mechanics have been thoroughly investigated and perfected.\u00a0 Expect to die A LOT (a server name with \"Deathlands\" in it should infer that much).\u00a0 Familiarity with the environment will mimimize this quite a bit but any level toon can roll a 1 at any time, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n It is an unusual magic environment, though, difficult to categorize as mid-magic or high-magic though it has elements of both.\u00a0 I'll give a few examples to illustrate: <ul><li>Offensive and defensive enhancements are capped at +5.\u00a0 This would infer a mid-magic environment, right?\u00a0 But read on...</li> <li>Lots of resistances and immunities available on items.\u00a0 Most of these items are available in shops or as quest rewards and are quite powerful.\u00a0 Among the enhancements are immunity to: critical hits, sneak attacks, all spells of level X and below, certain spell schools, KD, disease, poison... well, you get the idea.\u00a0 The gear is more like what you might find in a high-magic atmosphere. No ridiculous OnHit weapon properties, fortunately.</li> <li>Access to magical stones that can buff elemental damage on weapons and all abilities up to the cap.\u00a0 The effects will last until the toon: 1) rests, 2) is dispelled, 3) dies or 4) server reset.\u00a0 Some stones are cheap enough for beginning characters to afford while others can be extremely expensive.\u00a0 This has a direct impact on how you play the server and your class choices.</li> <li>Summonable companions.\u00a0 There are three categories:\u00a0 those that can be summoned an infinite number of times per day, those that can only be created using a recipe of components (with several \"sets\" of components and enough gold, fresh versions can be created during the same day) and those that are limited to once per rest period.\u00a0 The weakest of these summons is stronger than most summons (including the undead ones) and the strongest are incredibly tough tanks.</li> </ul>\nPreferred class(es)<br/>\n<br/>\n Any class, vanilla standard or prestige is allowed.\u00a0 Spellcasting classes are challenged the most severely with enhanced creature skins and HDs.\u00a0 Any class that relies on \"uses per day\" like bards or users of divine might/shield (for example) are locked into resting which is somewhat restrictive when item-buffed damage is figured in.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm finding that tankish melee &amp; ranged attacker to be the dominate classes with the highest priority to BAB/AB to be able hit the most challenging bosses who will most certainly be hitting you often and hard, with some nasty special abilities thrown in to round out the challenge even further.\u00a0 AC is important, as well, so Dexers do quite well, though bosses tend to possess extremely high attack ratings and special abilities that will negate all but the most elevated AC levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther features<br/>\n<br/>\n There is a teleport mechanism (cannot be used while engaged in combat since initiated by convo).\u00a0 I really like this gizmo.\u00a0 The part of any environment I like least is forced-traversing areas just to accomplish a single task unrelated to that task except for being a vast tileset that must be mouse-clicked through to gain access to the targeted area.\u00a0 Some of my favorite servers are so intent to maintain some sort of self-proclaimed realism that they forget that the players have real lives that may not permit extended periods for gaming involved around tedium.\u00a0 The LoD server is not one of those ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n Perma-haste property available.\u00a0 Haste effect can be found on many different kinds of gear.\u00a0 It is generally accepted that the Haste property will accompany any toon (eventually) and creatures have been scaled accordingly with increased movespeed, higher AB, high-DC slow spells, web, etc.\u00a0 Combined with the teleport system, makes it painless to revisit areas where key events may have been accidentally missed.<br/>\n<br/>\n Scaled monster spawns.\u00a0 It is not uncommon for say, a Level 20 toon to revisit an area where 1 or 2 dragons spawned when it was Level 10 to find 6 or 8 dropping out of the sky directly above them.\u00a0 Spawns are determined by the level of the highest member of the party, not an average.\u00a0 There are an impressive number of spawned creatures in LoD!<br/>\n - - - - - - -<br/>\n Okay, that's a glimpse without revealing too much... I hope.\u00a0 I've been trying out different build combos, trying to avoid death as much as I can.\u00a0 My party play has been much more fun than soling, though.\u00a0 The group I play with set up an audio server for in-game chat which I love.\u00a0 My typing leaves much to be desired in-game so I appreciate the voice chat shortcut.<br/>\n<br/>\n If you decide to try it out:<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Server name:</strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 BeerfishTV NWN Server\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>Server Location</strong>:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Netherlands<br/>\n<strong>Module name:</strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 deathlands7<br/>\n<strong>Current connection:\u00a0</strong><strong>\u00a0 [89.98.160.77:5121]\u00a0 </strong><em>Note: currently unavailable due to technical problems.\u00a0 No estimate on restoration of service has been furnished.

As you may recall, I'm currently looking for a PW for my first venture into online gaming, and I'm torn between this one, Sword Coast Adventures and the seemingly ubiquitous WoG. I know this is asking for a lot, but which would you recommend for a relative newbie to the game with the sort of playing preferences I've littered about the Guild (non-casting melee-er - though I'm still trying to grasp Cleric - with a Monkish penchant)?<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

A shame about Legend of Deathlands, but I'm sure you'll let us know as and when it's up and running again.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'll be sure to check out the WoG forum and see what's going on there.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for Sword Coast Adventures, all I've read is on another thread in this Persistent World forum (entitled, imaginatively enough, Sword Coast Adventures). Yelpir and Dante seem to rate it highly, and there's a link to the site in the thread.<br/>\n<br/>\n You make a fair point about servers.
