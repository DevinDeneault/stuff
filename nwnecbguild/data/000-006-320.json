I almost feel like it's more their build then mine.

With his ranged damage, skill set and casting abilities he will be a great addition to any group. This is at the same time also his \"weakness\" because he will need a group to come into full effect. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a pure WoG server build, so Mummy Dust is improved (and some other minor changes)! <br/>\n<br/>\nCleric(26), Rogue(4), Champion of Torm(10), Human<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 10<br/>\nDEX: 14<br/>\nCON: 14<br/>\nWIS: 16 (36)<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Rogue(1): Rapid Shot, Point Blank Shot<br/>\n02: Cleric(1): Domain War, Domain Trickery<br/>\n03: Cleric(2): Extend Spell<br/>\n04: Cleric(3): WIS+1, (WIS=17)<br/>\n05: Cleric(4)<br/>\n06: Cleric(5): Zen Archery<br/>\n07: Cleric(6)<br/>\n08: Cleric(7): WIS+1, (WIS=18)<br/>\n09: Cleric(8): Called Shot<br/>\n10: Cleric(9)<br/>\n11: Cleric(10)<br/>\n12: Cleric(11): WIS+1, Weapon Focus: Rapier, (WIS=19)<br/>\n13: Champion of Torm(1)<br/>\n14: Champion of Torm(2): Weapon Focus: Longbow<br/>\n15: Cleric(12): Empower Spell<br/>\n16: Cleric(13): WIS+1, (WIS=20)<br/>\n17: Cleric(14)<br/>\n18: Rogue(2): Improved Critical: Longbow, {Evasion}<br/>\n19: Cleric(15)<br/>\n20: Cleric(16): WIS+1, (WIS=21)<br/>\n21: Cleric(17): Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow<br/>\n22: Champion of Torm(3): {Smite Evil}<br/>\n23: Champion of Torm(4): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=22)<br/>\n24: Cleric(18): WIS+1, Great Wisdom II, (WIS=24)<br/>\n25: Cleric(19)<br/>\n26: Cleric(20)<br/>\n27: Cleric(21): Epic Spell: Mummy Dust<br/>\n28: Rogue(3): WIS+1, {Uncanny Dodge I}, (WIS=25)<br/>\n29: Cleric(22)<br/>\n30: Cleric(23): Epic Spell: Greater Ruin, Great Wisdom III, (WIS=26)<br/>\n31: Cleric(24)<br/>\n32: Champion of Torm(5): WIS+1, (WIS=27)<br/>\n33: Champion of Torm(6): Great Wisdom IV, Great Wisdom V, (WIS=29)<br/>\n34: Champion of Torm(7)<br/>\n35: Champion of Torm(8): Great Wisdom VI, (WIS=30)<br/>\n36: Champion of Torm(9): WIS+1, Great Wisdom VII, (WIS=32)<br/>\n37: Cleric(25)<br/>\n38: Champion of Torm(10): Great Wisdom VIII, (WIS=33)<br/>\n39: Rogue(4): Great Wisdom IX, (WIS=34)<br/>\n40: Cleric(26): WIS+1, Great Wisdom X, (WIS=36)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 412<br/>\nSkillpoints: 257<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 30/38/28<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8<br/>\nBAB: 25<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 26 (melee), 41 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 20/30<br/>\nSpell Casting: Cleric(9)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nConcentration 43(45), Disable Trap 19(23), Heal 17(30), Lore 8(10), Open Lock 23(25), Search 18(20), Set Trap 11(15), Spellcraft 42(44), Tumble 40(42), UMD 36(35)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Disable Trap(4), Open Lock(4), Search(4), Set Trap(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(20), <br/>\n02: Concentration(5), Spellcraft(5), Save(15), <br/>\n03: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(18), <br/>\n04: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(21), <br/>\n05: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(24), <br/>\n06: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(27), <br/>\n07: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(30), <br/>\n08: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(33), <br/>\n09: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(36), <br/>\n10: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(39), <br/>\n11: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(42), <br/>\n12: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(45), <br/>\n13: Save(50), <br/>\n14: Save(55), <br/>\n15: Concentration(3), Spellcraft(3), Save(54), <br/>\n16: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(57), <br/>\n17: Spellcraft(1), Save(61), <br/>\n18: Disable Trap(10), Open Lock(10), Search(14), Tumble(11), UMD(16), Save(11), <br/>\n19: Concentration(3), Spellcraft(2), Save(11), <br/>\n20: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(14), <br/>\n21: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(17), <br/>\n22: Save(22), <br/>\n23: Save(27), <br/>\n24: Concentration(3), Spellcraft(3), Save(26), <br/>\n25: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(29), <br/>\n26: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(32), <br/>\n27: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(35), <br/>\n28: Disable Trap(5), Heal(4), Open Lock(9), Set Trap(7), Tumble(10), UMD(11), <br/>\n29: Concentration(2), Heal(1), Spellcraft(2), <br/>\n30: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(2), <br/>\n31: Concentration(1), Lore(2), Spellcraft(1), Save(3), <br/>\n32: Heal(4), Lore(1), Save(3), <br/>\n33: Lore(5), Save(3), <br/>\n34: Save(8), <br/>\n35: Heal(1), Save(12), <br/>\n36: Save(17), <br/>\n37: Concentration(6), Heal(5), Spellcraft(5), Save(6), <br/>\n38: Heal(1), Save(10), <br/>\n39: Tumble(15), UMD(5), Save(1), <br/>\n40: Concentration(3), Spellcraft(3), <br/>\n<br/>\nAdditional options <br/>\nThere is the option to take 18 WIS and drop STR to 8 and CON to 10. This would leave you with another lvl 2 and 6 spell, another AB etc. However i went for the 16 WIS version because i like having allot more hitpoints and a bit more strenght to carry stuff around with. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso i dropped epic prowess for epic: mummy dust (remember that the WoG server has boosted it's stats).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Suggestions are more then welcome.\n</div></blockquote>\nWoG frequenters would be better to answer the fine points but I can at least venture an opinion to consider.<br/>\n<br/>\nCalled Shot for ANY range attack - Crucial. The only other way to prevent getting mobbed is by casting high-level summon tanks and hope they last long enough (or party with a tank).<br/>\n<br/>\nListen at less than max I find very pedestrian and not worth the investment if you have other more pressing skill needs.  Also, unless you plan to melee, maxed Discipline is about worthless except against archers shooting called shots at your arms.  Opposed Leg shots should mean nothing to a zen archer.  I would sooner cross-class to Set Traps/Disable Traps.  A ranged attacker makes the ideal trap baiter   Enemies are FORCED to close to avoid getting pummeled.  Not so with a melee trapper.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I would gladly yield 2 of the Grt Wis feats in order to \"buy\" others (even pre-epic ones!) if they are more useful.  Your DCs should be fine with WIS@32.  You can buff with Owl's &amp; Bull's to elevate the mighty damage/AB a bit more (see comment about max vs empower).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the Spell Pen feats, I don't think you need them.  I have many caster builds in the 24 to 26 level range that take epic Spell pen and that reaches the same level at yours does without the feats and have no trouble beating most SRs.  At 32 (pen = 33-52, avg 43)<br/>\nit would beat most SRs.  But then again, WoG may have unusually high SRs on their hostiles.  Some servers do. <br/>\n<br/>\nI prefer empower over maximize primarily due to slot management.  It just seems easier to me even disregarding the higher potential of empower.  I would consider it an essential buffing feat.  Again, though WoG may have customized which spells can be empowered or maximized.  I wouldn't know about those things.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlind Fight has limited use with dedicated range attack since it will only provide a re-roll which IMO is not all that critical.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne other issue... Armor Skin for dedicated archer.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf pressed for feats I never use it.  AC should not be much of an issue with an archer if you play it right.  It should never get hit by anything but missiles, either physical ones or magical ones so even though archers are usually dexers, that exhalted DEX AC is seldom used.  Even in close quarters a meatshield can be cast between you and the hostile if you plan ahead.  And for that matter, Tumble has limited use.  Others may play their archers differently.  I built a finesser archer once and probably used the swap like 3 times the entire time.  With Called Leg Shots you should be able to kite away easily enough to avoid all hand-to-hand distance where AC becomes a factor. (also comment about traps applies here)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then you stated that it was intended as ranged support so you SHOULD take absolutely no hits and become a mage killer to allow your party to concentrate on DevCritters &amp; high AB hitters.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it feasible to swap the last 2 levels to get Spellcraft to 43(45)?  It would add +1 to spell saves at least.  I'm not not sure if the total <br/>\nfeat count would change doing it that way, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nKail loves craft wand so I am betting it is very handy on WoG.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a few thoughts to enervate the grey matter a bit on a cool morning.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks for the long post, i really appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI swapped around the last 2 levels because i had no idea i would get a +1 to spell saves when maxing concentration. So that is a nice bonus already.<br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore i would be willing to swap 2 greater wisdom feats for other more useful feats. I just have no idea what feats i should pick. Maximize spell, blind fight are still feats that come to mind but are pre-epic ones. Or even something like lightning reflexes or toughness.<br/>\n<br/>\nSkillwise i have no idea what other skills i would/should pick over the current ones. I don't really like the idea of traps.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso if anyone got some input on getting Rogue instead of CoT that would be nice. <br/>\nUMD / Evasion / UD / Skills (listen / tumble both 42)<br/>\nSaves 24-31-18 (Rogue 3, Cleric 1) vs 26-34-20 (CoT 4).<br/>\nLoosing 2 feats and 20% xp penalty. This could be avoided by taking rogue last few levels, not sure if i should do that. If rogue should be taken earlier then i would consider picking up for 4 rogue (instead of another level in cleric).

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hey mate. I have to tell you that I think your builds are quite tweakable. In fact, I would change many many things on both. so one thing at a time:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- The fighter / CoT build:<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, the first things that jumps to my eyes here is your stats. You don't really need 12 STR and there is ABSOLUTELY NO REASON for you to leave it. You're going to be a Zen Archer and have Divine Power, so those 4 points are better spent elsewhere. Perhaps going STR 8 and increasing your starting Wisdom. The Cleric / CoT combo can easily achieve the 38 Wisdom max possible score (18 starting, +10 stat points +10 Great Wisdom feats). I see no reason for you not to go that way. Drop either CON or DEX as low as you have to (being an archer you shouldn't need much CON anyhow) and pump your starting wisdom to 18 for better AB and spell DC.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond of all, Cleric 32 can be ok, I guess for spell penetration, but I would rather you went Cleric 26 Fighter 4 CoT 10 for more feats, especially epic ones for max Great Wisdom acquisition. This way you can become a great caster and have an insanely high AB with a bow to deal with pretty much anything. Your implosion DC will be just spectacular the higher your WIS is. If you cap WIS, it'll be 50 WIS, which is +20 modifier. With Spell Focus, Greater Spell Focus and Epic Spell Focus on evocation, OMG. And implosion isn't affected by death immunities, so if they don't make the save, they go away. Imagine that REALLY TOUGH mage boss. You approach him invisible, fire one implosion and BOOM, he goes down. Almost feels like cheating! Spell Penetration can be a pain with the lower caster levels, and you don't really have the means to lower monster spell resistance like arcane casters (Mordenkainen's Disjunction and Spell Breach line of spells) and Druids (Nature's Balance) do. But I don't know if you know this, your DCs don't rely on caster level, they only rely on your casting ability modifier, which means, the higher your WIS is, the higher your DCs are. Spell Resistance does, however, and it works like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nd20 + caster level + spell penetration  vs. SR<br/>\n<br/>\nMost people here im ECB know that the MAXIMUM TOOLSET SR (meaning the maximum spell resistance value that can be assigned to a monster in the NWN aurora toolset) is 32. With 26 caster levels, you would have to roll a 6 or more to penetrate the enemy spell resistance if it is at its maximum. But not all monsters have Spell Resistance, and among the ones that do, not all have the maximum possible value. 25% chance that your spells will be resisted by MAX SR monsters is pretty good. Besides, you can always buff up and revert to sniping if the spells are not working.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy dropping 6 levels of cleric, you lose 6 not much needed caster levels and 2 epic feats. Period. By adding 6 CoT levels you gain +3 to all saves and 3 Epic Bonus Feat, plus Divine Wrath, which has been changed on WoG to last longer. You are still effectively undispellable by anything but Mord's.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow let's go to the more drastic approach. Fighter here adds a couple of good feats, WS and EWS, which is quite nice, but you don't get UMD, so I'm more inclined towards your Rogue version as a better alternative for the build. This would grant you access to Mordenkainen and Spell breach scrolls, which would ensure your spells would penetrate even max toolset SR, granted you'd be willing to follow my previous advice and switch up the spread. I'd take Fighter 1 at level 2 for earlier weapon focus, as I see no good reason not to do so. I'd take Called shot MUCH EARLIER, at lvl 3, since WF Longsword is useless except as a requirement to CoT, so why take it so early in the build if your intention is to snipe? Switch up the WF:Longsword to lvl 18 and have called shot for 15 more levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd consider dropping Craft Wand and Scribe Scroll for Spell focus and Greater Spell focus and Armor Skin for Epic Spell focus in Evocation for max implosion DC. Wands are VERY GOOD AND HANDY, but IMO for clerics, you don't really have awesome low level offensive spells that you desperately need more copies of, except for Hammer of the Gods. So I'd just rather memorize the buffs and have a +6 on Implosion DC. As Hip mentioned, you shouldn't need AC in this build, as you can slow things down and especially in WoG where you can darkfire arrows. Even more so if you are in a party, just staying back and firing punishment at mobs while your teammates are your meatshields.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't wanna have to try to sketch what this build would look like if you took my suggestions, I am not sure you'd have enough feats to do so, but I think so. Let me make a list of priorities so you can put your brain to work:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- Get EWF Longbow and all the Spell Focus feats<br/>\n2- Try to take Great Wisdom X for 38 ending WIS<br/>\n3- Get Epic Prowess<br/>\n<br/>\nI say this because you can end up with WIS 37, so by dropping Epic Prowess, you regain the AB through another Great Wisdom, which will also give you more spells per day and +1 to spell DCs.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

CoT gets Great Wisdom as a bonus feat, so if anything, you should go Cleric CoT Rogue, which would allow you to spread your rogue levels through the build without having to worry about XP penalty, making it more playable.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I look at it, it's more or less the same advices as the previous build: get a higher wisdom, get spell focus in evocation and change the spread. Also, if going Rogue, start with rogue to get more skill points. You would lose one AB point that would be recovered with Divine Power.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I'm not sure you can take the War and Trickery domains in WoG, but if you can they are indeed the two best possible domains. If not, I'd give War Domain an edge, as you can get consumables with certain ease to supply your needs. I can show u a way to accumulate 100000000000 invisibility potions in WoG with a build like this, and even a few Dusts of Disappearance, which are sold at the AG.<br/>\n<br/>\nEither build is fine, really, but I did notice you don't pay much attenction to the order in which the feats are taken, which is of paramount importance. I used to do the same thing at the beginning of my building career. That is precisely why I wrote an article on basic building stuff so that you can hopefully catch up with the rest of us in terms of knowledge. Here is the link:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://social.bioware.com/group/2485/discussion/9490/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://social.bioware.com/group/2485/discussion/9490/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nYou may need to join the group first. Take a look at it, I assure you it'll be worth your while, and if you want to see the build I use as reference, let me know and I will e-mail it to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Wow thats a long line of suggestions. Let me hook in on some thoughts about that:<br/>\n<br/>\nFor race / domains i am limited to this:<br/>\nErythnul<br/>\nRequired Domains: War. Trickery.<br/>\nRace(s): Dwarf. Half-Orc. Human. <br/>\nAlignment(s): Chaotic Neutral. Neutral Evil. Chaotic Evil. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow the main issue is: should i take rogue (with xp penalty) or CoT. I cannot make a rogue/cleric/CoT because i would be unable to take a Longbow (or give up another feat and i think that would be too heavy considering i would also loose my fighter feats). Also dropping fighter would loose me 4 dmg on a bow (EWS) per attack. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso my goal is not getting the highest amount of wisdom. I'd rather focus on archery with some spells instead of having the enjoyment of instakilling any monsters with invis + implosion (might be fun for a bit though ).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the link to your guide, i'll read it through, and i agree that i don't think too much about feats (just which i need / want and maybe a bit on early level handiness).<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, having more CoT (10) and less cleric would give me higher saves 28/38/23 instead of 26/35/20. Though less (like 10) hit points, same ranged AB. <br/>\nThe rogue / fighter / cleric build has 1 less AB. Lower saves, xp penalty but some nice rogue tricks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might edit this post a bit later on, just my first thoughts on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit1: 18 wisdom would require me to lower Con+Str+Int all by 2 points, allot of losses there imo.<br/>\nEdit2: should i go for travel/trickery domains and take elf (longbow prof.) however with the human feat i could pickup martial weapons as well.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Will it make the feat less valuable?<br/>\nAnything to improve skill points wise, and what to do with the remaining 28 points, some in heal maybe?<br/>\nAlso i might want to take my second rogue level a bit earlier.<br/>\nLeaving out longbow and going for shortbow would give me 1d6 instead of 1d8 but free up a feat. Another option is a heavy crossbow (1d10), then i could lower my dex / str to 10, get 18 WIS instead for +1 AB and some more spells (only a lvl 2 + 6 spell). However i would loose rapid shot, +2 reflex.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit1: i noticed that if i take CoT a level before epic i get another AB. So probably CoT at 19 and CL at 21.

Though i need verification if this was a smart idea. It does cost me a full attack (rapid shot)!<br/>\nEdit3: anyone that can tell me the bow damage? I think i'll swap back to longbow because of the additional attack (since i already lost EWS from taking out fighter).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">That build IMO is better than the previous one, but there are many things I would change, even though the changes are less drastic than before:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- I would START WITH ROGUE, as I said before, because at level 1 your skill points are multiplied by 4. That way you'd get more skill points;<br/>\n<br/>\n2- You should re-read the guide or read it all, because at some point there I do mention when you should take your rogue / monk / bard levels for skill dumps. You just randomly threw 3 Rogue levels in pre-epic with no reason, leaving the build in epics without tumble dumps(which is when it needs them the most). I would personally take Rogue 1 at 1, Rogue 2 at level 17 or 18, Rogue 3 at level 27 and Rogue 4 anywhere between 37-40. That way you ensure that your AC stays updated, ur UMD is high enough to use stuff a toon of your level will find in his /her adventures or be able to buy. So go Cleric 16 CoT 2 Rogue 2, since you're taking pre-epic feats in epics, you can take Improved Critical with that CoT 2 bonus feat and take Great Wisdom as a general feat on lvl 27 with absolutely nothing to lose.<br/>\n<br/>\n3- Divine Power is THE BEST SPELL in the game. You should have multiple copies of it memorized, both normal and extended. Divine Power will INSTANTLY SET YOUR STRENGTH TO 18! That's why it's a total, complete and utter waste to put ANY points in Strength on a Wisdom-base zen archer. Trust me, start with 8 STR.<br/>\n<br/>\n4- Rearrange your feats for the first few levels: Move Extend spell to lvl 3, Take Zen Archery at 6 and Called Shot at lvl 9. Zen Archery gives +2 AB (+3 at level 8), not counting any Wisdom buffs or items you may get. So Zen really needs to be prioritized over WF. Go back to the longbow, as there are better and easier to find longbows than crossbows in WoG. Ammunition for bows is also much easier to find than for crossbows, saving you a lot of money and trouble of having to restock. Take Rapid Shot at level 12 and ONLY AT 15 take your Weapon Focus. Why?? Because you are a CLERIC. Your specialty is to buff AB by a variety of means available to ya, that +1 AB won't make a difference if delayed. <br/>\n<br/>\n5- WHERE IS EPIC WEAPON FOCUS?? Take Epic Weapon Focus at level 21, will ya?<br/>\n<br/>\n6- Drop Craft Wand to be able to get Epic Prowess. I don't know if you know this, but you can only craft wands of low levels spells IIRC 4th or lower. Yes, you can craft a wand of Flamestrike, which is a lvl 5 spell to a cleric, but only because it's druid lvl 4.<br/>\n<br/>\n7- Before reposting, read ALL the article I wrote, and reevaluate the build MANY TIMES. I don't mean to be rude, but the mistakes you made here are pretty basic, so take your time reevaluating the build. You still have a lot to learn so I also advise that you post your builds in the Build Request forum. Why? Because they're probably going to change drastically from the original idea, which means that they're not ready. Partly because you're not ready either. I know this first hand because when I joined the guild I was excited and I wanted to see what these guys would have to say about my builds, so I went ahead and posted 3 of them. I knew so little of the game back then, much less than you do now, and back in 2006 there were many more active members and elders to discuss the builds. I got such heavy criticism (well deserved BTW) to my builds and I had no idea why these people were \"flaming\" my builds so badly or even what they were talking about. They had done so well in the modules I played. Simple, I was wrong and these people knew infinitely more about this game than I did. But I had no such thing as a guide to the BASICS of character building at my disposal, so I had to learn through trial and error, which is very frustrating. And if you think that this guide is advanced, it's because you have no clue how much more complex it can get. Sorry, I know it does sound arrogant, but trust me, there is much you don't know, and that means that anything you can cough up right now will probably need serious tweaking and somewhat drastic changes to become \"good\". That's why the Build Request is the best place to start. I've been building for 5 years, and I still post the builds I am not quite sure about in that section. In fact, there is one there right now, a Sorcerer Bard RDD Spellsword. Just to clarify, build request sounds like a forum where you go to say: \"I want a build like this this and that for a server with these characteristics, with a lvl cap of X and these restrictions\" and then the people help you come up with something. That can be done there too, but it's also a place where you can post your non-ready builds so that people give you their suggestions and you can reach a final version that satisfies you. So far you've had 3 re-posts and the build has gone from Cleric 32 Fighter 4 CoT 4 to Cleric 26 Cot 10 Rogue 4. And I'm still giving you many tweaks you can make to improve it.<br/>\n<br/>\n8- Kail, I think it's wise we move this topic to the Build Request forum, and then Marshall can repost it here once he gets a final version that he is satisfied with.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>Edit1: i noticed that if i take CoT a level before epic i get another AB. So probably CoT at 19 and CL at 21. This thanks to your guide about AB progression from the link you gave </div></blockquote> <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's much more than a guide to BAB progression, it's a guide on the BASICS of building. You should definitely continue reading it! There is much more you need to know that will help you, if you will, become a junior builder . Then to acheive the status of Elder builder you will have to have deeper knowledge of some 70% of the classes, what they can bring to the table and different ways in which you can use them. That will take you around 4 years. I'm not exaggerating. Maybe 3 years if you abandon RL and decide to devote yourself to NWN Character Building only.  If you don't believe me, look at HipMaestro's white beard! It was brown when he started!!! hehe<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

When you play it, try to use the features it has, like Rapid Shot, Called Shot Leg on meleers so that they can't get to you and Called Shot Arm on archers to reduce their AB so they can't hit you.

Just one little thing I'd like to comment on which is this:<br/>\n<blockquote><div>Edit1: been reading your guide more (and trying not to miss any points) and it seems tumble/umd 40 is the max you should pick so that would free up more skill points.

Probably my last post today because it's pretty much past midnight here so time to get some sleep.</div></blockquote>\n\nTumble works on multiples of 5 BASE RANKS, which means that no matter your DEX modifier, you will get +1 AC every 5 ranks and that's pretty much it.<br/>\n<br/>\nUMD works on multiples of 5 MODIFIED RANKS, which means that your CHARISMA modifier will get counted, so if you can't buff your CHA, which you shouldn't even try to buff (unless you can find an item that gives you Charisma and some other thing that is actually useful to ya), you can consider taking Rogue at 18/28/38 (obviously apart from 1) which will round up your modified ranks at 40 (41 -1 from 8 CHA). However, the problem is that UMD allows you to use items according to their in-game value. I don't know exactly how it works, maybe you can try to understand it. Here is the link:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Use_magic_device\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Use_magic_device</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNow it says there that a UMD of 25 is sufficient to use a Holy Avenger, which is a very powerful item, so perhaps no more than 30, 35 ranks are needed in WoG to be able to use their most powerful items. Perhaps Kail would know this, as he's a more experienced builder than myself and also has been playing on WoG for much longer. Kail, would you grace us with your presence to clarify this little WoG doubt? In a +1 low magic environment, I think even 10 ranks in UMD could suffice. This info is also pertinent to my Sorcerer Bard RDD build, so I eagerly await an answer.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>The only questions left is: what to do with 46 skill points (can i use sneak attack in some way with hide maybe?), and does this build look decent?</div></blockquote>\n\nYou effectively have 49 remaining skill points, as you need only 40 Tumble and 41 UMD (to end up with 40 modified ranks as I explained above). Depending on Kail's reply to my question here, you could even have 5 or 10 more from the \"unusable\" UMD. My first suggestion would be to put these points in either Listen or Spot (pick one and max out). True Seeing in WoG has been modified to add to those skill modifers to detect hidden creatures (rather than automatically detecting them like in default NWN). That means that you need at least one of these skills to be able to see hidden creatures, even with true seeing. I often go with listen, for absolutely no reason, toss a coin and pick one. That will account for 42 skillpoints, leaving 7 others to mess with. You can take Open Lock and Disable Traps, or whatever. Rogues have the best skillset in the game, I'm sure you can come up with something.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does look much better now, much closer to ready. I hope you find it so as well. I would still suggest you changed that CoT sequence you take at levels 29, 30, 31 and 32 and take Cleric there instead. This will lower your AB and grant you less spells per day for a while, but you'll become undispellable much sooner. When you reach Cleric 24, Greater Dispelling will do nothing to you, then you take these CoT levels. IMO it's the best way to go, even more so in WoG, where dispel spammers are everywhere! <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're willing to endure a little PAIN for the first 6 levels, you could start with 12 DEX and 12 CON for 40 more HP. I say this because as a cleric you can wear a full plate for AC, but for the first 6 levels, you will have to endure your AB being modified by DEX till you get Zen Archery (I got one word for ya, mate: SUMMONS!). After that, you will be fine. Also you should DEFINITELY switch Longsword for a Scimitar, because WoG has very few perma-haste items, one of them is the Scimitar of Speed (+1, 1d6 Sonic damage). AFAIK is the only hasted weapon you can get with certain ease in the server (I can show you how when you get to that point). It will save you LOADS OF TIME buffing and increase your melee prowess considerably with one extra attack per round and +4 Dodge AC in those situations where you can't avoid a melee confrontation. Note that this last tweak is purely WoG-oriented, and has nothing to do with the build itself. <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I hope he hasn't left for Germany yet either.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt depends what you intend to do with UMD.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI realize you are skeptical casting from scrolls via UMD but do not let that cloud the issue for others (a stack of Mords, Greater Sanctuary or Time Stop scrolls is nothing to sneeze at unless you are failing the checks in the heat of the battle and wish you had taken more ranks in UMD). It always is a benefit to keep UMD maxed even beyond the 5-level increments until you hit 35 (1d20 + 25 + spell level) for exactly that reason.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know what the top value items are on WoG but I've played high-magic servers where you needed levels 85 to 90 modified ranks of UMD to use the top-end items.  Obviously, that meant equipping items that would boost the UMD skill to achieve those levels.  Don't know if there are skill modifier caps on WoG, but there weren't on those high-magic ones.  Most people don't want to try to decipher the high-end values on a server so just take either 35 or 40 ranks and are done with the decision-making process in their building.  High CHA builds can get away with much fewer ranks, naturally.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

On the contrary, I like it! Thing is that in the particular build we had the discussion, it wasn't that useful. For this toon it's a whole new world. This toon could benefit greatly from having UMD scrolls. GS he can already use as Cleric spells, so no biggie there. But Time Stop here would be awesome (whereas my Holy Weapon Master with Cheese would have not much use for it, maybe to approach or attempt a KD, tops). This toon can cast TS and buff up with DP, DF and Darkfire on a stack of arrows and fire very painful arrows that will most likely prevent any mage from casting anything, or even fire an Implosion spell precisely aimed for maximum effectiveness. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, what I understood from the text in NWN Wiki is that to cast a scroll you'd need to make a check of 1d20 + UMD which needs to surpass a DC of 25 + spell level, not the way you put it there. That would mean 25+9 = 34 is the maximum DC to cast through UMD, so you'd need 34 to ABSOLUTELY CERTAINLY cast a lvl 9 spell. So there ya go, UMD of 35 is the minimum acceptable, unless some WoG items that you may want to equip require a higher score. To emulate an alignment, the DC is 5 points higher, to emulate a race, you add +5 to DC, so on and so forth. If you want to be sure your UMD is as high as it possibly can be, then leave it at 40. I'm not advocating it should be done differently, on the contrary, I completely agree with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, this build does try to max out UMD as much as it possibly can with the very few available Rogue levels it gets. I take into account the places I know you can level up in WoG and how hard they are when I spread these Rogue levels. And WoG is a low to mid magic server, so that's why I was wondering about being able to lower it a bit and still be able to equip the meanest items on the server. But I doubt it would be worth it. I think max UMD is the best choice for this build.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Thanks for the re-interpretation, Max.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon't underestimate a stack of Mords, either.  Many of the best cleric spells must pass an SR check (like Implosion  ) so that stack of Mords is better than taking the 3 penetration feats.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat really makes UMD the most powerful skill is that with a single late dump of any UMD class, EVERY build achieves the same magical godliness.  The only thing limiting its exploitation is how deep your pockets are or how many arcane scribers (or divine ones) are willing to barter with you.  No wonder so many servers try to nerf it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis why I never PvP.  All any battle between UMD scroll readers comes down to is who launches the first Time Stop.   After that, the battle has been won.  The only way to prevent the fatal domino effect with PvM bosses is to artificially elevate the SR and saves vs. spells for hostiles so that spells will usually fail the checks.  Been there, done that.  A little birdie *g* told me WoG doesn't modify their enemy creatures to that extent, so UMD will be godly on that server.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did have a problem using Time Stop in combination with an item with Holy Avenger property though.  It dispels the Time Stop effect.  Whether this interaction was unique to the servers I played on, I can't say, but it would consistently end the time stop effect.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

At the same time, they have a custom script that better simulates caster levels when scribing a scroll, so if you can trade in-game with othe players you are certainly better off. That is great because in NWN default script, a lvl 38 Wizard would craft an improved invisibility scroll, and it would come out with a caster level of 7.

There are so many things to take into account when building that you always end up forgetting something. I forgot about the rapid shot requirement and the UMD scrolls so far. Let's see if I forget something else till we end this discussion. LOL<br/>\n<blockquote><div>Concentration 43(43), Discipline 41(40), Heal 4(18), Listen 24(38), Set Trap 28(30), Spellcraft 43(45), Tumble 38(40), UMD 36(35)</div></blockquote>\n\nDude, Tumble works in BASE RANKS, so you need 40 for +8 to AC. Listen should be MAXED OUT. Otherwise you won't be able to see stealthers. Leave Set traps at 15, which is enough to use common traps, but not enough to use epic ones. Having Listen is more important than setting traps, because Clerics can Darkfire arrows on WoG, so you don't have to worry about doing damage. Maximillian isn't a proficient archer and he can snipe pretty well just because of Divine Power + Divine Favor + Darkfire arrows (Fire arrows as well, which are quite easy to find). And forget Heal, those 4 points are doing absolutely no good to the build. <br/>\n<br/>\nI prefer the first variant of the build, just because you can use spells more effectively to disable mobs. You should have in mind which is possibly the weak save of the mob you are facing and hit it with spells directed to that save. Also the strong save so you avoid wasting spells. Here is a rough list:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Caster types: Clerics, Druids, Mages<br/>\n<br/>\nWill: High<br/>\nReflex: Depends, but mostly low to average<br/>\nFort: Low<br/>\n<br/>\n- Dex types: Rogues, rangers, arcane archers, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nWill: Low<br/>\nReflex: High<br/>\nFort: Low to average<br/>\n<br/>\nException to this rule are monk-heavy types, which get high scores on all saves.<br/>\n<br/>\nMeleers: Fighters, Barbarians, Str-based rangers, WMs, Paladins, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nWill; Low<br/>\nReflex: Low to average<br/>\nFort: High<br/>\n<br/>\nExceptions to this rule are high CHA Paladins, BGs and CoTs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in each situation you can use different spells. Casting stonehold on a bunch of meleers is deadly because they're more likely to fail their saves than a bunch of casters. Casting Hammer of the Gods is equally good against melee, as it involves a will save vs the stun effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou should have this in mind when playing this toon.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it looks quite solid, so other than the little adjustment to the skills, I would say it looks ready. How about you, Hip?<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Limit yourself to reading scrolls that can't be dispelled unless you are among non-magics which is rare.  Using UMD to buff yourself with scrolls is just a waste of time IMO.  Stick to spells that allow no saves, or better, no SR check either (like Time Stop) and the true power of UMD is revealed.  Greater Sanctuary (for pure UMDers, of course) is one of the exceptional buffs because it can't be targeted.  I wouldn't bother with Imp Invis scrolls either because even the 50% conceal can be dispelled (I've tested it, so that is fact).  I use Greater Spell Mantle scrolls (caster level 17) with my UMD clerics and it lasts pretty long.  It can be shredded but while they are shredding they are dying .<br/>\n<br/>\nThat customization on WoG seems pretty kewl.

So one option would be to drop Concentration, maybe even all of it. Having average Concentration is the same as nothing, besides you have UMD, and when casting from scrolls you don't need to make a concentration check, so it's pretty droppable as long as you remember not to cast your cleric spells in melee range of anything / anyone. Then you could go for set traps 23 just in case you want that deadly gas traps and even put a few points in open locks, just to open the basic ones. Also, having 40 UMD when you don't know the items in the server is a safer bet. So, drop concentration, then redistribute your points between Open Locks, UMD, Set Traps and Disable traps and you should be all set.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother alternative is to NOT get disable traps at all and get 15 Set Traps (as you'd lose the synergy bonus). In WoG, many mobs drop traps in their loots quite frequently and there is a merchant which sells them, so recovering traps isn't vital. I think I can take you there when the time is right. Then you can drop 3 Concentration ranks and end up with 40 instead of 43. That way you still can cast in melee and set traps, but you'll need to spend some money on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Let's see how well your ability to detect traps can be right now without allocating any points since Search does not require training:<br/>\n<br/>\nSearch level = 3 (Emp Fox's) + 2 (INT mod) +2 (synergy) + 10 (avg roll rounded down) = 17, which is good enough to detect just about all traps except for electrical &amp; fire ones (and gas, naturally) IF you are a patient venturer and allow the DC checks to occur (each 6 secs.).  (...and I haven't even figured Divine Trickery into the mix, mostly because it can only be used 1x/day, but it is sweet when active! +13 to those skills for at least 4 turns  )<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if you were to shift even 4 points from Disable Traps over, retaining the synergy (5 ranks) for setting them, it would be 21, which would be enough to locate stronger versions of the above mentioned and not need to wait so long to get the good rolls.  I generally find 10 points in Search is plenty especially if there are a few minor boosts from equipment. <br/>\n<br/>\nOpen Locks is another take 20 skill. So with a single point (i.e. training) and a set of +10 lockpicks, you can open DCs of 31.  This is another environment-specific caveat though so Max would know better what the max enhancement for Lock Picks is on WoG and how high the lock DCs are.  For a cleric (unless you need to unlock while in GSanctuary or Imp Invisibility) Flamestrike, the perfect pair of firey lockpicks, will destroy any door or container unless scripted otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a question though that you may have covered somewhere in thread... <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy a single pre-epic focus feat in a melee weapon for a zen archer?  The thing is:  unless you anticipate well in advance that you will be needing extra AC (I am assuming that would be your basic rationale), how are you going to buff up fast enough to get any use out of it at all?  If you just swap during combat you will not be hitting anything, just standing there swinging in the air.  So I view that as a wasted feat in a build that is already somewhat feat-starved to begin with.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally, we get to Discipline.<br/>\n<br/>\nTBH, I never even consider taking even 1 point in Discipline unless it is a strength build.  I have found that unless the modified base is AT LEAST 45 in a level 40 build, you will miss most of the checks against IKD, Disarm &amp; Called Shots.  Yes, AoV &amp; Emp Bull's will help some, but won't raise you into the mid 50's where most of the checks will be won.  The whole Discipline discussion should probably be staged in a separate thread in the discussion forum.  But just be aware that even fully buffed, without high strength you will subject to losing lots of Discipline checks from high AB/high damage meleers which, as a dedicated support archer, you shouldn't be facing anyway.  <br/>\n<br/>\nDon't take Point Blank Shot too literally for a Zen Archer. Although it is a prereq for Rapid Shot it really only works well for shifty high DEX archers with Dodge, Mobility, etc.  While wearing heavy armor, there is little AC to be lost so UD in a build like this has limited value. A non-Monk Zen Archer just can't stand toe-to-toe while getting flanked.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I also agree with Max about the pseudo usefulness of Concentration in an artillery build.  Use those summons if you don't have a tank in your party and stay out of harms way.  The real power of this build is the uncontested constant barrage of high-damage divine arrows.  Once you drop that bow, it becomes a pedestrian cleric with a sword and shield.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, that is  my last two centavos *waits for the applause* on this one since even if not totally tweaked to perfection *lol*, it should perform very well.

The more attacks you have per round, the more times you multiply your damage bonuses from spells in your attack. 15 from Darkfire (approximately), 5 from Divine Favor, and if the bow has Mighty +5, 4 or 5 from Strength with Divine Power. That's 25 damage a round only on extra damage. If you add the attack damage and critical hit possibility, it rocks, just like flurry of blows does for melee cleric / monks. Trust me on that .

Yeah, we had our moments back in the day, mainly because I had so little knowledge of the game back then that I wasn't equipped to understand what you and the other elders were telling me. What to you seemed basic to me was light years ahead and therefore incomprehensible. Now I have written that guide to the basics of building (which I might repost here in the General Discussion forum after a few corrections) to prevent exactly that type of gap from happening to others. The OP ended up going with 36 WIS despite my advice for some added sturdiness, but not much of a difference except -1 AB, -1 to all spell DCs and a few spells a day (1 lvl 2 and 1 lvl 6 IIRC) for 80 HP and +2 Fortitude.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You'll suffer the loss of +1 mighty damage going from Str 10 to Str 8 but gain 40 HP &amp; a fort save (if ported over to CON) which IMO is worth losing 1 damage from a capped mighty bow and the indirect affect on DEX skills with Dex dropped from 14 to 13.  Avado just checked in on the discussion about even-odd tallies, pros &amp; cons, but with 9, 13, 13... it's going a bit overboard.  The DEX is fine because wearing heavy armor you'll only net 1 AC from DEX anyway, and if you ignore DEX altogether on equipment, the combination of AoV &amp; either standard or Emp Cat's would boost DEX skills by at most +5 though you would need to unequip the armor to realize the boost.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the DP spell slots, use the extended version in Level 5 as your mainstay saving the unextended ones for emergencies. I use level 4 slots mainly for empowered buffs myself.  Battletide would be best extended at Level 6, True Seeing and Spell Resistance can be slotted in either 5 or 6 with equal effectiveness.  By virtue of WIS 36 you'll be getting 3 extra slots at 5 &amp; 6 anyways so it should be manageable.  You ARE indispellable for the most part so those extended DPs will last over 5 turns, which isn't chunk change.<br/>\n<br/>\nShortage of DPs is one of the prices you must pay for taking Trickery over Strength.  You may find that depending on trickery boost under game conditions is more trouble than it's worth since it is one of those once-per-day specials (and only 4 turns unless boosting CHA beforehand).  IMO, unless you are planning on being a point blank archer, the value of Imp Invis is diminished for a ranged attacker.  Don't get me wrong on this point, it is awesome to have Imp Invis within melee range but if the foe has Blind Fight its benefit is seriously devalued even further.  If it were my character, I'd depend on my allocated and spell-buffed skills for the roguish talents, take War &amp; Strength and have all the DPs I could ever need.  Let's see if others have a similar view or counter.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If you feel the need to have Quicken Spell with a Zen Archer Cleric is because you're doing something wrong. Sorry mate, but it's true. What I don't understand is your need to keep messing with builds that have already been made, tweaked and deemed as solid good builds by the more experienced members of this guild. In general, EVERY SINGLE TIME you've done this so far, you've only had ideas that would make the build worse. I have already suggested this before, and I will do so again: If you're encountering any difficulties, perhaps you need to re-think something in your playstyle, spellbook management or something like that. It's not always in the build you know? Seriously, I DO NOT UNDERSTAND how you can POSSIBLY consider your damage output not satisfactory if you're playing on WoG, where GMW works on bows and Darkfire works on arrows. I mean, you'd probably commit suicide if you played somewhere else then, try to imagine this build WITHOUT GMW working on bows and Darkfire on arrows and you'll have a good idea of how it's supposed to be in the first place, then you will hopefully come to realize how good it is with the custom modifications. It will never do 130 damage like your Charnel lord does, because it's not supposed to. High STR builds do high damage, archers in general, do not. If you get to lvl 40 in WoG and use your level 40 DM buy to get a bow, then you will do much more damage, but never as high as a STR build.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, you should start by getting used to using Called Shot (Leg on Meleers, Arm on archers), casting Divine Favor EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU FIGHT, leaving Extended Divine Favor for tougher encounters. Divine Power should also be used in all but the easiest combats, and similarly, Extended Divine Power for tougher fights. From a certain point on, you should ALWAYS have enough spells to get you through the day. And if you don't have enough spells to finish a dungeon at some point on your own, then it's because WoG is balanced for PARTY PLAY, not solo, not because your build is gimped. Use Leomund's Secure Shelter scrolls to rest in areas where you weren't supposed to be able to (another WoG custom modification that this build can take andvantage of, as you can use these scrolls with UMD) and try not to get hurt for no reason. The other day when we were playing together you walked over several Blade Barrier spells in several different situations without having evasion where you could've just gone around them. In time, if you do this, you will grow to understand when a build does require modifications and when it's just the fact that you should learn new tricks or get used to its weaknesses, as all builds have them. As a general rule:<br/>\n<br/>\n- STR builds do more damage and have lower ACs<br/>\n- DEX builds do less damage and have higher ACs<br/>\n<br/>\nThis build is a Zen Archer, but in terms of damage it works just like a DEX build, because the stat that boosts AB doesn't boost damage. Please reflect on this before you go ahead and try to change a build that is very good as is.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

What I mean and that you don't seem to be able or willing to understand is that to tweak builds, you need experience, playtime and knowledge, none of which you have. I don't mean it in a bad way, but you have to agree with me that most of the people that posted advice to you on this guild have more of the three above than you do. They gave you advice, suggested many tweaks and reached a conclusion with you, step by step, so that you could have a good strong toon in your hands. I was once like you, and I can talk from experience when I say that to draw conclusions you need to have a certain basis of knowledge. If you furiously keep trying to change things in a build that you haven't had experience with (I mean played exhaustively, or at least often enough that you know its intricacies and combos), but that other people have agreed upon that aside from personal preferences is a solid build, then you aren't heeding the advice given to you. Not that you HAVE TO listen to us, you don't, but as a general rule, if you do, things will be better. Just so you know, Quicken Spell is a waste to pretty much every class, exactly because it's negated by haste. Having a spell cast 4 levels above is a waste in nearly all cases, I can't think of one situation in all my experience where I would've found use for that feat. To try to change, say, Empower Spell, for example, you first need to realize why it's been chosen. I ask, do you?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, you can and should think for yourself, obviously, but whenever you find yourself thinking of changing something in an already tweaked and optimized build like this one, ask yourself: why is it there in the first place? Is it really a matter of personal preference or is there something I'm not seeing?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my opinion anyway. Didn't mean to offend you, like I said, just trying to open your eyes. I won't try to do that again, just so you don't take offence.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Does Max's information make sense and are you learning from it?  If so, then he is being an effective teacher.  Don't take so much offense that you forget to realize that he's taken time out of his day to answer the questions of someone he doesn't even really know (even if he has played with you on WoG).  He might sometimes be grating with that \"We've got more experience and you're a noob so don't question our wisdom\" spiel, but when you get down to brass tacks.. he's basically right.  And as much as he may start off with comments that seem to discourage questions, he nearly always (99% of the time) will still answer those questions thoroughly and mostly respectfully (if maybe tinged with a bit of condescension   ).  Focus on the answers you get, not on how that information is presented. <br/>\n<br/>\nMax:  You're a good dude and I appreciate a ton the amount of information you've provided here.  As I noted above, you can present yourself as a little patronizing, but that doesn't mean your information is bad or unappreciated.  One point of advice is to not worry so much when people question your information or the information of the other experienced builders.  Experience may be one of the best teachers, but thorough explanations are also very good teachers.  If the person you are answering doesn't seem to appreciate your tone or even your answer, remember, this is a community board.  That means there are many more people who are absorbing the knowledge being presented.  So don't get so wrapped up in someone else's more vocalized perception of you that you forget that others benefit from your answers besides the person you are directly answering.  Be yourself and if someone doesn't like it, then tough.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

IDK if it's the lack of \"tone\" in internet communication or the fact that I'm Brazillian and English isn't my first language, or even if it's a cultural thing. The fact is that I don't mean to be patronizing, I'm just trying to stop people from making pretty much many mistakes that I made when I was a noob. Sometimes you need to have a basis of knowledge before you're equipped to question certain advice. You should've seen me back when I was a noob, about 5 years ago. I was pretty close to what foojin is today, except for the fact I asked a lot more questions (but still wasn't equipped to understand the answers). Considering how far I've come since then, one can argue that it's a good thing, but having been there I know that learning this way can be extremely frustrating, because you're basically seeking answers that are already there, but you just can't see them. I remember when I made my Bane Crusher build and I was investing skill points in Spellcraft cross-classed because I wanted better saves, when basically I needed items that could give me Death and Mind spells immunity, like Clarity Potions and Scrolls of Death Ward or a Belt of Guiding Light. I had no idea that, for instance, a Dwarven Defender could use a belt of damage resistance to stack with his already high Damage Reduction for 47/- absorption of a certain type of physical damage. Combine that with a wand of Protection from Elements and the only thing that will damage you is Divine Favor and Critical Hits. All of the above are \"tweaks\" to playstyle, and that's what I was suggesting foojin should do, enhance his in-game prowess, learn new tricks. That's even more true on WoG, where the world is balanced for more experienced players, lest he finds himself in a position where his toon can't get past a certain level without someone else's aid.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am usually a very straightforward man, and I don't mind my words much, I don't usually use euphemisms and such (If someone dies I say: \"He's dead\", not \"He passed away\" or \"He's in a better place\", shit like that) so that might be why I come off as patronizing, but regardless of the words I use, I do deliver the exact message I want. What I ask is that you don't infer the wrong tone to it, otherwise I may come off as rude, which isn't my intention.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout not worrying if people question my information and other people's, well, I kind of can't help it in a way. The other day I was playing with foojin and I told him that he needed to do the exact same thing I say he needs to do here, which is improve his playstyle. I wasn't trying to be rude or annoy him, I was trying to help him become a better player. He said to me and I quote: \"I think my playstyle is fine\". What would you do? Just stop helping altogether? Cuz that's the only two choices I see, do this or just stop trying to help (which kind of sucks cuz I see a lot of myself in him and I really think I could help him if he'd just listen to me)....<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this isn't going anywhere and I should probably stop before I inadvertedly offend him again.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
