I figured all these yardstick builds would be posted as finished, tested builds in the Level 40 section, but any place is better than no place so here goes (posted in 4 submissions mainly to help maintain my own sanity)...<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>The Rogue, Unmasked</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nHow are the rogue's talents expressed as a stand-alone entity and as an extension of an adventuring party?<br/>\n<br/>\nDesigning and playing an effective rogue is all about continual movement.  Slow &amp; silent, evasive &amp; luring, but always sliding just out of reach.  They taunt by action rather than words until the opposition can no longer resist the impulse to pursue,  recklessly at times.  By nature, it is an agile class... a scout who provides the initial reconnaissance for the party, eliminating potential threats and setting the stage for action.  But being the first into unfamiliar territories brings its own unique form of danger.   The rogue spends a significant amount of time isolated from the rest of the party, though support may not be far off and at the ready.   Whether acting as a solo adventurer or in concert with others, a scamp's survival relies on a common formula...  anticipate-set defenses-execute.  Sometimes, magical means are the only way to manage a situation and in that respect, as a fighting magician, a rogue comes well-equipped.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, let's examine the essence of the rogue as a pure class:<br/>\n<br/>\nStrengths<br/>\n- Highly-skilled.  Able to specialize in more areas than any other class and at higher skill levels.<br/>\n- Sneak attacks.  Inflicts high damage and debilitating effects during melee or from a distance; will overcome damage reduction barriers in most creatures that are susceptible to surprise tactics.<br/>\n- Trap mastery.  Levels the playing field with trap threats that are virtually impossible for enemies to detect and even harder to avoid. <br/>\n- Slippery.  Able to bypass many attacks that would otherwise effect most other disciplines. <br/>\n- Recon specialist.  Reliable stealth while scouting unknown areas to eliminate potential threats and barriers.<br/>\n- The perfect base class support archer.  Ranged sneaks make the rogue class especially dangerous with allied support.  <br/>\n- Related^; if managed properly, DEX AC will not be lost while in range attack with the possible exception of AoOs by mobs of dispersed archer foes.<br/>\n- With stealth and trap controls, one of the most \"haste-independent\" classes.<br/>\n- Mimicry.  With adequate training in UMD, arcane and divine magic become part of the rogue's repertoire.  Bypasses the restrictions of custom equipment that is normally reserved for use by other classes by sheer resourcefulness.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeaknesses<br/>\n- Limited to 3 attacks per round without DW or Rapid Shot<br/>\n- Undisciplined.  Especially susceptible to being knocked prone, disarmed and subject to reduced combat effectiveness by shots to the legs and arms.<br/>\n- Related^; finessed weapons will do meager damage when sneaks are not being applied (undead, dragons, etc.) ... what I (and perhaps others out there) refer to as the \"DEXpecker\" effect, resulting in battles that seem to take forever.  Even with the advantages of Epic Dodge and Self-Concealment, providing an enemy with extended periods of opportunities for counterattack can become disastrous.  When flanked, the benefits of high DEX AC is negated and subject to more successful attacks.<br/>\n- Poor Fortitude and Will saves.  A characteristic especially noticeable against mages and clerics who employ spells that capitalize on this weakness.<br/>\n- Low HPs, especially for melee.  With a limited ability to absorb continual high damage, it forces a melee sneaker to use hit-and-run tactics which can expose them to additional AoOs.  Not as much of of an issue for attacks from 30 ft. distance.<br/>\n- No innate means of countering damage reduction of crit/SA-immunes (ala Arcane Archer).<br/>\n- Lack of focus (concentration). Can be easily taunted within melee range.  <br/>\n- The vanilla Find Traps spell completely negates the potential of all traps, even epic ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to the builds themselves...  <strong>Shadow Trapmaster, Shadow Crippler &amp; Shadow Devastator</strong><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\"><strong>\"From out of the mist, the sound of plucked strings and a hail of darts.  Then the furor of rushing feet, the lash of flames and stinging steel, the screams of agony and despair.  Then, only stillness and silence remains as the vapor vanishes.\"</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nIMO, there are just too many advantages of a rogue's ranged sneak attack to even consider meleeing with any non-cleric DEX build.  The integration of traps and long-range SA combined with the rogue's ability to avoid attacks can result in a very secure and powerful combat style.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHigh-speed aggressors (like speed monks) are especially susceptible to massive trap damage and incapacitation since the traps are set with a DC too high to detect, triggering more traps per round than a slower, warier closer (against a pure monk, Holy &amp; EPIC traps will be most effective). During actual practice, the dynamic is just the opposite as how one may expect.  The puny ranged shots (those over over 30 ft.) will soften up the closers while steering their advance as the traps provide the death blow and set-up for SA pommeling... rather than the reverse.  Shots to the legs are a reliable means to control the attack surge, allowing the trap field to deal out its potential in the most efficient manner.   Traps can become expensive in some environments so a well-planned, organized field is essential to remaining cost-effective where resources are limited.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Shadow Trapmaster</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://i1132.photobucket.com/albums/m573/HipMaestro/cagematch.jpg\" /><br/>\n<br/>\n(See <span style=\"color:#008000\">Note 3 </span>for detailed description of encounter.)<br/>\n<br/>\nPROS<br/>\n- Complete management (detect/recover/set) of all epic traps and even under duress with Skill Mastery<br/>\n- DCs so high that only a Search-focused build or another rogue (re: epic traps) will be able to detect them<br/>\n- 4 APR with Rapid Shot selected (5 APR hasted w/RS)<br/>\n- 20d6 sneaks<br/>\n- 50% indispellable concealment even against physical ranged attacks (25% vs. Blind Fight owners)<br/>\n- An archer with Epic Dodge and Self-concealment will avoid ranged attacks even within PBS range<br/>\n- Will avoid damage from spells with 1/2 reflex saves like fireball, firestorm &amp; chain lightning<br/>\n- The range attack will avoid the bane of undisciplined attack, namely KD &amp; disarm.  Called Shots can still hurt, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nCONS<br/>\n- Relatively low HP, a major problem vs. IGMS, other high-damage, non-reflex save spells and, in general, any high damage attack (e.g. scythe crits)<br/>\n- Dependant on scrolls and wands for magical defenses without caster allies<br/>\n- Intrinsic low base damage (i.e. DEX-focus) relies on weapon enhancements to penetrate, and traps to kill many creature categories such as:  Balors (DR), Beholders (SA immunity), Devourers (DR), Constructs (DR, crit immunity), <br/>\nDragons (DR, SA immunity), Elementals (DR, crit immunity), Bebeliths &amp; Formians (SA immunity), Oozes (Crit immunity),<br/>\nOutsiders (DR), Reptilians (SA immunity), Shapechangers (DR) and Undead (DR, crit immunity)... *did I miss any?*<br/>\n...not to mention the problems making a dent in PCs who may be using Epic Warding, temporary SA-immune polymorph shapes (including the druid elemental shapes &amp; epic dragon) and barbarian DR in pure-class PvP contests.<br/>\n- Build effectiveness limited to low- and mid-magic environments, due in part to increased number of crit/SA-immune skins and True Seers typically designed into high-magic worlds (at least, this has been my observations of the balancing attempts used in those environments).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn most cases, traps will compensate for the inherent weaknesses of a low-damage DEX attack.  This is not a characteristic specifically of the rogue class, but the rogue's innate ability to manage EPIC traps provides the most powerful application of this skill among all classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe build: <br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSpoiler<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t[+]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tRogue(40), Halfling*, Any Alignment (Any Neutral recommended vs. smiters), PvE<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 8**<br/>\nDEX: 20 (34)<br/>\nCON: 12**<br/>\nWIS: 10**<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Rog01 - Blind Fight<br/>\n02: Rog02 <br/>\n03: Rog03 - Called Shot<br/>\n04: Rog04 - DEX+1 (21)<br/>\n05: Rog05<br/>\n06: Rog06 - WF: Shortbow<br/>\n07: Rog07<br/>\n08: Rog08 - DEX+1 (22)<br/>\n09: Rog09 - Point Blank Shot<br/>\n10: Rog10 - Defensive Roll<br/>\n11: Rog11<br/>\n12: Rog12 - DEX+1 (23), Rapid Shot<br/>\n13: Rog13 - Imp Evasion<br/>\n14: Rog14<br/>\n15: Rog15 - Imp Crit: Shortbow<br/>\n16: Rog16 - DEX+1 (24), Opportunist*** (or Crippling strike)<br/>\n17: Rog17<br/>\n18: Rog18 - Toughness*** (or Weapon Finesse)<br/>\n19: Rog19 - Skill Mastery*** (or Crippling Strike)<br/>\n20: Rog20 - DEX+1 (25)<br/>\n21: Rog21 - Grt DEX I (26)<br/>\n22: Rog22<br/>\n23: Rog23<br/>\n24: Rog24 - DEX+1 (27), Grt DEX II (28), ESkF: Disable Trap <br/>\n25: Rog25<br/>\n26: Rog26<br/>\n27: Rog27 - Grt DEX III (29)<br/>\n28: Rog28 - DEX+1 (30), Epic Dodge <br/>\n29: Rog29<br/>\n30: Rog30 - EWF: Shortbow<br/>\n31: Rog31<br/>\n32: Rog32 - DEX+1 (31), SC I (10%) <br/>\n33: Rog33 - SC II (20%)<br/>\n34: Rog34<br/>\n35: Rog35<br/>\n36: Rog36 - DEX+1 (32), Grt DEX IV (33), SC III (30%) <br/>\n37: Rog37<br/>\n38: Rog38<br/>\n39: Rog39 - SC IV (40%)<br/>\n40: Rog40 - DEX+1 (34), SC V (50%)<br/>\n<br/>\n* See Analysis, Race<br/>\n** See Analysis, Abilities<br/>\n*** See Analysis, Feat Variant<br/>\n<br/>\nHP: 320<br/>\nSaves (F/W/R): 18/17/35 (22/21/39 vs. spells)<br/>\nOther save boni: Fear: +2, Traps: +5<br/>\nBAB: 25<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 25 (melee), 41 (ranged) <br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only):  31/31<br/>\n<br/>\nSKILLS (430)<br/>\n<br/>\nDisable Trap 34(48), Hide 43(59), Listen 43(49), Move Silently 43(61), Open Lock 21(33), <br/>\nSearch 43(45), Set Trap 43(57), Spellcraft 18(20), Spot 43(47), Tumble 40(52), UMD 41(40)<br/>\n<br/>\nNote:  Kamiryn's CBC (using v2.833 here) currently ignores the size modifier for stealth &amp;

The higher base damage of longbow is actually insignificant in a sneak-focused build (elf racial boni vs. -1 AC/-1AB/-1 saves/-4 stealth-detection skills).  However, should Weapon Finesse be preferred, rapier can be used as a 1H weapon (2H with halfling).  Whether 2H or 1H, not really much of an issue, since Shield Prof. is beyond the scope of this design anyway.  Also, the small races suffer size penalties against grapple, KD &amp; disarm.  Your choice.  Either one has its innate advantages.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbilities<br/>\nThe potential benefit of shifting points from from CON (and WIS) to STR can only be realized with Composite (Mighty) bows equipped, but the cost of reducing low save levels (i.e. Will &amp; Fort) and HP total further seems a poor trade-off.  A single potion of Bull's Strength will boost the additional point of base damage for conventional bows.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeats<br/>\nSkill Mastery to set traps while under duress.  Opportunist for better conditional AoOs (+4AB, handy vs. casters).<br/>\n<br/>\nEpic Skill Focus: Disable Trap, required to reach the level to recover epic traps.  Without it, only a level of 47 is possible (48 needed) but with a reliable source of Fox's Cunning available (or INT-boost gear), Epic Skill Focus: Set Trap would be a superior choice, raising the detection and disarm DCs by another +10 vs. other rogue trapper specialists (See <span style=\"color:#008000\">Note 2</span>).<br/>\n<br/>\nSelf-concealment vs. Improved Invisibility.   If you are comfortable with temporary concealment and have access to sufficient Imp Invis casting items, you can eliminate the 5 SC feats, possibly substitute 2 Great DEX for the open general feats and 3 ISA for the open bonus feats.  (---&gt; Be aware that Imp Invis concealment can be dispelled rather easily at the lower caster level of scrolls &amp; item props i.e. Caster level 7.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\">Feat Variant - Finessed Melee </span><br/>\nPurpose: to empower strength-reduction melee sneaks for a DEX-focus design.<br/>\nSubstitute Weapon Finesse for Toughness (-40HP).  Sub Crippling Strike for either Skill Mastery or Opportunist.  <br/>\nSacrifice 1 SC feat to swap +10% concealment for +1AB range/melee (per Epic Prowess).  <br/>\n[See <span style=\"color:#008000\">Note 1</span> for some considerations of implementing a finessed design in this build.]<br/>\n<br/>\nSkills<br/>\nDisable Trap: sufficient to recover epic traps (48 + Take20)<br/>\nHide/Move Silently: wear robes (or go naked  ) <br/>\nOpen Lock: will open up to DC 53 locks (or DC 63 with +10 picks); consider this skill allocation as OPTIONAL only.<br/>\nSearch: only needs to be 42 (modified) for immediate detection of all default, but for PvP max level is recommended.<br/>\nSet Trap: maxed to set traps with detection levels beyond the capacity of most characters  (See Note 2 for examples) <br/>\nSpellcraft: +4 saves vs. spells<br/>\n<br/>\nNote:  In most environments, enough traps have been set for recovery and reuse or sold.  If not, and if components are available, the Craft Trap skill may be needed to supply an adequate trap inventory.  In vanilla, the strongest traps that can be crafted are the deadly versions (w/Acid Blob types unavailable).   Although a more economical means of gathering traps than buying them, notice that the components needed to craft them are much heavier than the finished trap.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>CRUNCH</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nAB Progression <br/>\nRegular attack: 3 APR (4 APR hasted) = +41/+36/+31 (/+41 hasted)  <br/>\nRapid Shot: 4 APR (5 APR hasted) = +39/+34/+29/+39 (/+34 hasted)<br/>\n<br/>\nDamage<br/>\nBase damage per hit w/shortbow: (1-6) - 1 = 1-5<br/>\nCrit frequency: 10% (19-20) of hits<br/>\nCrit damage per hit w/shortbow (base dmg x 3): 3-15<br/>\nSA damage per hit: 20-120<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Trap Strategy Suggestions</strong><br/>\nGeneral:  Trap management can take significant time and planning compared to spamming spells and H&amp;S.  However, once installation has been completed, it has the potential to control and kill sizable, powerful mobs and tough bosses very quickly and with a degree of safety few strategies can provide.  Also, it is one of the only ways for a non-cleric class to cause irresistible DIVINE damage (re: Holy traps) and thereby killing omni-immunes (like Demilichs).<br/>\n<br/>\nLearn the enemy.  This is mostly on-the-job training kind of education, but it will save you from wasting a lot of traps later on, so experiment on loners and small groups before planning a major battle campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\nDarkness scrolls (or crafted wands from allies) to help setting traps within perception range of the enemy.  Invisibility, sanctuary and stealth will always break during the final set trap animation (click sound), so against True Seeing/Ultravision users it is important to remain outside that range even when using Darkness. Use a \"divide &amp; conquer\" filter to separate all the detectors from the main force.  DO NOT use sanctuary effects in this maneuver!  Your rogue will need to be able to be targeted for True Seers to pursue and then kite back through the trap field.  Replace any triggered traps before engaging the remaining force.<br/>\n<br/>\nScrolls &amp; wands of summon creature can help to buy opportunity to set traps in a confined area as long as your PC can avoid being attacked or else elect Skill Mastery.  (Check out the BBoD exploit further down.) Tangle, Acid Blob and Sonic traps are usually the best controllers since the movement of several melee attackers can be slowed or stopped in their tracks. <br/>\n<br/>\n\"Horses for courses.\"  Steer enemies towards the type of traps that allow saves vs. their weakest. Unless you are facing a homogenous mob, it is desirable to set distinct \"subfields\" of traps with different save types in each subfield, guiding the closing mob towards the area that is most effective. If you cannot remain outside of the AoE of trap damage, set Tangle or single-target versions.  Use masses of stacked traps to assure that a few lucky dice rolls by the enemy will not foil your control.  If you notice that the majority are saving easily in one subfield, displace quickly and kite them towards another zone. <br/>\n<br/>\nUse herding (when possible) to get the highest number of targets per round jammed into an AoE field.  Regardless of which NPC triggers the trap, all within the AoE will get damaged (including party members/summons!).  Use the reverse logic utilizing single-target traps with secondary effects (like Frosties), spacing them so that a single enemy does not trigger several at once on a single target.  The secondary effect gets wasted though the stacked damage may kill them.<br/>\n<br/>\nArcher and caster enemies may be difficult to kite but still can be trapped with great patience, the enemy suffering trap damage off-screen oft times only noticeable by examining the combat log.  It is best not to tangle (slow) range attackers else the kite process (and killing rate) will slow proportionately (i.e. healing and regeneration are the enemy's allies with slow trap damage).<br/>\n<br/>\nNEVER set Negative Traps among undead.  They will be healed and they waste the secondary curse effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nALWAYS set more traps in a field than you expect to use.  (I generally set twice what is necessary to do the job.  Sometimes triple.)  Any left untriggered can be reused for the next encounter (Akkk! Blast those battle-ending cutscene thiefs!).  Recover them immediately so that neutral NPCs will not accidentally trigger them.  Fortunately, neutrals that DO succumb to your traps will not change your reputation or alignment.  Still, protecting non-hostiles is a matter of public courtesy for all except evil-aligned PCs, I suppose .<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen summoners use sacrificial creatures to navigate (pre-trigger technique) trap fields (if they suspect a field's presence with their \"spider sense\"), use scrolls of Dismissal or Hold Monster to prevent as much non-productive triggering as possible.  Summoners will often use wands to spam sacrificial creatures close to the attacking rogue's location and then command \"Follow\" as a recursive triggering method.  In anticipation, set a small Tangle trap zone and attack from just behind it.  The effect from a Tangle is probably the least recognizable by an enemy (they often mistake it for the casting of Slow) and a way of temporarily avoiding the detection of your field boundaries.  In general, high-level casters can make a wreck of a trap field once it has been located.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ultimate exploit for the trap specialist is the BBoD/Greater Sanctuary combo.  This is one version of using a summon to buy opportunity to set more traps, but in this case the summon is set as plot and invulnerable. The blade can be controlled via the radial to lead enemies in an exact pathway through the trap field, the trapmaster holding complete autonomy in the meantime.  Setting additional traps in combat will not break the blade's attack but attempting to recover one will.  Naturally, access to any spells via scrolls (per UMD) is required for a pure rogue master trapper.<br/>\n<br/>\nFind Traps can wreak havoc on trap fields.  But it requires the caster pursuer to be continually spamming the spell since they will not be able to visually detect them vs. DC  (Even their pixie is helpless to detect them!). The effective FT range is a 10-meter radius around the caster.  That's roughly about every dozen steps the caster advances.  For this reason, when casters are pursuing, set powerful fort &amp; reflex traps in the advanced position to paralyze them before they recognize that traps abound (see Acid Blob &amp; Frost versions).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#008000\"><strong>NOTES</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSpoiler<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t[+]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t1.  Combat with finessed weaponry (DEX Rogue 40)<br/>\n<br/>\nPROs of finessed melee (in a ranged attack build):<br/>\n- Provides a means to utilize the use of light melee weaponry, ideally with desirable weapon enhancements which may be unavailable on range weapons.<br/>\n- (The Crippling Strike feat) lowers both AB &amp; damage for all STR-based characters.  Yes, successive sneaks DO stack the STR-reduction effect, a permanent effect until countered with RESTORATION (like a curse, so resting doesn't restore).<br/>\n- Crit range: Rapier is intrinsically better than bow even with bow's Imp Crit feat applied<br/>\n- In close range, subject to fewer AoOs than ranged attacks<br/>\n<br/>\nCONs of finessed melee (in a ranged attack build):<br/>\n- No AC benefit switching from ranged attack to melee (w/o Shield Prof).<br/>\n- No weapon focus; -2AB compared to ranged; Epic Prowess substitution will help a bit.<br/>\n- Limited to 3 APR, 4 APR hasted (compare 4 APR/5 APR range attack w/RS).<br/>\n- Low/no discipline exposes toon to many called shots, knockdown effects and disarming.<br/>\n- Dangerous attack against recipro shields *ouch*<br/>\n- Taunt fodder.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat seems a powerful ability (i.e. Crippling Strike) at first examination, becomes problematic for any DEX-focused build and even more hazardous without a Discipline skill dump class available (like Fighter, Bard, etc.).  In actuality, the most difficult adversaries for rogues to manage are spell casters whose casting prowess will be relatively unaffected by Crippling Strike effects (except for increasing encumbrance), with notable exceptions to special builds like STR-based Battle Clerics and polymorphed mages using Balor or Death Slaad form, for example (neither Iron Golem nor Red Dragon are \"sneak-able/cripple-able\").  <br/>\n<br/>\nA secondary bane of a DEX-based pure rogue is getting flanked by several foes at once where there will be only a small proportion of sneaks being issued relative to the attacks per round being received, the constant threat of flat-footedness, inherent danger of traps while fighting within their AoE range and the Discipline deficiency (as mentioned above).  IMO Epic Dodge and Self-concealment are better utilized as insurance for forced PBS situations when it may be difficult to maintain an adequate kite distance and to deflect some enemy ranged damage rather than as a planned general equalizer for melee mobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Sample final trap DC values for this Rogue 40 build, DEX=34, maxed Set Trap, no related Skill Foci<br/>\n(Values shown in brackets [] indicate the level if ESkF: Set Trap is elected.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMinor example - Minor Acid Splash, this build:<br/>\nDetect DC  = 65 [75] (vs. Search skill classes: assassin, RDD, ranger. rogue, SD)<br/>\nDisarm DC = 77 [87] (vs. Disable trap skill classes: assassin, rogue)<br/>\n<br/>\nMedian example - Deadly Negative, this build: Detect DC = 69 [79], Disarm DC = 81 [91]<br/>\n<br/>\nMajor example - Epic Sonic, this build: Detect DC = 98 [108], Disarm DC = 113 [123] (Disarm trap: rogue only)<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  The screenshot is an example of the BBoD/Greater Sanctuary exploit in action with a Rogue 40.  All traps which did damage were set during combat with the toon taking about 60 points damage total by setting a few traps a bit too close to the action and getting hit by the edge of a couple of AoE dragon spells.  Though not shown, the prismatics (default blueprints, BTW) were near death when the shot was grabbed, a result of following the BBoD around a dense field of deadly version traps.  No epic traps were used, mainly because early in the encounter, the rogue was hit by some ability-reducing effect (Set Trap skill was apparently borderline  ).  Dragons cannot be stunned so the advantage of sonic traps is reduced to damge only, so the archer potential never entered the picture.  Not a single bowshot was used, but about 35 traps, mixed and mostly reflex types did the damage by battle's end.  The BBoD itself caused no more than about 50 physical damage via crits on 20 rolls.  All spells cast by the rogue were exacted by reading scrolls, 4 each of BBoD &amp; GS was necessary to place sufficient traps.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAny pure rogue facing a situation like this not armed with the scrolls and a boatload of traps should make out their last will and testament. </span><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The trade-off is the missing DEX AC.  So, essentially, this build attempts to cause more damage than it takes, and faster. The Shadow Crippler will get hit... a lot!  That means toe-to-toe combat and all the disadvantages that leads to.  Mob control becomes even more essential without the avoidance features of DEX-focused Epic Dodge and Self-Concealment in place, and for that reason, a rogue who intends to be successful in close range encounters will depend on the incapacitating effects of traps and innate reflexes to survive.  Durations for the paralyze and stun effects are long enough to consider it instant death via sneaks soon afterwards.<br/>\n<br/>\nPROS<br/>\n- High-APR makes it easier to stack the curse-like effects of Crippling Strike<br/>\n- High-damage per round; less dependant on sneaks<br/>\n- Can instantly detect, disarm and set all traps including epic ones<br/>\n- Sets very high detection DCs; opposed Search checks for most characters will fail<br/>\n- 5 APR when dual-wielding, 6 APR hasted<br/>\n- 22d6 sneaks<br/>\n- Reliable stealth and detection for most situations<br/>\n- Will avoid damage from spells with 1/2 reflex saves like fireball, firestorm &amp; chain lightning<br/>\n<br/>\nCONS<br/>\n- Low HP<br/>\n- Low AC <br/>\n- Lacks attack avoidance feats (ED,SC)<br/>\n- Conspicuously exposed to recipro damage shield effects, KD, disarming and DevCrit.

+1 Fort save vs. +1 Will save not a hard decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeats<br/>\nKukri vs. Dagger focus.  Exotic Prof costs 40 HP.   So, if you feel you really need Toughness to survive, focus in daggers instead.  On the other side of the ledger, the extra HP costs 10% crits and inability to gain even greater amount (12-20, 45%) with Keen Edge scrolls/wands (i.e. piercing vs. slashing).  Otherwise, the build and stats are identical.<br/>\n<br/>\nOpportunist for +4AB AoOs.  For setting traps often during combat, substitute Skill Mastery.<br/>\n<br/>\nEpic Skill Focus: Hide  &amp; Move Silently vs. ISA III &amp; IV. With respect to stealth checks, this is akin to gaining 20 DEX. In practice, the epic stealth boosts made much more of an all-around impact than 6 more SA avg damage, especially since this build seeks to optimize the potential of a pure rogue to deal with the most difficult creatures for them to harm, specifically crit/SA immunes.  Epic stealth \"appears\" to be more valuable than Epic detection in practice with a trapper class.  Traps are unaffected by opposing stealth so can be arranged to prevent a sneaker's approach, reducing the need of elevated Listen &amp; Spot skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nSkills<br/>\nHide &amp; Move Silently.  Linked to the associated Epic Skill Foci.<br/>\nSearch: only needs to be 42 (modified) for immediate detection of all default, but for PvP maxed level is recommended.<br/>\nSet Trap: maxed to set traps with the highest detection DC possible <br/>\nSpellcraft: +4 saves vs. spells<br/>\nDiscipline:  at 41, is effective to some degree against foes with attack levels in the low 40s or lower (better than spending an entire battle prone or without weaponry!).  Any further boosts to strength will help both AB and discipline checks.  Without electing Epic Skill Focus, this skill will be of little value so, in that case, distribute the points elsewhere.<br/>\nCraft Trap (not selected):  Depending on the availabilty of traps to purchase or recover, this may be a useful place to allocate spare skill points.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>CRUNCH</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nAB Progression<br/>\n1Hand attack: 3 APR (4 APR hasted) = +39/+34/+29 (/+39 hasted)  <br/>\nDual-Wield attack: 5 APR (6 APR hasted) = MH [+37/+32/+27 (/+39 hasted)] OH [/+37/+32]<br/>\n<br/>\nDamage<br/>\nBase damage per hit w/MH kukri: (1-4) + 10  = 11-14<br/>\nCrit frequency (MH): 30% (15-20) of hits  (or dagger 17-20: 20%)<br/>\nCrit damage per hit w/MH kukri (base dmg x 2): 22-28<br/>\n<br/>\nBase damage per hit w/OH kukri: (1-4) + 5  = 6-9<br/>\nCrit frequency (OH): 30% (15-20) of hits  (or dagger 17-20: 20%)<br/>\nCrit damage per hit w/OH kukri (base dmg x 2): 12-18<br/>\n<br/>\nSneak damage per hit (either hand): 22-132<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Trap Strategy Suggestions for Melee</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nBaiting a trap<br/>\nKiting is the easiest way.  Any range weapon will work, even wands via UMD.  Whether your rogue hits or not is secondary to luring enemies to start closing on your position.  Also, if you use a fan pattern, you can attract several widely-dispersed enemies at once without changing your attack location.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother interesting method is by using a summoned creature.  Toggle the command between Attack Nearest, Stand Ground &amp; Follow to guide its movement towards a point in the field.  Water &amp; Fire elementals are great to guide pursuers through fire trap fields, but even undead summons work well in gas and negative fields.  The downside is, of course, the XP drain while they exist.<br/>\n<br/>\nMelee within a trap field<br/>\nAvoid melee within the AoE trap radius.  Your rogue will receive the same damage as if an enemy trap was sprung (collateral effect).  If you must fight within a trap field stick to single-target and Tangle traps.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTrapping in coop<br/>\nIf you must use AoE traps, make sure your allies have either energy resistance or energy immunity protection before they begin to traverse your field(s) during combat.   Remember:  A summoner can set a creature right next to a PC ally and if they are standing within a trap's AoE range, they will get the full brunt of the trap damage as soon as the summon triggers it.  Their save level means nothing once the trap has triggered.  Generally, single-target types are the safest way choice, especially when mobs are closing from different directions.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Generally reserved for more swarthy classes, a rogue can still make its presence known as an instant-death threat.  By toggling equipment, the stealth penalties of using a shield (i.e. armor check penalty) can be controlled to prevent detection while closing.  The extra armor is always welcome in melee situations besides serving as a potential slot for magical enhancements.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\"><strong>The Rogue Class as a Character Build Adjunct</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nRogue is one of those infamous skill dump classes.  Or, to put it another way, a little rogue can go a long way to improving other classes.  Alone, without branching out into other classes, it has several weaknesses that need to be addressed in order to optimize its potential.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most straight-forward (to me, anyway), is to introduce a few levels of Fighter and/or Champion of Torm.  This satisfies at least 3 shortcomings... reliable Discipline in the strength build, addressing the no-crit/no-sneak damage problem with the specialization feats in DEX-focus and thirdly, the extra APR at BAB 16 can be reached for better combat effectiveness.   To a certain extent, Ranger levels have a similar effect though it takes 25 levels to gain the number of Favored Enemies needed to reach the +6 damage adder that 5 levels of fighter can achieve, though the damage bonus is race-specific.  The advantages of a Ranger's spellcasting, dual-wield capacity and animal companion is tempered by the armor restriction (if you decide to build a multi-faceted toon).<br/>\n<br/>\nDual-wielding Kukrimasters (eg. Rogue/Fighter/WM) are renown for causing astonishing amounts of damage per round.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a self-buffing sneaker, cleric levels can be introduced.  The buffs are so efficient, that it not only solves the APR limitation with Divine Power, but allows you to build a DEXER with some real punch even when not causing sneak damage.  The main issue would be to balance DEX with enough WIS so that the full effect of the buffs are realized without sacrificing too much AB.  And why not throw Monk into the mix to grab some extra AC and that sweet attack progression?  If so, hope you like swinging kamas.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAn arcane archer based on rogue is also very efficient.  Besides the instant ability to cut through DR and high AB (i.e. independence from magical bows), the ranged sneaks are that much more effective and in those cases where immunities interfere with huge SA/crit damage, the AA's innate damage is still significant, probably better than weapon specialization depending on the number of levels slotted.<br/>\n<br/>\nOut there somewhere on the edge of insanity (apologies to comrade Cin ) are those Epic Dodge/DevCrit deviates (aka Rogue/Bard/RDD).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the key weaknesses of a pure rogue are easily addressed by multiclassing with the advantage of the DEX-focused build bolstered sufficiently enough to dominate all types of creatures and situations.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh.  And... did I mention the benefits of Epic trap-setting?    <br/>\n<br/>\nDid I misunderstand what these \"Yardsticks\" are intended to convey?  At least the screen isn't blank!   <br/>\n*back to scrubbing the stains out my shorts*<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

When we spoke about you putting together a \"Family of Pure Rogues\" along with a bit about the pros and cons, etc. of the class and different approaches, I did not expect you to put such effort into it, but please know that I am very happy (ecstatic really) that you did. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of the yardsticks, where we are at currently, it is just that--a yardstick tool (as opposed to a precedent) as a means of comparison and of course for educational purposes as well, so as to have not just a \"yardstick\" for comparison among builds per se but also make building combinations that much more efficient (so as to perhaps inspire and/or encourage new builds around here as well, which if so is always a good thing!). What you have done here with your rogue \"guide\" is just plain wonderful, Hip, truly is. I am also very glad to hear that you yourself found the exercise to be both fun and educational, which clearly shows in your \"rogue guide\" as well, which is very informative, indeed. Excellent job, and thanks. Your next ale is on me!  <br/>\n<br/>\nIndeed, in the near future, I would like to see the \"project\" expanded into class guides and so forth, building and expanding upon what we as the ECB already have, to make building even more efficient as you say while at the same time serving as a useful tool in and of itself for educational purposes and measure of comparison; to this end, as a \"yardstick\" the project is coming along very nicely (and rather quickly I must say as well: thanks to everyone for your support on this and contributions thus far, please know it's all appreciated and a round for you guys as well, and thanks much again for this, Hip. Well done, I say again!).<br/>\n<br/>\nSneak ON! ~ Tyr<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
