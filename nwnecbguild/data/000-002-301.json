      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Just tested: It's the slot level that determines whether a spell is autostilled or not. I tested a wizard with Autostill Spell I &amp; II and had him cast an empowered IGMS while wearing full plate and a tower shield (95% arcane spell failure between the two). It failed nearly every time. No failure casting the non-empowered version.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">That's interesting.  So the casting level of the DC for the metamagic component (Empowered) is calculated as a level 6 spell, while AutoStill is treating it as a level 8 spell.  Then one could extrapolate the same results for the AutoQuicken &amp; AutoSilent versions as well, I suppose. (No need for further testing on my account, as I was only really interested in the Stilled effects.)  <br/>\n<br/>\nMuchas gracias, MrZork!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">De nada, HipMaestro. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe game seems to make the determination for auto-metamagic based on spell slot level and for DC based on spell level. I have added a note with an example to the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Metamagic\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NWNWiki metamagic entry</a> to make it a little more clear that it's the spell slot level that matters in determining whether a spell will benefit from an auto-metamagic feat.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
