Now, Fisher is a legendary bard, with many epic poems and ballads, composed over many years, to his name. In this particular tale, he is triggered into action - despite ordinarily being merely an observer and recorder of great events throughout history - and he proves exceptionally effective with his sword (my guess would be a rapier).<br/>\n<br/>\nTie this in with my turgid plodding through an attempt to play a full-blown caster (hating it, btw), and I wondered, is there a way to build a sort of Exalted Sorceress, but with maybe Bard and CoT instead of Sorcerer and Pally?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't see that there's any point going into a Build Request before canvassing opinion here first.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

These days, alas, you need 25 levels to be undispellable (though I don't play EE, I know most do, so with a heavy heart...).<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently posted a Bard 26/ Barbarian 4/ RDD 10 (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/viewtopic.php?p=23593#p23593\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lungar Sourkiss</a>), but haven't yet tested him, so he still dwells in the Build Requests forum. But you're right, Fisher ain't no barbar - and nor is he a BG.

And those can be taken out through spells, scrolls and UMD, I believe, which bard has in abundance.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, your effective UMD, provided you take 16 CHA, gives you opportunity to go for robes of Darkmoon very early. So one more attack, +4 AC, no problem with casting and pretty high AC thanks to high (should be about 20 if you take Tumble and don't forget about Expertise with its +5 to make it 25 for fights). Isn't that nice?<br/>\n<br/>\nThough I'm torn about making a DEX build that doesn't have Uncanny Dodge. Maybe a halfling and 3 rogue levels or human and thus just 2 levels of barbarian for UD and rage would do the trick.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with your build!<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my RMX1971 using Tapatalk<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Effectively, you need 6 of your 7 feats (8 if human) to get WM: leaving you to pick between Blind Fight, Knockdown, Imp Crit, Bard-specific feats (Curse Song, SkF: Perform, any spelly feats), and Weapon Finesse if Dexing.<br/>\n<br/>\nProblematic, to say the least.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

(There is some merit to the morningstar because it has two damage types so its damage will be resisted less often. It's just not that exciting because it's only a x2 critical multiplier.)<br/>\n\u00a0The following allows for exotic weapons:<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Bard(23), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Weapon Master(7), Human\nSTR: 16 (38)\nCON: 10 (12)\nINT: 14 (16)\n\n01: Bard(1): Dodge, Expertise\n03: Bard(3): Weapon Proficiency Exotic\n05: Bard(5)\n07: Red Dragon Disciple(2): (STR=19)\n09: Red Dragon Disciple(4): Mobility, (STR=22)\n11: Red Dragon Disciple(5)\n13: Red Dragon Disciple(6)\n15: Red Dragon Disciple(8): Whirlwind Attack\n17: Weapon Master(2)\n19: Weapon Master(3)\n21: Red Dragon Disciple(9): Epic Weapon Focus: Scythe, (INT=16)\n23: Weapon Master(5)\n25: Weapon Master(6)\n27: Bard(10): Armor Skin\n29: Bard(12)\n31: Bard(14)\n33: Bard(16): Great Strength II, (STR=34)\n35: Bard(18)\n37: Bard(20)\n39: Bard(22): Great Strength IV, (STR=37)\n\nSkillpoints: 286\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +6\nAB (max, naked): 44 (melee), 28 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Bard(6)\n\n\n01: Disable Trap(1), Listen(4), Lore(4), Open Lock(1), Perform(4), Taunt(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), \n03: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Lore(1), Perform(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), \n05: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Lore(1), Perform(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), \n07: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(6), \n09: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(12), \n11: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(3), \n13: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Listen(1), Save(1), \n15: Discipline(1), Intimidate(2), Listen(1), Save(1), \n17: Discipline(1), Save(8), \n19: Discipline(2), Listen(3), \n21: Discipline(2), Listen(1), Save(2), \n23: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(10), \n25: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(4), \n27: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(2), Taunt(3), Tumble(5), UMD(4), \n29: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(5), Taunt(1), \n31: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(4), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), \n33: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(4), Taunt(1), \n35: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(4), Taunt(1), \n37: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(4), \n39: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(4), Taunt(1), </details>\n\nOf course, a very similar build has been done before:<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build220640.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/buil ... 20640.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe main weakness of this build is that it can't wear heavy armor while it doesn't get Uncanny Dodge (so its AC will suffer when flatfooted, especially when taunting). On the other hand, it will get AC from bard buffs (bard song, curse song, taunt) so as long as it can keep up important immunities (freedom, mind spell immunity, knockdown immunity) and stay aware, maybe it will be ok. That would be one reason to build it as an elf, actually, to lessen the threat of sneak attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this probably wasn't so helpful but there was some talk about making weaponmaster work for a bard so I tried to design something good and I ended up with something very similar to something already done before.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
