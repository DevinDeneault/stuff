However, it's always worth keeping hold of the belts just in case, because their specific types of resistance will stack with the innate stuff and the feats, which can be useful in particularly challenging encounters.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

My DwD kept getting temporarily petrified by a magma elemental then battered by assorted earth elementals. I'd already got 30/-DR, but still kept pegging out, so tried slipping on a Greater Brawlers belt on my third reload. Still got petrified, but took no subsequent damage (having some regen equipment also helped). But what was particularly nice was that I was wearing armour that delivered electrical damage on a loop when hit. Killed four elementals while completely immobile. He-he.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT:</strong></em> Ninja'd by Grimnir. The belts do work in my experience (see main text of this post), but of course only for their particular damage type. I popped a screenshot of the said incident in \"The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly Thread\" in the General forum (it's on page 7).
