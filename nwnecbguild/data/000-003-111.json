      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hello, I'm looking to go through SoU and HotU on hardcore and I'm stuck with trying to build this character.<br/>\n<br/>\n I wanted\u00a0a PvM build up to level 28 as a Human with the class split of Bard 14/ BG 4/ RDD 10 since I heard that characters can only get up to 27-28 playing these campaigns. I ended up finding\u00a0this build which is basically exactly what I had in mind so I'm rolling with it with some <em>very</em> slight modifications.<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2350150/MOGHEDIEN-Melody-of-the-Dark-BARD-26-BG-4-RDD-10#.WAXDjvkrKCp\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/23 ... AXDjvkrKCp</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Str - 18 (33)<br/>\n Dex - 8<br/>\n Con - 12 (14)<br/>\n Int - 12 (14)<br/>\n Wis - 8<br/>\n Cha - 14 (16)<br/>\n<br/>\n Level Plan<br/>\n 01. Bard (1) - Power Attack, Cleave<br/>\n 02.\u00a0Bard (2)<br/>\n 03.\u00a0Bard (3) -\u00a0Curse Song<br/>\n 04.\u00a0Bard (4)<br/>\n 05.\u00a0Bard (5)<br/>\n 06.\u00a0Bard (6) -\u00a0Still Spell<br/>\n 07.\u00a0Bard (7)<br/>\n 08.\u00a0Bard (8)<br/>\n 09. BG (1) -\u00a0Weapon Focus (Greatsword)<br/>\n 10. BG (2) \u00a0<br/>\n 11. RDD (1)<br/>\n 12. BG (3) - Divine Might<br/>\n 13. RDD (2)<br/>\n 14. RDD (3)<br/>\n 15. RDD (4) - Knockdown<br/>\n 16. RDD (5)<br/>\n 17. RDD (6)<br/>\n 18. BG (4) - Blind Fight or Divine Shield<br/>\n 19. RDD (7)<br/>\n 20. RDD (8)\u00a0<br/>\n 21. RDD (9) - Epic Weapon Focus (Greatsword)<br/>\n 22. RDD (10)<br/>\n 23. Bard (9)<br/>\n 24. Bard (10) - Epic Prowress<br/>\n 25. Bard (11)<br/>\n 26. Bard (12)<br/>\n 27. Bard (13) - Armor Skin or Lasting Inspiration<br/>\n 28. Bard (14)<br/>\n<br/>\n So here are the troubles I'm dealing with:<br/>\n At character level 18 should I take blind fight? I've heard people say that it's a necessity for melee fighters but I think they meant for PvP. Will I be getting it's worth in SoU + HotU?<br/>\n If I don't\u00a0get blind fight, what should I take instead? I put up Divine Shield as a possible substitute but I'm open to anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\n At character level 27 should I take armor skin or lasting inspiration? I get that the extra AC is great but in the spirit of being a bard would lasting inspiration be an equal substitute?\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n My biggest problem is what to do with skills. I know I want to roleplay so I'd like to level up bluff and intimidate to a level where they won't be failing (like would 20 in each be enough for these campaigns?). I also know that tumble and perform are needed. But aside from that I have no idea where to go and I would really appreciate some input on this.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Also if possible can I get a recommended spell list?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

This build qualifies as \"feat-starved\" so you can expect to face some trade-offs in a build with less than 40 levels of wiggle room.<br/>\n<br/>\n You can't take Lasting Inspiration until at least Bard 20 (the actual prereq is: Bard Song 20).\u00a0 Cross off LI as part of this particular build.\u00a0 Deekin will elect LI if you get to him before he takes any RDD levels and make him a pure bard.\u00a0 But he won't use Curse Song either.<br/>\n<br/>\n Bluff checks are not used in either SoU or HotU.\u00a0 Those ranks would be wasted.\u00a0 Nor are Intimidate checks.\u00a0 More wasted skills there.\u00a0 But Taunt DOES work so perhaps consider that to complement your Curse Song?\u00a0 Just an idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n I haven't tried to plot this idea out yet but I'd start with STR 17 and boost DEX a bit more, at least to where there's no AC penalty (DEX 10).\u00a0\u00a0 Try not to end up with odd-numbered final abilities if at all possible.\u00a0 You'll get a bit more carrying capacity with that extra point in STR but that's about all.<br/>\n<br/>\n For skills, you'll need to max Discipline.\u00a0 Enough UMD to wear class-specific gear like monk boots if you desire to.\u00a0 If you are limiting your casting to buffs, you can forgo investing Conc because there is no opposed taunting to consider in those modules. Otherwise, you'll want many ranks to survive the damage interruption trying to cast offensives like Sound Burst. (Stilled Ice Storms will not be available, unfortunately.)\u00a0 As many ranks in Listen as you can afford.\u00a0 There are some drow mages that will use Invis and some clerics that use sanctuary to beguile your attacks.\u00a0 If you can hear them move around, it helps your targeting.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n I beleive I would focus on buffing my toon and party members if I were you.\u00a0 Bards have so few good offensive spells that casting during combat can open your toon up to many AoOs that would otherwise not become a factor.\u00a0 Keen Edge will help your Greatsword until you have access to the uber properties in Ch2 of HotU and then can be replaced by a less redundant buff.<br/>\n<br/>\n That should give you some homework to study until other members stop by to invest some of their own time to help.\u00a0 Good luck!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'm a little dissapointed that Bluff and Intimidate are pointless for roleplaying in SoU/HotU but that does free up points.

I don't recall any RP checks that require persuasion to be ultra-high, though, so am guessing 10-15 ranks plus your charisma should be sufficient.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

And if you find you've still got spares, maybe <em>Search </em>(even if you can't disable traps, you'll be able to find and avoid them - where possible) wouldn't hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, it's looking like 31 ranks in Discipline, 30 in Tumble, my guess would be 28 (net) in UMD (Hip's the expert in that, so I'm sure he'll correct me if I'm wrong), 27 in Spellcraft, 31 in Listen (or Spot), and any left over (should be about 20, afraid I haven't done the full calculation of your total available skills, but I reckon it'll be around 170) in Persuade/Search/Lore.<br/>\n<br/>\n Hope all goes well.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
