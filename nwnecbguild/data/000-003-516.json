I assume it must be custom if it is capped at level 30.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, please limit your request further.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFactors such as dual-wielding, weapon choice, STR vs. DEX (or vs. WIS for monk MC)... these all will have bearing whether a build will satisfy.  Multiclass preference?  Race preference?  Stealth or other skills? The more details the better.  Those all-purpose builds that try to satisfy every aspect of game play will always be inferior on the battlefield.</div>"

Ooookeee! *lol* Problem with rogue is low discipline so needs to try to get AC so high as to avoid any hits along with evasion, UD, etc.  I think a robed monk MC would be stronger and saves better.  The weapon choice is prohibitive though, so that may be too limiting depending on what the OP had in mind.  IIRC there are already a few Level 30 monk/cleric builds posted.\n<blockquote><div>\nYou will not get what you want in 30 lvls.

Also, keep in mind that PvP and PvM are two vastly different builds when you repost.  Tx!</div>"

The cleric balances it out, but still, rogue has more \"dex feats\".   I typically dont like cleric/rog btw.  Going cleric/monk, now you look at high wisdom, and then not melee.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI truly missed the vague requests.  Too bad people still dont know HOW THEY PLAY in order to be helped.</div>"

Probably uses the scrim as a two handed wpn as well, so DEFINITELY a strength based dude/ette!</div>"
