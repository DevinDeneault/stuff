Better AB also makes power attack more likely to hit.</div></blockquote>\nGood you are playing devil's advocate, it is\u00a0 the best way to improve builds<br/>\nEmpyre has provided some useful insights but I see something much richer than what he describes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAdvantages of Paladin vs Fighter<br/>\n1. Disease immunity from lvl 2<br/>\n2. +2 to saves from lvl 2, improves to +5 to 11 to saves by lvl 40, its like a double CoT 10 saves bonus with CoT 10/Paladin 3 but with 1/3rd to half of the saves not counting to the cap<br/>\n3. Fear immunity from level 3 (ie all those fear circles around undead and dragons you hate as a rogue that usually kill you? you can safely ignore from lvl 3)<br/>\n4. Eagles Splendor potions are suddenly useful<br/>\n5. +Cha gear is useful<br/>\n6. Divine damage is usually not resisted by opponents. Piercing/Slashing/Bludgeoning damage is a much more common damage damage resistance or reduction<br/>\n7. You can add Divine Might and Power attack together for +10-16 damage / hit vs +11 damage /hit<br/>\n8. You only need 3 paladin levels compared with fighter for EWS one will want 4 or 6. More rogue as a result.<br/>\n9. Ultra high fort save -&gt; Implosion, Dev Crit, Death Magic resistance<br/>\n10. Smite Evil 1/day for extra AB and damage, Lay on Hands for a free cure light/moderate per day<br/>\n11. Longer Divine Wrath duration (probably a situation where the saves cap might be hit)<br/>\n12. Paladin quest rewards and NPC conversation discussions open up to you<br/>\n13. The extra damage / hit from Divine Might, Power Attack or EWS is close to irrelevant when you can do up to 14d6 sneak, it is only relevant against sneak immunes. Defensive power is always relevant.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdvantages of Fighter vs Paladin<br/>\n1. Can dump CHA<br/>\n2. Bonus combat feats (to access ITWF)<br/>\n3. WS from Fighter 4 (+2 damage/hit)<br/>\n4. EWS epic levels (likely about lvl 21+, +4 damage/hit -&gt; +6 total)<br/>\n5. Extra damage is present all the time, not just when activated from Divine Might<br/>\n6. Can drop Divine Might and even power attack, saving one to two feats<br/>\n<br/>\nTo summarise:<br/>\nPaladin provides so much defensive power from just 1-2 levels and good offensive power too. One get so much right from the beginning which enhances playability as well.<br/>\nFighter is better for improved two weapon fighting and provides more offensive physical damage power than paladin as you mention with extra AB up to +3-4 perhaps.<br/>\nThe extra 2-3 AC from dumping CHA is less relevant with improved invisibility from UMD, large shield and epic dodge in the build<br/>\n<br/>\nGDL has already written a great Fighter/Rogue/CoT build in Gloomrazor of the Hin, as a junior builder I can't really add to that with his years of experience<br/>\nHowever I found something novel and unique which no one has thought about this class combo and amounts posting previously so I explored that and have posted that one up, to explore and dissect with everyone else<br/>\nThis one looks like a good catch to me during my fishing expedition.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to why not fighter instead? Perhaps the resulting answer is more philosophical Mick!<br/>\nThey say the best defense is a good offense, and I agree completely, however here's an interesting quote from Sun Tzu:<br/>\nInvincibility lies in the\u00a0<strong>defence</strong>; the possibility of victory in the attack.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I will have a look into it. As mentioned DM is only really there to deal with those sneak immune physical resistant PvM opponents that you can't damage except with divine damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will also want enough AB to hit things regularly whilst dual wielding hence I dropped the original CHA increases, they come pretty late in the build anyway and seem low yield to me for an ability I plan to only use occasionally.\u00a0Base AB 40 whilst dual wielding seems pretty good to me, if I'm flanking the effective base AB will be 42<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not keen to put both DM and DS in a build with only base 14 CHA though if I'm playing in a low-mid magic PvM environment and if I increase CHA too much the AB won't be enough.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAppreciate your commentary and review. I will likely make some adjustments and post an update.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Edit:</strong>\u00a0updated the build.\u00a0<br/>\nI like this one better, even the DM, which is reduced from 11 (with CHA capped) to 8 / hit, it gets two extra attacks / round which more than compensates I believe for a shorter duration and comparable damage<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Crit and Keen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I personally do not think the build will suffer much with reduced saves - provided one can substitute something else for them (like spells from scrolls, immunities, etc).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It comes into play in high magic environments, but also in mid magic at high levels if you find equipment that can cap saves. <br/>\nThe saves bonus from CoT is still of value in low magic environments and in mid magic situations where you cannot cap saves.<br/>\nDivine wrath even contributes further with its temporary saves bonus.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a way you can compare this to the AB bonus of cleric spells. They lose their value once items let you reach the AB cap.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
