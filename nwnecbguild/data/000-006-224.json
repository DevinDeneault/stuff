      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hail, mighty ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\n Now that I have internet and before RL comes crushing down on me again, I'd like to post this pretty cool build I devised a while back. The concept here is to make a defensive dwarven fighter that can hold his own in many situations. He can dual-wield if needed, or go sword / board for more AC, has EDR II, Defensive Stance, Sneak Attack immunity and Epic Dodge to round it up. He should equip Greater DR belts against each damage type depending on the enemy, and a Ring of Power just in case there's Darkfire involved. Not that he's easy to hit at all, which goes nicely with Regeneration. Scrolls of Negative Energy Protection and Shadow Shield are in order as well to protect against negative damage. The only tiny downside is that I was only able to get Epic Dodge at level 36 due to stat constraints. I could rework some stuff to add more CON at the cost of Strength, but I chose not to.<br/>\n<br/>\n You'd expect low AB for such a defensive build, but it reaches a surprising 41 AB unbuffed. Give him some DEX gear / Potions, and it goes up to 47, a +5 weapon for 52 and bless and Aid potions for 54 AB. If that's not enough, True Strike scrolls to KD people will raise your AB to 67 for 9 seconds. Coming in hidden will also help by negating Dodge AC of non True Seeing enemies. He has EWS in his Shortswords to help with damage and 7d6 Sneak Attack. And, best of all, since he's immune to SAs himself, he can ABUSE Darkness spells (from his enemies) and scrolls.<br/>\n<br/>\n You can set him up as a Tank with Defensive Stance and Damage Resistance items or as a more offensive combatant with Hide / Move Silently, Set Traps, UMD Darkness scrolls and IKD. Solo or in a party, this is a very hard to kill dwarf fighting machine!

and EDR. A different concept, even though using the same classes. He also gets fewer Fighter levels so no EWS.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, basically, although the concept has been done, I don't think it has been done quite like this. IMO this is as optimized as it can get for this concept, with the highest BAB possible, decent final AB with ways to raise it (or reduce enemy AC by negating Dodge bonuses), Trap Skills, Stealth Skills and the ability to stand in front of anyone, dodge some attacks and soak up the others. So, what are your thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The premise isn't that DR isn't all that useful (after all, as I said, I prefer the first one). The premise is that DR isn't cost-effective with the high CON investment it requires. In fact, I can use the stats the way you pointed out in the second one, as there's no reason not to start with 18 DEX. That would net me +1 AB. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were to do what you suggested, I would be tempted to drop DD to just enough to get Sneak Attack immunity (5 levels) and invest heavily in Rogue.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething like Rogue 19 DD 5 Fighter 16. That would net me the same BAB (4 Rogue levels pre-epic for skill dumps and trap updates, Fighter 11, DD 5). Then the extra Fighter levels in epics to take more feats, and with Rogue 19 I'd get Crippling Strike. I'm gonna work on that right away!<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, that is another build altogether. For this one, I fear the only viable tweak is to the starting stats. Very well suggested indeed, thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

But I will do anything I can to ignite some independent designing interest if at all possible.\u00a0 The fact is: Each of us have a shelf life and before mine expires I would like to instill a basic knowledge for as many newer players as possible to follow in my absence and, hopefully, to be able to contribute some new innovations of their own in the future.\u00a0 That may seem like pie in the sky at first reflection, but with all the new PWs with customizations that have evolved and that have little to do with default NWN, only the player of these worlds has enough insider info to tweak builds that will address the unique environments.\u00a0 And so we move forward...<br/>\n<br/>\n I suspect you are having difficult understanding the true nature of a \"tank\" due to your bias for SP content so I will explain.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Tanks are not supposed to be damage-dealers.\u00a0 If they can contribute high damage, then all the better, but that is not their main function.\u00a0 A tank is a moving wall from where the balance of the party can cast spells, snipe arrows or spring-and-peck-at mobs.\u00a0 They also act as a damage \"sink\" for the party.\u00a0 No doubt you've been introduced to the concept when playing a caster and needed either a sturdy summon or hench to act out that role for your \"weakling\".\u00a0 THAT is exactly what a DwD does. And the fact that Dodge is a prereq reinforces the fact that the class is designed to be shifty.\u00a0 Why dilute a STR focus class with a DEX requirement?\u00a0 You wouldn't... unless it was intended to bloom with DEX focus.\u00a0 Max recognized that fact so you'll see Epic Dodge, the ultimate tanking feat, appear.\u00a0 The RL tank needs infantry support or it is doomed.\u00a0 Study your history.\u00a0 When a mine field clears a tank push of all its infantry, some tanks may move on, but they are doomed by flanking attacks from tank busters without infantry to shoot the launchers.\u00a0 Same for DwD.\u00a0 It avoids AoOs like crazy and absorbs huge amounts of opposed damage allowing their \"infantry\" to inflict the main damage with realtive impunity.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, this not to say a DEX DwD cannot solo, but this one was never designed with that as primary focus.\u00a0 I often used a non-tank divine clc/DwD/rog Dexer to scout out a new server solo because it had high HP, was impossible to flank, could sneak well and did serious self-buffed damage with a mundane dwarven waraxe.\u00a0 The fact that the combo was so feat-starved only meant that I would not have much in terms of special attacks but you can't have everything, else no one would play any design but THAT one. *lol*<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Oh, and while my martial history studies only go from the Punic Wars to the Crimea, I get what you mean - scout positions, then use light infantry, supported by their heavy cousins and light cavalry establish a baulkhead, allowing medium infantry, artillery and heavy cavalry to consolidate, flank and decimate, moving things forward once more. 'Twas as true of Hannibal as Napoleon. I suspect I was thinking more defensively than offensively. Nonetheless, cheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I suffered from the same copy/paste annoyance as you, but stumbled on the remedy.\u00a0 All those Microsoft Office apps format the text and forumer hates the formatting.\u00a0 So just copy all cells to Notepad, then select all/copy the Notepad version to the forum editor (I use CTRL-V). The second copy purges the buffer of the formatted version and replaces it with the Notepad Unicode one.\u00a0 All done in two steps except your comments.\u00a0 Actually, I add another step from Excel to MSWord for a global clean-up before pasting to ECB so I can fit the class schedule and skill schedule in the same table to print-out on a single side of paper.\u00a0 Yes, I know you paste the thing into your journal so you'll skip that step I guess.\u00a0 Regardless of which way you go, the formatting must be stripped before pasting to forumer.\u00a0 I suspect Empyre knew this for a long time becuuse I never noticed any of the screwball spacing in any of his builds.<br/>\n<br/>\n I think that the more I play different PWs the more inclined I've become to go the DEX route as a utility scout.\u00a0 It just seems that it never gets hit, even by bosses, so you can take your time shredding them without concern and range attack is decent as well.\u00a0 Now, vs. DevCrit maybe not such a great idea.\u00a0 Too many chances for the attacker to get a lucky roll.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
