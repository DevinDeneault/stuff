      "content": "<div>I have recently posted all my NWN Henchman rebuilds, and in this endeavor that I went on with a friend of mine from WoG, he mentioned to me that he would love to see a build for his favorite mercenary in all of these games, which was Minsc (and Boo) from the Baldur's Gate series. So I was wondering whether any of you guys would be interested in seeing what I made for him and whether or not I should post him in the builds section. That's why I made this topic. So, who would like to see a NWN adapted build for Minsc?<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

I know there was Minsc, and Jaheira, and her husband (who IIRC dies before BG 2), then there was Anomen, and the rest I don't remember. I know there was a wizard lass as well. If you can remind me more of them and more about them, then absolutely, it should be fun. What was the name of that wizard (or was it a rogue) lass? I remember she was os a rich family and sort of disbanded into the world, or am I mistaking her for someone else? I think her name started with an N (Nelia, Nelda, Nalia, something like that). The truth is that back when BG was released, I had a very shitty computer, so I couldn't run it properly. I remember beginning to play the second BG (the first I played extensively, but don't recall much of either). It was something about a guy named Jon Irenicus, but TBH that's as far as my memory can go. PM me with the info on the henchmen and maybe we can work together, what do you say?<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

      "content": "<div>OK, so, after taking a look at the henchmen from BG, I realized I can't make builds for most of them. I only remember having played enough with Minsc (which I have a build for), Edwin, Aerie, Jaheira, Anomen and maybe Nalia and Imoen. There are many others that I never played. So, I wonder if there is anyone here in the ECB with enough knowledge of the Baldur's Gate saga to actually embark on a crusade to translate these builds to Neverwinter Nights. I would gladly help.

      "content": "<div>The biggest challenge if you want to build BG henchmen for NWN is to translate the AD&amp;D 2nd edition builds to D&amp;D 3rd edition rules, (or the bioware interpretation of the D&amp;D 3rd edition).<br/>\nIn BG you rolled your stats (con, dex, wis etc), roughly as a 3d6 roll for every stat with some modifications based on class and race. In NWN you buy stats with a fixed number of buy points available and get further stat increases with levelling. What exactly the stats do for the character differs greatly between the 2nd and 3rd edition rules. AB, saves, skills, proficiencies and feats were also totally reworked with the 3rd edition, and so were also the rules for multiclassing.<br/>\nIf you want to build a Minsc copy for NWN, you must try to figure what the essence of the character is and try to recreate that according to the 3rd ed rules. Basicly that is a very strong warrior type human, not that bright and offering one and only one standard solution to every problem (high str, low int and wis). I would multiclass him with barbarian for his attitude and rage and ranger for a pet (sorry, but no hamsters companions in vanilla NWN) and for FE (vs gnolls wasn't it) and stealth skill etc.</div>",

Minsc is a very strong Ranger with a Brown Bear (space hamster) companion named Boo, wielding a Halberd and having the Barbarian Rage feat, which is equivalent to Berserker ability in BG.

The problem is that in all these games, they don't build well for the henchmen / party members. My aim when doing this was to powerbuild as much as I could to sort of \"make due\" to these great characters with strong builds that would still match their stories. Going WIS 10 would make him weaker while adding little RP value. You'd make him unable to cast spells without changing virtually anything else. But on the other hand, those points could go to Constitution and make him tougher, so that's a valid point. Starting with Barbarian isn't, however, as that would mean only one Taunt dump at lvl 39, so that's why I chose to keep things that way. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the Companion, all you have to do is change the companion to Dire Rat if you want. Unfortunately, they are REALLY BAD and would die constantly in Neverwinter Nights, so what you'd manage with this alteration is to have Boo be unsummoned most of the time in-game, which is why I chose the bear. At least you'd be able to see Boo in-game for more than three seconds :&gt;D<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally the weapon: this is pretty much anyone's choice. You can change the weapon to Greatsword if you want. I used to equip him with a two-handed sword IIRC, but Valerfor, who's helping me with this, told me to make him a Halberd user, and he's played the game much more than I , so I followed his lead.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the feedback.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"
