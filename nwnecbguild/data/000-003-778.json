      "content": "<div>This build is very much inspired by Maximillan Kane.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope he is enjoying life wherever he is!<br/>\n<br/>\nI've made some adjustments to his great build to add divine damage and delightful saves from Divine Grace. I think a Base AB of 38 would be good enough with all the cleric goodness available.<br/>\n<br/>\nA base Cha of 24 when capped at 36 would mean a 13 round duration divine might +13 divine damage per hit, which could be up to 5 times / round with DP and haste.<br/>\n<br/>\nI took cons 8 because of undispellability + endurance should be enough to boost the HP up enough. Mords will be a worry but thankfully with the caster levels one should be somewhat mord resistant<br/>\n<br/>\nIdeal domains I thought would be Travel (for undispellable extended haste yes please!) and Trickery (again undispellable improved invisibility yes please!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd some skill points to keep the trap setters happy! hooray!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway haven't play tested it so I've put this in the unfinished section!<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Cleric(38), Monk(1), Paladin(1), Human\nSTR: 14\nCON: 8\nINT: 14\n\n01: Paladin(1): Point Blank Shot, Power Attack\n03: Cleric(2): Divine Might\n05: Cleric(4)\n07: Cleric(6)\n09: Cleric(8): Rapid Reload\n11: Cleric(10)\n13: Cleric(12)\n15: Cleric(14): Extend Spell\n17: Cleric(16)\n19: Cleric(18)\n21: Cleric(20): Epic Weapon Focus: Heavy Crossbow\n23: Cleric(22)\n25: Cleric(24)\n27: Cleric(26): Great Charisma I, Great Wisdom II, (WIS=22), (CHA=18)\n29: Cleric(28)\n31: Cleric(30)\n33: Cleric(32): Great Charisma III, Great Wisdom IV, (WIS=24), (CHA=22)\n35: Cleric(34)\n37: Cleric(36)\n39: Cleric(38): Great Wisdom VI, Great Wisdom VII, (WIS=27)\n\nSkillpoints: 217\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8\nAB (max, naked): 28 (melee), 38 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Cleric(9)\n\n\n01: Concentration(4), Disable Trap(1), Discipline(4), Open Lock(1), Search(2), Set Trap(2),\u00a0\n03: Concentration(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Spellcraft(1),\u00a0\n05: Concentration(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Spellcraft(1),\u00a0\n07: Concentration(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(2),\u00a0\n09: Concentration(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n11: Concentration(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(6),\u00a0\n13: Concentration(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(8),\u00a0\n15: Concentration(1), Set Trap(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(12),\u00a0\n17: Concentration(1), Set Trap(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(16),\u00a0\n19: Concentration(1), Set Trap(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(20),\u00a0\n21: Concentration(1), Set Trap(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(24),\u00a0\n23: Concentration(1), Set Trap(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(28),\u00a0\n25: Concentration(1), Set Trap(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(32),\u00a0\n27: Concentration(1), Set Trap(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(36),\u00a0\n29: Concentration(1), Set Trap(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(40),\u00a0\n31: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(46),\u00a0\n33: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(52),\u00a0\n35: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(58),\u00a0\n37: Concentration(1), Save(65),\u00a0\n39: Concentration(1), Save(73),\u00a0</details>\n<strong>Edit:</strong>\u00a0I'm a sucker for UMD, so if you want this, drop paladin and take one level of monk at level 21 and one level of rogue at 40...</div>"

      "content": "<div>Yeah Travel / Trickery would apply for non-WoG<br/>\n<br/>\nRE: WoG<br/>\nSehanine Moonbow requires one to be chaotic good or chaotic neutral :( so no can do if we want paladin in this<br/>\n<br/>\nI know Animal and Plant is considered optimal... Heironeous? Law and War domains might not be too bad. Battle mastery duration is 5 rounds + charisma modifier, so 20 rounds with +7 AB/damage is pretty sweet. Law domain to access the lesser mind blank spell which will be undispellable with all those cleric levels. Plus aura of vitality / cats grace is pretty good. St Cuthbert might not be too bad either for Strength / Law domains / protection</div>"
