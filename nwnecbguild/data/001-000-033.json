      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Quick question - I've been using \"Totally Neverwinter Nights\" as my base version of the game (consists of the 3 official mods, v1.69), but had a couple of minutes to spare while waiting for a train earlier, and in a second-hand games shop there was a \"Neverwinter Nights - Deluxe Edition\" (again, all 3 official campaigns, v1.69). It was only \u00a33.50, which is about $4-and-a-bit. Is there any apparent difference between the products? Ignoring the second-hand nature of the one I've just seen, is it a \"better\" product?<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
