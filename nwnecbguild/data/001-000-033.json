      "content": "<div>Quick question - I've been using \"Totally Neverwinter Nights\" as my base version of the game (consists of the 3 official mods, v1.69), but had a couple of minutes to spare while waiting for a train earlier, and in a second-hand games shop there was a \"Neverwinter Nights - Deluxe Edition\" (again, all 3 official campaigns, v1.69). It was only \u00a33.50, which is about $4-and-a-bit. Is there any apparent difference between the products? Ignoring the second-hand nature of the one I've just seen, is it a \"better\" product?<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers</div>",

      "content": "<div>The UK <em>Deluxe</em> is the US <em>Platinum</em>.\u00a0 IIRC, that's a DVD.\u00a0 The <em>Totally</em> is the same compilation, available only in UK, but on CD(s).\u00a0 DVD installs quicker, but that's about all the difference, Stagmeister.\u00a0 The toolset has come packaged in all versions ever since its initial release in 2002 although some game versions contain updated Aurora toolset software.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want access to more Bioware content like the Premiums, either DL Diamond from GoG or buy it new/used through ebay, Amazon or other third party vendor.\u00a0 It's normally 10 USD through GoG, but if you are willing to wait, they reduce it to about half that price during promotional periods like some holidays.\u00a0 Just steer away from copies without CD Keys.</div>"
