      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">In that case, I suggest pure Cleric with 15 STR and 12 INT, lowering DEX to 8 to allow that. The 4 skills you would maximize would be Concentration, Discipline, Spellcraft (to 29), and Tumble (to 30). Boost STR at level 4, and all other boosts go to WIS. Divine Power will (briefly) boost your STR to 18, and then Bull's Strength will boost it further. If you can work Divine Might and/or Divine Shield in there, that would be a bonus. I would make the build for you, but it would actually teach you more if I (and others) describe the build, and you make it.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Oh yeah, and you'll have to cross-class Tumble to 15, not 30, as well. If you go that route, put those 4 CoT levels in epic, and use the feats for Epic Prowess and Armor Skin. Having fewer levels of Cleric does weaken your spell penetration (vs the enemy's Spell Resistance), though. You don't want to take 4 CoT pre-epic because you want to get the 4th attack from Divine Power, not from BAB. If you get the 4th attack from Divine Power, it will be at full AB, but if you get it from BAB, it will be at full AB - 15.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
