This, sadly, is missing from HOTU and I believe SOU as well. This is a long shot but has anyone ever seen downloadable dialogue scripts to change this? Could this be done? \"Grogg want talk like real strong half-orc when he go Underdark! NOT SISSY ELF!\"\u00a0 \u00a0</div>"

I think you have to write a separate set of dialogue lines that kick in after an intelligence check. <br/>\nIt would be fun though if somebody came up with a tranlator between English and stoopid English.<br/>\nThat would make this tedious work a bit easier.</div>",
