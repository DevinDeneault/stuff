      "content": "<div>Hail, mighty guildsmates!<br/>\n<br/>\n So, recently, I've been thinking about the repercussion of some of our posts in people's NWN play over the years. I was skimming through the WoG forums, and I found a post by Campgod saying how he got to the forums by searching for builds by GDL and myself. Then he found his way here and we interacted a lot. There was also another newer player on WoG who found the server through the ECB and was playing my Demolition Man build, then another one who I met\u00a0in-game and was playing a variant of Valerfor's Iron Fist build.<br/>\n<br/>\n However, in all these years as a member of this guild, one thing has always bugged me. I've known some of you guys for so long, discussed hundreds of builds with you, but we've never actually played together! I've only played this game alongside\u00a04 of our members: Valerfor, BlackCobra, Conlaoch\u00a0and HipRedux. Don't you guys find this odd? I would love to play alongside one of Mick's Assassins (as long as his blade is pointed at the enemy LOL), or TyrTemplar's renowned meleers, and see how much progress Stagmeister has made since his OC days (or are you still playing that crap? LOL)\u00a0the same was I was able to see one of HipRedux's resourceful Rogue builds in action about 5 years after we met in the old ECB :D. It was long overdue!<br/>\n<br/>\n So I feel like this is an anomaly that needs to be rectified. I formally invite all ECB members who are still around, both older and newer members, for a live session of play. I would prefer it if we played on WoG, as I love that server, and I think it's as\u00a0balanced as a server can be,\u00a0but I'm actually open to play anywhere, even SP modules hosted by one of you guys (my internet connection is crap, so I can't do it). Anyone is welcome to join. If you're a newer player, you can pick up a trick or two along the way :D.<br/>\n<br/>\n What say you, fearless adventurers?</div>"

Get to work on those issues ASAP and let us know when you're done. It'd be great to have you along. The offer stands.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>I realize this may sound tantamount to heresy considering our new residence was contrived by Kail who was a staunch WoGger with many build recommendations based on that environment and pantheon, but nonetheless... When is the last time you've played around with Funky's Higher Ground PW? That's where I usually head these days when not committed to one of our LAN group's outings because it suits my personal situation much better than WoG's current status. The situation would be shorter sessions, usually with pre-epic builds because it's too hard to arrange for extended periods to get very far into epic. The server almost never goes down and when it does, there is an upgrade or maintenance announcement a few days in advance and always at least a handful of players around the same level to welcome another partymate. ATM I keep about 4 toons of various levels ready for participation but am always willing to start a new one when the need arises (those low level builds can really pile up if you let them!). Basically, I like to be able to log for a few hours once in a blue moon and have some party fun. Solo play I reserve for SP modules only which is really not Dungeons and Dragons gaming (no DM man!) so the immersion is based on RPG value rather than my true interest. Just a thought...</div></blockquote>\n\n Hey dude. I have never played there, but I went to the website and there seems to be too many custom modifications that I dislike. I didn't have much time to look deeper into this (last minute trip came up, I'm leaving tonight), but I was reading the books of class changes and some of the stuff just looks iffy to say the least (balance-wise). Legendary Levels, SD being immune to death magic and becoming ethereal (WHAT?), PM STR halving bone armor bonus, etc... The server might be nice to play on, with cool quests and all, but I have to be honest to say that I'm not eager to try it out based on what I read. As I said, WoG is my preferred server, firstly because you're familiar with it, which would make the situation somewhat easier, and second because the only major changes that impact gameplay are not done to classes (Most remarkably the upgraded Crafting and Summoning systems). Basically, as far as classes go, they're pretty much the same as vanilla NWN, which provides a solid ground for us to play our builds without fear of finding out that they don't actually work as intended\u00a0due to\u00a0some custom implementation. The ONLY custom change that affects classes is Cleric Domain Restriction based on Race, God and Alignment. But, since I'll be the Cleric, that won't be an issue LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also,\u00a0apparently there was a problem with Raine's system and NWN that was making it quite buggy, but it seems to have been resolved. BC and I have been adventuring almost every weekend for at least 2 months and there have been\u00a0almost no\u00a0issues. About sessions, WoG has many short quests and some\u00a0long ones. There's plenty to keep us busy. If you want to level from 1-40 doing only short quests, it may not be possible, as two of the higher epic quests are quite long, but there are two epic bosses who are just around the corner and can be done in a couple of hours as well. And we can make this a regular thing, like every Saturday, for example. The idea is to play a party (we could even do a theme party if you're up for it) of toons that we save up exclusively for that purpose. We could even make a party of \"Favorites\", where we play our favorite ECB builds. Are you up for it?<br/>\n<blockquote><div> Sure ot would be great to meet up with you guys in game. My schedule is a bit limited though. My time zone is CET (GMT+1) which differs between 6 and 9 hours from the american zones. I can play from 8pm to 12pm CET some nights. That is late night in Asia and afternoon in America. But let's see what we can do! </div></blockquote>\n\n I'm terrible with time zones, so let me just say that right now it's 9:41 AM here in Rio de Janeiro (take a look at the time I made this post and you can figure out the difference LOL). I normally have time to play on Saturdays, but not today because of the trip I mentioned above. Does that work for you guys? We could start next Saturday if you guys are available. Saturday afternoon would be perfect for me, evening is fine too. I'm 3-5 hours ahead of US time zones, so something like 5 PM my time might fit everyone's schedule. It'd probably be 6-7 PM Mick's time and like 2 PM Hip's time.<br/>\n<br/>\n What do you guys think?</div></div>"

You don't HAVE to be there every session, but if you can join occasionally, it would work well. The only thing that would be hard is if you're gone too long, because there's a 4-level gap rule for parties. So as long as you're within 4 levels of the rest of the group, you should be fine.<br/>\n<br/>\n @Stag<br/>\n<br/>\n Dude, the server is hard, but we are ECB elite, so we are more than up to the challenge. These days I played with a newer player who made a toon on WoG. He died SO MANY TIMES and even caused me to die a couple of times. If you don't know a lot about the game, WoG is BRUTAL. The bosses there are insanely well-built, and if you play like you do in the OC you might not even make it past the first encounter. I remember some of the HotU battles, where I ran into the hordes of evil with my summoned Air Elemental and came out unscathed. LOL. It's not even the same game.</div></div>"
