      "content": "<div>What would be your favourite build if you played somewhere where there was a very low max level limit? What is your strongest level 1 character, your best level 2 character, level 3 character etc?<br/>\n<br/>\nAll normal character development takes us through the early Levels, and you normally play more low level characters than high level characters since you don't take all characters to\u00a0mid- or high levels. Many mods also end before level 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt low levels\u00a0life can be really hard. Your character has few hitpoints, low AB, bad equipment, and can suffer one hit kills. Power comes at intervals and different classes have different points at which they gain that extra power. Eg; Warrior classes get an extra attack at level 6, casters get new spell levels at every second Level. Fighters gain a lot of feats early on. Rangers get a pet at Level 6 etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what is your level 1 powerbuild, level 2 powerbuild etc?</div>",

Two of which i have good memories of, are \"Conan Chronicles-Legion of the Dead\" and \"Lord of the Rings-Sons of the Steward\". <br/>\nBoth are relatively short in comparison to \"Saleron's Gambit\" but well-made adventures with fantastic music themes.</div>"

However, part of this Guild's underpinning premise is to create builds that remain strong regardless of environment (bar some minor tinkering). Any potential game-changing environment-specific issues can be addressed when a build is first requested/conceived, as has been done in the past. For example, and on a simplistic level, anyone wanting to use a build solely to play the OC won't be focused on Dwarven waraxe. Equally, and more particular to your example, if pick locks is a necessary skill at such early levels as this thread is concerned with, shouldn't the module's author be letting players know that prior to beginning - else they will just be nerfing their own endeavours? The presumption here is vanilla, and that includes levels and types of equipment/consumables available unless told otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. That was a question that concerned me on the first page of this thread, and I think the answer is no, these builds are about being among the strongest at their stated level, not the previous or any later one(s). And that's why they're on the General Discussion sub-forum rather than anywhere else.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you enjoy your time with us!</div>",
