Arcane archer build, elf or half-elf.<br/>\n2. EDR III, 500+ base HP -&gt; to tank for parties<br/>\n3. Base AB 40+, both melee and ranged.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Outcomes:</strong><br/>\n- 626 hp, EDR III (physical damage reduction 9/-), Fort 28 (36) / Will 17 (27) / Reflex 24 (32), +8 AC from Tumble 40. Saves against spells are in () brackets.<br/>\n- Warhammer and Tower, Str 26, Base melee AB 41, Blind Fight, Improved Knockdown, WF/EWF/EP, WS/EWS, improved critical, called shot, +14-20 damage/hit with mundane warhammer<br/>\n- Longbow, Base ranged AB 45, +13-21 damage / mundane arrow (11 from enchant arrow, 2 from WS, 0-8 from mighty property), blind fight, point blank shot, called shot, improved critical<br/>\n- 220 skillpoints, max discipline, tumble 40, spot 40, UMD 30 modified, perform 9 modified, search 9 modified, set trap/disable trap/open lock single ranks,\u00a0Level 3 Bard song<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Design notes:</strong><br/>\n- This borrows from two of Grizzled_Dwarflord's builds, the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build254793.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Half-Elven Soldier of Fortune</a> (a strength warhammer/longbow half-elven build) and <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build219413.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Iron Archer</a> (a dexterity EDR III longbow/weapon finesse elven build).<br/>\n- It strikes a reasonable middle ground between the two, and rather than go dexterity based, I have chosen to go strength based, for more damage, to be able to equip/carry heavy armor and tower, and the fact I don't have uncanny dodge<br/>\n- It doesn't have the 50+ AB of a dexterity AA build, if you are looking for this, look elsewhere. But there is enough AB in this build that if you compare it with non-AA builds there is plenty.<br/>\n- Half-elf was chosen because it is easier to obtain EDR III with that race compared with elf, dexterity was not a focus, to avoid exp penalties, and for novelty (we need more half-elf builds). In many ways I believe half-elf is superior to elf in this build, given it is designed to tank, have a useful melee attack and a ranged attack as well.\u00a0<br/>\n- Called shot was chosen over rapid shot because it can be used in both melee and ranged, and there are lower requirements for this feat.\u00a0<br/>\n- From a lore perspective, the Seldarine is\u00a0the\u00a0elven\u00a0pantheon of gods that resides on the\u00a0astral dominion\u00a0of\u00a0Arvandor\u00a0under the leadership of\u00a0Corellon Larethian. The Resilient Hammer of Seldarine, is therefore, the the enduring and hardy representative of the elven gods.<br/>\n- Min-maxing for level 40 power can be done by going Fighter 16/Arcane Archer 22/Bard 2, in this build I choose to drop the AA 22 bonus feat (which would be either Epic Reflexes or Epic Toughness in this case) for a mid epic skill dump, this is to allow for smooth playthrough during single player modules.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nConstructive comments / suggestions / tweaks welcome as always<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Fighter(16), Arcane Archer(21), Bard(3), Half-Elf\nAny non-lawful\nSTR: 16 (26)\nCON: 16 (22)\nINT: 14\n\n01: Fighter(1): Toughness, Blind Fight\n03: Fighter(3): Point Blank Shot\n05: Fighter(5)\n07: Fighter(7)\n09: Bard(1): Improved Knockdown\n11: Arcane Archer(2)\n13: Arcane Archer(4)\n15: Arcane Archer(6): Improved Critical: Longbow\n17: Arcane Archer(8)\n19: Arcane Archer(10)\n21: Fighter(10): Epic Damage Reduction I, Epic Damage Reduction II\n23: Fighter(11)\n25: Fighter(13)\n27: Fighter(15): Great Strength II, (STR=18)\n29: Bard(2)\n31: Arcane Archer(13)\n33: Arcane Archer(15): Great Strength IV, (STR=22)\n35: Arcane Archer(17)\n37: Arcane Archer(19)\n39: Arcane Archer(21): Great Strength VI, (STR=25)\n\nSkillpoints: 220\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8, Mind Effects: +2\nAB (max, naked): 41 (melee), 45 (ranged)\nSpell Casting:\u00a0\n\n\n01: Disable Trap(1), Discipline(4), Open Lock(1), Set Trap(1), Save(6),\u00a0\n03: Discipline(1), Save(12),\u00a0\n05: Discipline(1), Save(18),\u00a0\n07: Discipline(1), Save(24),\u00a0\n09: Perform(4), Spellcraft(8), Tumble(10), UMD(11),\u00a0\n11: Search(3),\u00a0\n13: Spot(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n15: Spot(1), Save(15),\u00a0\n17: Spot(1), Save(25),\u00a0\n19: Spot(1), Save(35),\u00a0\n21: Discipline(1), Save(30),\u00a0\n23: Discipline(2), Save(35),\u00a0\n25: Discipline(1), Save(41),\u00a0\n27: Discipline(1), Save(47),\u00a0\n29: Discipline(1), Perform(3), Spellcraft(10), Tumble(20), UMD(20), Save(2),\u00a0\n31: Spot(6),\u00a0\n33: Spot(1), Save(8),\u00a0\n35: Spot(1), Save(18),\u00a0\n37: Spot(1), Save(28),\u00a0\n39: Spot(1), Save(38),\u00a0</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
