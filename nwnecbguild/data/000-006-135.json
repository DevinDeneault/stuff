      "content": "<div>If you play online games, you most certainly have met him already. If not, you are bound to sooner or later. (I would say sooner). I am talking about the annoying little bastard called<br/>\n<br/>\nTHE EPIC MUNCHKIN<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is of course a Gnome. <br/>\nSmall and weak, immature and lacking basic social skills. <br/>\nHis assets are his brilliant intellect and his constitution (despite severe lack of physical exercise). This makes him extremely inventive and hard to kill.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is of course a wizard (favored class and everything), and it fits his abilities superbly.<br/>\nHowever, he has a greater dream! He wants to become a sword master, the ultimate \u201cFrag Man\u201d. He follows that dream with great determination and imagination until he finally reaches his peak at level 40.<br/>\nOn his travels his companion, a Dragon called \u201cTuff\u201d, follows him. (To everyone else it is a fairy dragon, but the little gnome sees things differently.)<br/>\n<br/>\nStats:<br/>\nStrength: Average for a gnome - 9<br/>\nDexterity: Nothing special, but a small bonus for his keyboard and gamepad handling - 11<br/>\nConstitution: Gnomish endurance - 17<br/>\nWisdom: Immature and narrow minded - 8<br/>\nIntelligence: He handles the meta-abstract very well and can explain the pros and cons of the current programming of the latest video card drivers - 18<br/>\nCharisma: Annoying and lacking basic social skills - 8<br/>\n<br/>\nFeats:<br/>\nHe takes combat feats as his general feats and metamagic as bonus feats: <br/>\n<br/>\nSkills:<br/>\nHis high intelligence enables a large number of skills. He knows everything about computer programming and thinks he knows a lot about medieval weaponry. This gives him a high lore skill so he can identify any \u00fcber items on the spot. <br/>\nHe can also craft weapons and enchant them with his magic so he can sell loads of magically enhanced swords until he has enough gold to buy more \u00fcber items. <br/>\nThe skill selection further supports the idea of a mage striving to become a sword master:<br/>\nConcentration 43(49), Craft Weapon 13(20), Discipline 28(38), Heal 43(42), Intimidate 4(3), Lore 43(50), Spellcraft 43(50), Taunt 16(15), Tumble 20(21)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlignment:<br/>\nHe will probably pretend to be good - or more likely - dressed in black and evil, but judged from his actions he is a typical Chaotic Neutral.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel, feat and ability progression<br/>\nWizard (33), Sword Master (7), Gnome<br/>\nCN<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nSTR: 9 (10)<br/>\nDEX: 11 (13)<br/>\nCON: 17 (18)<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 18 (24)<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nGnome:<br/>\n01: Wizard(1): Weapon Proficiency Martial, {Scribe Scroll}<br/>\n02: Wizard(2)<br/>\n03: Wizard(3): Weapon Focus: Longsword<br/>\n04: Wizard(4): DEX+1, (DEX=12)<br/>\n05: Wizard(5): Extend Spell<br/>\n06: Wizard(6): Expertise<br/>\n07: Wizard(7)<br/>\n08: Wizard(8): DEX+1, (DEX=13)<br/>\n09: Wizard(9): Dodge<br/>\n10: Wizard(10): Empower Spell<br/>\n11: Wizard(11)<br/>\n12: Wizard(12): INT+1, Mobility, (INT=19)<br/>\n13: Wizard(13)<br/>\n14: Wizard(14)<br/>\n15: Wizard(15): Spring Attack, Maximize Spell<br/>\n16: Wizard(16): INT+1, (INT=20)<br/>\n17: Wizard(17)<br/>\n18: Wizard(18): Whirlwind Attack<br/>\n19: Weapon Master(1): Weapon of Choice: Longsword<br/>\n20: Weapon Master(2): CON+1, (CON=18)<br/>\n21: Weapon Master(3): Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword<br/>\n22: Weapon Master(4)<br/>\n23: Weapon Master(5)<br/>\n24: Weapon Master(6): STR+1, Epic Prowess, (STR=10)<br/>\n25: Weapon Master(7)<br/>\n26: Wizard(19)<br/>\n27: Wizard(20): Knockdown, Combat Casting<br/>\n28: Wizard(21): INT+1, (INT=21)<br/>\n29: Wizard(22)<br/>\n30: Wizard(23): Improved Knockdown, Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor<br/>\n31: Wizard(24)<br/>\n32: Wizard(25): INT+1, (INT=22)<br/>\n33: Wizard(26): Improved Critical: Longsword, Epic Spell: Epic Warding<br/>\n34: Wizard(27)<br/>\n35: Wizard(28)<br/>\n36: Wizard(29): INT+1, Armor Skin, Improved Combat Casting, (INT=23)<br/>\n37: Wizard(30)<br/>\n38: Wizard(31)<br/>\n39: Wizard(32): Epic Skill Focus: Discipline, Epic Spell: Dragon Knight (<em>He finally gets a real Dragon by his side</em>)<br/>\n40: Wizard(33): INT+1, (INT=24)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHitpoints: 362<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 20/20/20<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +10, Mind Effects: +2<br/>\nBAB: 21<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 27 (melee), 24 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 18/18<br/>\nSpell Casting: Wizard (9)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nSkillpoints: 293<br/>\nConcentration 43(49), Craft Weapon 13(20), Discipline 28(38), Heal 43(42), Intimidate 4(3), Lore 43(50), Spellcraft 43(50), Taunt 16(15), Tumble 20(21)<br/>\n<br/>\nSpells:<br/>\nEarly in his career, he discovered some old transmuter tomes. He read with great interest how Tenser\u2019s magic could transform himself into a longsword wielding fighter. He understood how this would support his sword master prowess even in transformed state! Ever after, he has used that spell to improve his fighter abilities whenever needed (always).<br/>\n<br/>\nSpells lvl 1 \u2013 5: Sword enhancing spells, buffs and utility spells<br/>\nSpells lvl 6: Tenser\u2019s and buffs<br/>\nSpells lvl 7: Extended Tenser\u2019s and buffs<br/>\nSpells lvl 8: Empowered Tenser\u2019s and buffs<br/>\nSpells lvl 9: Maximized Tenser\u2019s and support spells<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Beware!\u00a0</strong><br/>\nIf you ever become harassed by this heavily buffed Doom knight/ sword master, performing Whirlwind attacks flanked by a Red Dragon and a Fairy Dragon, you know who that b*st*rd is!<br/>\nUnbuffed and with a mundane longsword he has only AC 18, AB +27/+22/+17, damage 1-8 (crit: 15-20/x3), 362 HP and fort, refl and will saves all +20.<br/>\nHowever, with maximized Tenser\u2019s and buffs, it can reach (approximately) AC50, AB +53/+48/+43, damage 1-8 +8 (15-20/x3) +1d6 fire +3physical and have more than 600 HP.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/202004/10235235_5856500d0a5a26a96865dd50bccc6155_t.jpg\"/><br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/202004/10235235_d158e676808c36d51a7d54e809f5ff49_t.jpg\"/><img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/202004/10235235_477e904879960f49f0638baa9249da73_t.jpg\"/></div>",
