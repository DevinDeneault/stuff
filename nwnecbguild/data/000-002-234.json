I suppose extend for a buffer and max for a slinger but am I off in thinking this? <br/>\n<br/>\n Thoughts , opinions? Maybe personal \"rank\" of importance in a build.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">My personal favorites for a Druid of any kind are Extend Spell and Empower Spell, now if you have more room i would put Maximize Spell there too, but never Quicken Spell. Extend Spell can be used with many Druid Spells like Aura of Vitality, Stonehold and others, while Empower Spell is for stat buffs and Firestorm, Ice Storm, Flame Strike and empowered Call Lightning to name a few.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Agree with Val. I would never even add MAX spell. It's a waste of a feat because any spell that you could max 3 levels higher there is a better spell in the Druid spellbook. Extend and Empower, bro. That's your bread and butter :D<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
