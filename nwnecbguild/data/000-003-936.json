      "content": "<div>Hi I've been trying to come up with an optimized level 40 build for a Dwarf battle/war cleric.\u00a0 You'd think there'd be a ton of options however I can't find one that suits my needs.\u00a0 They're mostly just taking a few (upto 15) cleric levels to get some self buffing then focussing on being melee.\u00a0 I'd like one that has respectable divine spell casting, so mainly cleric levels with melee to support.\u00a0 Other than cleric I don't care too much which classes get mixed in however I don't want RDD for this character and he must be good or neutral alignment so sadly BG is out (although a good option for this build). I also want to use warhammers so not a flurry of blows kama build.<br/>\nThis character will be levelled normally.\u00a0 Being mainly cleric this shouldn't present a problem however it does mean I need to try and avoid the 20% xp penalty which unfortunately means cleric/paladin isn't an option really although it would fit well.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) PvM or PvP - PvM mainly although PvP is enabled on the server so should be a consideration. Definitely not a duelling build however.<br/>\n2) Level cap - 40<br/>\n3) Race preference - Must be a Dwarf.<br/>\n4) Class preference - As above, Cleric main + whatever.\u00a0 Archetype: Dwarven Holy Warrior, Champion of Moradin/Clangeddin, War Priest.<br/>\n5) Melee preference - 1h and shield, warhammer, heavy plate.<br/>\n6) Range preference - Maybe a crossbow just for the utility, I don't want to waste feats investing in ranged though. I guess zen archery would be a great 1 feat investment for this guy tho so maybe.<br/>\n7) Weapon preference - Warhammer<br/>\n8) Maximum item enhancement - I'm not sure on the max but relatively low to medium magic so GMW, darkfire etc very useful. <br/>\n9) Spellcasting - As much cleric as I can fit in without gimping the melee side.\u00a0 Mainly melee fighting with spells to buff, provide utility and as a supplementary offence. If possible I'd like to fit in a SF and GSF, and one arcane defence. However they're not game breaking.\u00a0 <br/>\n10) Custom factors - I can adapt if there are.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks guys!</div>"

Dwarfs favour fighters a lot, so 4-6 levels will give you a good boost in your damage and you can round-up the build with 10 levels of CoT without occurring an exp penalty at all. Then, ESF in evocation can be fit inside the build without a problem and although you won't have the best DC's for your spells (due to focus in strength) at least they can be decent that way. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't have the time for a full build right now, but I will give you the fundamentals of the build and you tell me if you like it. <br/>\n<br/>\nStr16(<strong>28</strong>) Dex(8) Con(16) Int(14) Wis15(<strong>20</strong>) Cha(6) makes a nice starting point for a Cleric(26)/ Fighter(4)/ Champion of Torm(10) <br/>\nThe build is Cleric(12)/ Fighter(4)/ Champion of Torm(4) (pre-epic)\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapon focus, Improved Critical, Weapon Specialization, Blind-Fight, Knockdown, Improved Knockdown, Spell Focus, Greater Spell Focus, Extend Spell, Empower Spell, Maximize Spell, Toughness (pre-epic) <br/>\nEpic Weapon Focus, Epic Weapon Specialization, Epic Prowess, Armour Skin, Epic Spell Focus, Great Strength V, Great Wisdom II (epic) <br/>\n<br/>\nYour AB should be +40/ +35/ +30/ +25 with 4 attacks/round &amp; <br/>\nYour DMG should be 1d8+15/ 19-20x3 with a stock warhammer <br/>\n<br/>\nPretty respectable figures I would say, even before you think about buffing yourself...</div>"

I don't think you really have enough skill points to cover everything to make the rogue splash worth while. Also as a cleric I'm not sure UMD is quite as important as it is for other classes.\u00a0 Monk would be much better if it was a robe/kama build though and that's not what I want to go for with this guy.</div>"

Especially when you start with little or no gear.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can't cast 9th level spells naturally until level 36 which isn't good.\u00a0\u00a0 You're stuck at late levels with 2 Great Wis feats that you basically have to take though (only other options are epic spells).<br/>\n<br/>\nI had to front load the metamagic feats when arguably that's where they're less useful.\u00a0 <br/>\n<br/>\nOne area where this can be improved, I'm taking Spell focus abjuration line because on the server I'm playing it helps with dispelling (likewise arcan defence abj gives +2 to beat dispel) so might be worth working in? <br/>\n<br/>\n\"<em>Dispel Magic: Spell Focus: Abjuration now adds +2 to dispel checks and Greater Spell Focus: Abjuration adds +4. If the target has Arcane Defense (Abjuration), dispel checks are lowered by 2\"</em><br/>\n<em>\"Greater Spell Breach: \u00a0Breaches 1 more effect with Greater Spell Focus: Abjuration. If the target has Arcane Defense (Abjuration), it will breach one buff less\"</em><br/>\n<br/>\nI can see the logic in ditching those feats entirely maybe if this guys caster level is considered decent enough to do without those.\u00a0 That would open up 2/3 more feats. I think for a regular server I would ditch the spell focus feats entirely though. \u00a0 Expertise is taken at lvl 39 because honestly there's nothing really better to take there but it's a bit late to be really useful.\u00a0\u00a0 I couldn't get Epic Spell focus in, presumably because my level order is messed up.\u00a0 I'm guessing Expertise should be ESF.\u00a0 I'm not sure on whether to keep spell focus in, if there's something really good I'm giving up maybe I'd drop it.\u00a0 Would like to hear opinions on it.\u00a0 I don't see the point in working in divine stuff with 6 charisma.\u00a0 Dev Crit is probably not that useful for this build, the str is a bit low and warhammer is a poor choice for dev crit.\u00a0 It would require changing (scimitar) the theme of the build a bit too much I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nI look forward to you tearing this all apart!!</div>"

I like your fixed version feuderali, it should do well in any module/PW. Your levelling/feat order could be improved somewhat but even like that it is fine. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor playability's sake, for example, I would take the two increases in strength first and then follow with the three wisdom increases (pre-epic). I would put \"toughness\" at 18th level and get the combat feats first and I would start with Fighter instead of Cleric so I can start with 5AB instead of 3AB. In epic levels I would take that 23rd Cleric level first, then start with CoT for example so I could get armour skin earlier and a CL increase or I would stop it at 20 then take all CoT levels asap to get my epic combat feats earlier and then continue with Cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis stuff is nitpicking though and I feel you have done a good job overall with this build, you only need a good hammer (of thunderbolts) now and you are ready to go!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Thanks Val, I will try to incorporate your suggestions and revise it.\u00a0 I'm getting 62AB self buffed (69 with Str and War domains).<br/>\n\u00a0 <br/>\nI really feel like starting as cleric is easier though.\u00a0 In my experience you usually start out with no money, no decent gear and no potions.\u00a0 As a fighter this means level 1 your're clenching your butt fighting every goblin hoping they don't get a lucky crit and send you back to character creation.\u00a0 With a cleric you can send the badger of doom in and if he dies, summon another and then run for it so you can rest and try again.\u00a0 I definitely think cleric is easier for getting over the starting hump, however that does depend on your server conditions I suppose.\u00a0 I usually go for hardcore games and permadeath.\u00a0 If you can start with some potions then fighter would be fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also considering dropping maximise spell as I don't find I'm using it.\u00a0 What would you replace it with?\u00a0 I think expertise is an obvious alternative, although zen archery would be good if you have limited rest restrictions in your game.\u00a0 Early game you can send the summon in and snipe from a safe distance.\u00a0 Once you get the tyrantfog zombie this could work pretty well.\u00a0 So you could take Zen archery early and push the spell focus feats back a bit since early on they're not that useful.</div>"

      "content": "<div>If you are referring to permadeath worlds and so on then you are probably right feuderali, but even on WoG (which is a hard PW), you can start with a bunch of healing potions which is why I figured a strong starting AB was preferable. <br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the final maximum AB this is always calculated as (Base AB +20 AB max from various bonuses +6 AB from max strength) and then there are the de-buffs (curse song, prayer, taunt etc) and the \"feats\" which is mainly the \"smite\" ability. If you see anything else on your character sheet then ignore it, it isn't very accurate, the combat log is much better. The character sheet also does not take into account stuff like size modifiers (Dragonshape AB, AC) and so on. <br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, the feat choice is entirely up to you and all you have said would be a good choice, however, I have seen some very good results by using \"scribe scroll\" or \"craft wand\". It is very handy to have 100 Heal scrolls ready in your scroll case, or a wand with 50 charges of Darkfire ready to use and since I see that you want to have as much magical power as possible, then I feel one of these feats would be a good alternative to (Zen archery, Expertise).</div>"
