Which does, of course, make sense. However, it got me thinking (always dangerous for us infantry types) about the lack of Gnome builds - in both Hip's ECB Filter and the Archive, gnome is the least represented race by a country mile. Why is that, do we think?<br/>\n<br/>\n Admittedly, there's a clear role preference given for gnomes at creation, but the same is true of most other races. Is it simply less adaptable than the others, regardless of their own restrictions/penalties? Or is there something particular about the big-noses we struggle with?<br/>\n<br/>\n Yours, hoping for clarity, Stag<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Absolutely get what you say about gnome-lore - any Scandinavians out there who might like to help?<br/>\n<br/>\n You know I haven't done caster stuff at all (I don't count Bard song) - it's all too complicated for a bear with very little brain - so Gnome was never likely to be my first choice of race. But you have me thinking again. From a selfish perspective, I wonder if a Gnome Wiz/Monk/Rogue might be a runner - using Monk more for defensive purposes (more balanced saves, naturally improving speed and AC, various immunities and so on) than I have before. I appreciate there will be a trade-off in terms of number of levels taken, but it might be a good way for me to start experimenting with this magic malarkey as well. (Although I can't help but love the idea of a Gnome berserker.)<br/>\n<br/>\n And I'll get more turnips, too!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

In fact, it would severely cramp both Monk and Rogue by not allowing either to reach the minimum of what I'd like (although I suppose M6/Rog10 might just about work, just with xp penalties). Five levels in HS would actually allow for up to 11 in Rog (I'll simply take your word that at least 24 levels of caster should be taken as a given, 'cos you've been right on lots of other things), although I do see what you say about spell pen -<br/>\n<br/>\n Hold on, I meant this to be theoretical - as far as I was concerned, anyway!

I'd do it differently, but I'm no great shakes at WM builds, so not better, just differently. Mick's Rotor is, as ever, fascinating. And I'm enjoying looking at the ongoing discussion in the Unfinalized forum too - and learning stuff as well, so many thanks, one and all.<br/>\n<br/>\n In a way, I'm now seeing gnomes more as idiot savants - gifted, but obsessed with the minor details (Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man, effectively). Which of course reinforces Hip's original Wiz/Rog thinking. And yet also with the potential for immense crossness and raging. All good stuff. As hunearo hints at, it seems like an excellent RP choice, but perhaps not the best for power builds, except in very particular ways.<br/>\n<br/>\n Alas, before I turn my sagging intellect to trying to come up with a caster-gnome, I have unfinished business with two or three builds I need to finalize, so I'll be getting on with testing them first. And then you can start laughing about one that emanates for here. Thank you all.<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and as far as Half-Elves are concerned, apologies: I'd forgotten to even search for them (which says something in itself), so thanks for picking me up on that, hunearo - and big plusses for using the filter, too!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Also, as a cost for diverting points to CON for EDR, with only 26 STR, your Dev Crit DC will be lower than if you went for pure STR.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take this build I made in 2012 and substitute Gnome
