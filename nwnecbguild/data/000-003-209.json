      "content": "<div>Hello Everyone - hope all are well!<br/>\n<br/>\n Sorry I've been awol for a while - doing that Elder Scrolls malarkey. Now need a Neverwinter fix, so am being lazy and asking for a build. Those who've met me know that I have issues with Rangers (except Mick's Minsc, obvs) wearing heavy armour - ditto with Baabars\u00a0 (I know, I know, but you shouldn't have had a 'build request' site if you didn't want awkward asses like me making use of them!). So, please could you give me a Barbarian who's strong and agile (hence the HS element), at least fond of people (so no evils), and blindingly good with either both hands or with one big sod-off weapon, and feels comfortable without wearing the entire metal production of the Cloakwood Mines. Race is pretty much immaterial, except that gnome would seem a little odd.<br/>\n<br/>\n I seem to recall a glorious green wench that Val created not so long ago who might fit the bill, but she seems to have gone walkabout. Anyway, I'll drop this into the mix.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks in advance, one and all.<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and no offence meant to Max's Barb/CoT build, which I think is just lovely!</div>",

      "content": "<div>Hi. I've changed my mind a little about this one, but still any advice and guidance would be welcome. I'm now looking for a Barbarian, Ranger, Shadowdancer, and thinking at least 21 levels of Barb for Terrifying Rage, at least 9 levels of Ranger (assuming\u00a0 a dual-wielder, although, as I said before, I'd be quite happy with a 2-handed jobby, or even a double weapon), and 4 or 5 levels of SD. Again, I'm not wanting to be wearing too much tin, but would be okay with medium armour if not dual-wielding.<br/>\n<br/>\n Any thoughts?....Anyone?<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers, all</div>",

      "content": "<div>Many thanks, DatCat - and greetings!<br/>\n<br/>\n This takes me in a different direction from where I was thinking - and is none the worse for that! I'd been trying to squeeze Bane and Terrifying Rage together (and not entirely surprisingly, failing), and using Shadowdancer primarily for HiPS, Tumble and Shadow Evade - Epic Dodge never even crossed my mind. Equally, nor did making a Dex build - rather simplistically, having recognised I'd be getting hit, I was looking to boost Str and Con (to minimise foes' chances of said hitting by killing them quick, and failing that, being able to soak up damage before things got ugly). Hmmm. Much to think about, have I.<br/>\n<br/>\n As to my server, much to my chagrin, I've yet to join a PW, so am simply chucking in the disc and playing. I have been taken to task many times about the paucity of the OC and its official follow-ups, and that all makes sense - I just haven't got round to it yet (I only started playing in November, following a healthy Baldur's Gate obsession. Late developer all round.)<br/>\n<br/>\n Things seem a little quiet on the Guild at the moment, but everyone I've encountered here has been educative, entertaining and very supportive of a newbie (and they can all pay me later) since I stumbled upon it last December.<br/>\n<br/>\n Many thanks again - I'll let you know the final result.</div>",
