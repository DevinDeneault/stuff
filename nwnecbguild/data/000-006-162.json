      "content": "<div>Hail, ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\n This is the last of my Henchmen Rebuilds. I have heard only recently that you can also play Mischa Waymeet with a certain Vault file, but I have never played with her myself, nor will I go back to playing SoU just to play her. So if anyone wants to post her remake, please do so. As for me, I finish with the cutest little destruction machine called Deekin. Since there is no Kobold race in NWN, I made him a Gnome, but you can use the sub-race to kind of correct that (although he will still receive penalty to STR and increase to CON). He begins his life as a little Bard thingy who is afraid to engage in melee combat, so he will start by learning to use his cute little crossbow and stay out of harm's way. Then as he discovers he has Dragon Blood in his veins, he becomes increasingly more powerful and confident, switching to a melee weapon, a shortsword, and dealing heavy punishment to his foes. He should have more Bard upfront, but this is a Powerbuild for him, so I try to imagine that the build should suit his story before and after he happened to participate in the campaigns, so that it can be more about his personality than anything else. From then on it's a very straightforward and solid Bard / RDD build who gets Lasting Inspiration to symbolize his striving for Kobolds to become less evil and more social creatures.<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, Deekin Scalesinger!<br/>\n<br/>\n Bard(20), Fighter(10), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Gnome<br/>\n<br/>\n Alignment: Any non-lawful<br/>\n<br/>\n Playability: 1-40 PvM<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 14 (34)<br/>\n DEX: 10<br/>\n CON: 16 (18)<br/>\n WIS: 8<br/>\n INT: 14 (16)<br/>\n CHA: 14 (16)<br/>\n<br/>\n Gnome: (Defensive Training vs. Giants, Hardiness vs. Enchantments, Low-light Vision, Offensive Training vs. Goblinoids, Offensive Training vs. Reptilians, Skill Affinity: Concentration, Skill Affinity: Listen, Small Stature, Spell Focus: Illusion)<br/>\n 01: Bard(1): Power Attack<br/>\n 02: Fighter(1): Cleave<br/>\n 03: Fighter(2): Blind Fight, Weapon Focus: Light Crossbow<br/>\n 04: Fighter(3): STR+1, (STR=15)<br/>\n 05: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Light Crossbow<br/>\n 06: Bard(2): Called Shot<br/>\n 07: Red Dragon Disciple(1)<br/>\n 08: Red Dragon Disciple(2): STR+1, (STR=18)<br/>\n 09: Red Dragon Disciple(3): Rapid Reload<br/>\n 10: Red Dragon Disciple(4): (STR=20)<br/>\n 11: Red Dragon Disciple(5)<br/>\n 12: Bard(3): STR+1, Extend Spell, (STR=21)<br/>\n 13: Red Dragon Disciple(6)<br/>\n 14: Red Dragon Disciple(7): (CON=18)<br/>\n 15: Red Dragon Disciple(8): Point Blank Shot<br/>\n 16: Fighter(5): STR+1, (STR=22)<br/>\n 17: Fighter(6): Weapon Focus: Shortsword<br/>\n 18: Bard(4): Curse Song<br/>\n 19: Fighter(7)<br/>\n 20: Fighter(8): STR+1, Weapon Specialization: Shortsword, (STR=23)<br/>\n 21: Red Dragon Disciple(9): Armor Skin, (INT=16)<br/>\n 22: Red Dragon Disciple(10): {Darkvision}, (STR=27), (CHA=16)<br/>\n 23: Fighter(9)<br/>\n 24: Bard(5): STR+1, Expertise, (STR=28)<br/>\n 25: Bard(6)<br/>\n 26: Bard(7)<br/>\n 27: Bard(8): Epic Weapon Focus: Shortsword<br/>\n 28: Bard(9): STR+1, (STR=29)<br/>\n 29: Bard(10)<br/>\n 30: Bard(11): Great Strength I, (STR=30)<br/>\n 31: Bard(12)<br/>\n 32: Bard(13): STR+1, (STR=31)<br/>\n 33: Bard(14): Great Strength II, (STR=32)<br/>\n 34: Bard(15)<br/>\n 35: Bard(16)<br/>\n 36: Bard(17): STR+1, Epic Prowess, (STR=33)<br/>\n 37: Bard(18)<br/>\n 38: Bard(19)<br/>\n 39: Bard(20): Lasting Inspiration<br/>\n 40: Fighter(10): STR+1, Epic Weapon Specialization: Shortsword, (STR=34)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 464<br/>\n Skillpoints: 237<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 27/21/18<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +6, Mind Effects: +2<br/>\n BAB: 27<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 44 (melee), 30 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 25/35<br/>\n Spell Casting: Bard(6)<br/>\n Alignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\n Discipline 43(55), Lore 10(33), Perform 42(45), Spellcraft 28(31), Taunt 42(45), Tumble 40(40), UMD 32(35)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Discipline(2), Lore(4), Perform(4), Taunt(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(2),<br/>\n 02: Lore(1), Save(5),<br/>\n 03: Lore(1), Save(8),<br/>\n 04: Lore(1), Save(11),<br/>\n 05: Lore(1), Save(14),<br/>\n 06: Perform(5), Taunt(5), Tumble(5), UMD(5),<br/>\n 07: Discipline(2), Save(2),<br/>\n 08: Save(6),<br/>\n 09: Save(10),<br/>\n 10: Save(14),<br/>\n 11: Save(18),<br/>\n 12: Perform(6), Taunt(6), Tumble(6), UMD(6),<br/>\n 13: Discipline(2), Save(2),<br/>\n 14: Save(6),<br/>\n 15: Save(10),<br/>\n 16: Save(14),<br/>\n 17: Save(18),<br/>\n 18: Perform(6), Taunt(6), Tumble(6), UMD(6),<br/>\n 19: Discipline(3), Save(1),<br/>\n 20: Discipline(2), Save(3),<br/>\n 21: Save(7),<br/>\n 22: Save(12),<br/>\n 23: Save(17),<br/>\n 24: Perform(6), Taunt(6), Tumble(6), UMD(6),<br/>\n 25: Discipline(3), Perform(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),<br/>\n 26: Discipline(3), Perform(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),<br/>\n 27: Discipline(3), Perform(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),<br/>\n 28: Discipline(3), Perform(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),<br/>\n 29: Discipline(3), Perform(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),<br/>\n 30: Discipline(3), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1),<br/>\n 31: Discipline(3), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1),<br/>\n 32: Discipline(3), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1),<br/>\n 33: Discipline(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(3), Taunt(1), Tumble(1),<br/>\n 34: Discipline(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(3), Taunt(1), Tumble(1),<br/>\n 35: Discipline(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(3), Taunt(1), Tumble(1),<br/>\n 36: Discipline(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(3), Taunt(1), Tumble(1),<br/>\n 37: Perform(1), Spellcraft(3), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), Save(1),<br/>\n 38: Perform(1), Spellcraft(4), Taunt(1), Save(2),<br/>\n 39: Lore(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(6), Taunt(1),<br/>\n 40: Discipline(4), Lore(1),<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div>"

I imagined him this way: at first he was a little scared Kobold with low self-confidence so he wouldn't engage in melee for that reason. However, as the dragon blood in him grew stronger, he became more confident and even more likely to engage in a melee confrontation, then he starts investing in Taunts and Bard Song to support his already strong Melee presence. I always take AS before EWF because on WoG, AC is more important than AB, but you can swap them if it suits you better.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the feedback, if it wasn't for the fact I am trying to make theme builds, I definitely wouldn't have bothered with the X-bow feats, especially with such a low DEX. Again, powerbuilding-wise these are a waste, so you can get rid of: WF and WS Light X-bow, Rapid Reload and Point Blank Shot, and Called Shot as well, so there is plenty of room for improvement here <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

      "content": "<div>I've been thinking about Deekin a bit of late - as the best henchie in any of the official campaigns. Then I remembered that Max had built him already - hooray! And I like the Gnome for quirkiness - I'd been thinking Hin. Either gets an xp penalty, but worth it imo. You could get round it by going CoT instead of Fighter, but the RP balance might get out of whack. Plus you'd lose E/WS and another BF.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheoretically, if you drop the X-bow and related feats, there's room for Imp Crit and Great Cleave, as well as maybe Still Spell, KD and IKD. And you could actually end up with a Dev Critting Deekin! You'd have to sacrifice 2 Great Strengths for Ow and Dev Crit, but it's tempting ain't it?<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to bump from way back, but this could really be fun (be nice if we could get his voice, though)!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",
