I ask primarily because if you're just wanting it for buffs, you might do better looking at something else - maybe Cleric, Bard (for the song, if nothing else), or even Rogue (for UMD). A couple of those will also give you Tumble.<br/>\n<br/>\n Secondly, do you want this to be primarily a meleer or a type of spellsword?<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh - I don't know if you've had a look around on the Pre-Epic sub-forum here, but right at the top of the list there is a Fighter 6 / Blackguard 10 / Rogue 4 that might be close to what you want. Check it out and see what you think.<br/>\n<br/>\n Again, good to have you on board! <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The second option is a bard. A third option is the melee mage; a wizard 20. Another idea is to play a Druid, but there the melee focus often is on the shapes.<br/>\n Multiclassing on your server forces your build down to 15 caster levels, or 13 if you want 3 classes.<br/>\n Cleric15/X5 and Bard15/X5 are viable, but IMO pure builds will be better.(Perhaps not for Bard).<br/>\n If you reverse the question, and primarily want a meleer, then Bard may serve well as a minor class to offer tumble UMD, taunt and a song to boost the melee prowess. It may also open up for RDD.<br/>\n But in that case other \"tumble classes\" are also available.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Without empowered abilities, the potential of this build is nerfed.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of ImpInvis, take Shadow Conjuration to get access to Darkness.\u00a0 Every hit within Darkness cloud will cause sneak damage (@BG 10 that's +3-18 slash).\u00a0 You get ImpInvis for free from possessing the Faerie Dragon at Src 1 and then later at Src 5 with the pixie.\u00a0 Whether you dismiss the familiar after the buffing or not for XP penalty reasons is up to you.\u00a0 Other options are ILMS, Ice Storm, Element shield, Stoneskin... whatever.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you send your BG summon into a pack of corporeal (living) creatures, NEB spam on your undead summon is easily the most powerful spell in your repertoire.\u00a0 Keen Edge will be sacrificed, but such is the natural consequence of low-level sorc... repertoire is always severely restrictive.\u00a0 A wider crit range only factors into combat against lower AC types and does nothing vs. the toughest threats where the AC is near the top of the AB range or dependent on naturals to hit at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the basic problem in this concept is that you are not using the src strengths... the offensive spells.\u00a0 Src (or wiz, for that matter) is not much of a self-buffer except for the True Strikes.\u00a0 Cleric would be far superior.\u00a0 You'd invest less in STR (because div buffs will more than compensate from the lost AB and dmg), more in WIS and CHA and not be haunted by spell failure.\u00a0\u00a0 But you have lots of company.\u00a0 This isn't the first request for a concept that is impossible to optimize adequately.\u00a0 You can pretty much depend on losing all PvP encounters except against the clueless inhabiting ther server.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
