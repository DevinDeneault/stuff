I'm not sure what you need, but I can think of 2 options:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Str primary + Dex skills, or basically a sneaky str damage dealer with lots of bard buffs<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Dex primary and use the +8 Str from RDD as just bonus damage. I assume you want SD at 10 because you like epic dodge.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I've played 20bard/10 rdd/ 10Sd based on strenght, I wanna try this one now but on dex but I don't know how to build it correctly.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I would go rapier+shield and simply key your shield on your toolbar to unequip it before casting. Only issue I have with this one is you have to choose what gets left until the end, here I chose to leave epic dodge off until last so I could get one final tumble / hide / move silently dump.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said I also have a Bard 20 SD 10 CoT 10 that I built for you which is a dual wielding roguish fighter. Same concept but way more feats to play with and you get Lasting Inspiration from level 20 Bard. Where are you planning to play this character? If you want me to post it I will but it's not the class split you originally said.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Edit: I shot for Bard level 4 spells for Imp Invis ASAP, then shot for bard 16 for max song soon after. It is perfectly fine to change up the leveling order but keep in mind the rule of 4s.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
