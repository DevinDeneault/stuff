Preferably with no more than 2 classes in it. By viable I don't mean super characters like Scythe WM hitting 300s~ etc. But as epic summoner PC as possible.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">While I am not posting one of my builds here on this subject, yet, I do have a suggestion.  Wizzys are good, but a better summoner for solo or party play would be a cleric with the animal domain.  This would give you one step up in your summons.  The best summoning build that I can think of is Grizzled Dwarflords, <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build245245.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Fighting Ariel of Elohanna</a>  As long as you have the ability to choose the animal domain and the plant domain, this build will rock.  Will try to come up with an original (at least one of my own, original is a misnomer since most things have been done before) at some point.<br/>\n<br/>\nDev<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
