      "content": "<div>Hey all! This idea came about when I was trying to create a new character for my RP server, which should automatically tell you he's not a powergame-type character--though by all means, not weak. This guy can do almost anything: open locks, disable traps, scout, heal, buff, cast, melee...he's very much a \"jack of all trades, master of none\", and will do well either in\u00a0a party or on his own.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks to Mick and Empyre for their help!<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>\"A smirk curled around your lips as you turned out the contents of the safe into your bag. Really, it was too easy--pick out a mark, pose as a cleric of some goody-two-shoes deity,\u00a0go to their door offering to bless their household, take note of the layout and loot once inside, and return at night to\u00a0steal it all. Let fools and do-gooders rush toward poverty and death; you'd be more than happy to profit at their expense.\u00a0A particularly beautiful sapphire caught your eye, and you set it aside to later be offered as tribute to the Lord of Shadows. Satisfied with your gain, you rose to your feet, hoisted your bags over your shoulders, and walked right past the guards,\u00a0out into the night.\"</em><br/>\n<br/>\n ~~Demarch of Mask~~<br/>\n Cleric(24), Rogue(16), Human<br/>\n<br/>\n Alignment:<span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong> Any (</strong></span>Neutral Evil<span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>, recommended)</strong></span><br/>\n<br/>\n Playability: PvE<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 10<br/>\n DEX: 16 (26)<br/>\n CON: 12<br/>\n WIS: 15 (19)<br/>\n INT: 14<br/>\n CHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n Human: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n 01: Rogue(1): Two-Weapon Fighting, Ambidexterity<br/>\n 02: Cleric(1): Domain Trickery, Domain\u00a0Evil<br/>\n 03: Cleric(2): Weapon Finesse<br/>\n 04: Cleric(3): WIS+1, (WIS=16)<br/>\n 05: Cleric(4)<br/>\n 06: Cleric(5): Weapon Focus: Shortsword<br/>\n 07: Rogue(2): {Evasion}<br/>\n 08: Cleric(6): WIS+1, (WIS=17)<br/>\n 09: Cleric(7): Extend Spell<br/>\n 10: Cleric(8)<br/>\n 11: Cleric(9)<br/>\n 12: Rogue(3): WIS+1, Knockdown, {Uncanny Dodge I}, (WIS=18)<br/>\n 13: Cleric(10)<br/>\n 14: Cleric(11)<br/>\n 15: Cleric(12): Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br/>\n 16: Cleric(13): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br/>\n 17: Rogue(4)<br/>\n 18: Cleric(14): Blind Fight<br/>\n 19: Cleric(15)<br/>\n 20: Cleric(16): DEX+1, (DEX=17)<br/>\n 21: Cleric(17): Epic Weapon Focus: Shortsword<br/>\n 22: Rogue(5)<br/>\n 23: Cleric(18)<br/>\n 24: Cleric(19): DEX+1, Great Dexterity I, (DEX=19)<br/>\n 25: Cleric(20)<br/>\n 26: Cleric(21)<br/>\n 27: Rogue(6): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=20)<br/>\n 28: Cleric(22): DEX+1, (DEX=21)<br/>\n 29: Cleric(23): Armor Skin<br/>\n 30: Rogue(7): Great Dexterity III, (DEX=22)<br/>\n 31: Rogue(8)<br/>\n 32: Rogue(9): DEX+1, (DEX=23)<br/>\n 33: Rogue(10): Great Dexterity IV, Improved Evasion, (DEX=24)<br/>\n 34: Rogue(11)<br/>\n 35: Rogue(12)<br/>\n 36: Rogue(13): DEX+1, Epic Dodge, Defensive Roll, (DEX=25)<br/>\n 37: Rogue(14)<br/>\n 38: Rogue(15)<br/>\n 39: Rogue(16): Epic Prowess, Crippling Strike<br/>\n 40: Cleric(24): DEX+1, (DEX=26)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 328<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 22/25/27<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9, Traps: +3<br/>\n<br/>\n BAB: 25 AB (max, naked): 37 (melee), 34 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 28/32<br/>\n<br/>\n Spell Casting: Cleric(9)<br/>\n<br/>\n Skillpoints: 329<br/>\n Bluff 35 (34), Disable Trap 21(25)<span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>[21(23)]</strong></span>, Hide 42(50), Move Silently 42(50), Open Lock 1(9), Search 27(29), Spellcraft 43(45), Spot 42(46), Tumble 40(48), UMD 36(35)<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>Skill Schedule</strong><br/>\n 01: Bluff(2), Disable Trap(4), Hide(4), Move Silently(4), Open Lock(1), Search(2), Spot(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(15),<br/>\n 02: Spellcraft(5), Save(15),<br/>\n 03: Spellcraft(1), Save(19),<br/>\n 04: Spellcraft(1), Save(23),<br/>\n 05: Spellcraft(1), Save(27),<br/>\n 06: Spellcraft(1), Save(31),<br/>\n 07: Bluff(5), Disable Trap(1), Hide(6), Move Silently(6), Search(6), Spot(6), Tumble(6), UMD(6),<br/>\n 08: Spellcraft(2), Save(3),<br/>\n 09: Spellcraft(1), Save(7),<br/>\n 10: Spellcraft(1), Save(11),<br/>\n 11: Spellcraft(1), Save(15),<br/>\n 12: Bluff(1), Hide(5), Move Silently(5), Spot(5), Tumble(5), UMD(5),<br/>\n 13: Spellcraft(2), Save(3),<br/>\n 14: Spellcraft(1), Save(7),<br/>\n 15: Spellcraft(1), Save(11),<br/>\n 16: Spellcraft(1), Save(15),<br/>\n 17: Disable Trap(1), Hide(5), Move Silently(5), Spot(5), Tumble(5), UMD(5),<br/>\n 18: Spellcraft(2), Save(3),<br/>\n 19: Spellcraft(1), Save(7),<br/>\n 20: Spellcraft(1), Save(11),<br/>\n 21: Spellcraft(1), Save(15),<br/>\n 22: Bluff(1), Hide(5), Move Silently(5), Spot(5), Tumble(5), UMD(5),<br/>\n 23: Spellcraft(2), Save(3),<br/>\n 24: Spellcraft(1), Save(7),<br/>\n 25: Spellcraft(1), Save(11),<br/>\n 26: Spellcraft(1), Save(15),<br/>\n 27: Hide(5), Move Silently(5), Search(1), Spot(5), Tumble(5), UMD(5),<br/>\n 28: Spellcraft(2), Save(3),<br/>\n 29: Spellcraft(1), Save(7),<br/>\n 30: Bluff(5), Hide(3), Move Silently(3), Search(4), Spot(3),<br/>\n 31: Bluff(4), Disable Trap(2), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(2), Spot(1),<br/>\n 32: Bluff(1), Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(5),<br/>\n 33: Bluff(1), Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), UMD(6),<br/>\n 34: Bluff(3), Disable Trap(2), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(3), Spot(1),<br/>\n 35: Bluff(3), Disable Trap(5), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1),<br/>\n 36: Disable Trap(3), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(5), Spot(1),<br/>\n 37: Bluff(3), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(5),<br/>\n 38: Bluff(3), Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(3), Spot(1), Save(1),<br/>\n 39: Bluff(3), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Save(6),<br/>\n 40: Spellcraft(11),</span><br/>\n<br/>\n Notes:<br/>\n<br/>\n 1) You are, first and foremost, a self-reliant support character. You can do almost anything...except tank. Your HPs are low-ish for a melee character, buffs only go so far, and being the center of attention means you aren't utilizing your 8d6 sneak attacks. Keep to the edges of the fray, where you can summon, buff, cast offensive spells, or dip in and out for melee at your pleasure.<br/>\n<br/>\n 2) If you'd like more power, you can swap out\u00a0one level of Cleric and three of Rogue\u00a0for Fighter 4, earning you three bonus feats and access to EWS. The cost is dispellable buffs, 1d6 less Sneak Attack. no Crippling Strike, and a 20% XP bonus. I didn't do it because this is an RP-build first and foremost, and Fighter doesn't really fit,\u00a0but I still thought I should note the option.<br/>\n<br/>\n 3) Sneak-immune enemies are still your bane, but the Cleric's abilities make them easier to handle, especially undead. Your CHA isn't high enough to solidly rely on Turn Undead, but the buffs and divine spells help you out a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n 4) Sanctuary\u00a0and Greater Sanctuary are the ultimate scouting spells, as\u00a0they lets you waltz into a place, take note of the enemies, disable all traps, pick all locks, and waltz back out.<br/>\n<br/>\n 5) Your weapon doesn't have to be shortswords; any finessable weapon will do. If you want kukris, though,\u00a0you'll have to shuffle feats around and drop Knockdown for Exotic Weapon Proficiency.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><span style=\"color:#000000\">edit: per Hip 20161108 (corrections/additions of missing info, in</span></em><span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong> red</strong></span><em><span style=\"color:#000000\">)</span></em></div>"
