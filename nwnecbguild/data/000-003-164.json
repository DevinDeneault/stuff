      "content": "<div><blockquote><div><strong>KidMiracleman wrote:</strong><hr/>Is this one doable??</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">Well, yes... most any combo is \"doable\", David.\u00a0 But whether it can be optimized well enough to deserve further consideration or not by the guild community is another issue.\u00a0 Apparently, members here have not found it all that inspiring because, of the 200+ complete builds, there is not even one Barb/DwD posted. The guild tends to avoid illegal builds.\u00a0 As Kalistez has quickly pointed out, it is not a legit combo by default NWN rules, so would need some means of managing alignment either by a server-provided manager or some other way of toggling back and forth between Lawful and Non-lawful by scripted actions (which can be a royal time-wasting P-I-T-A, IMO).<br/>\n<br/>\n However, there are 3 I found that may interest you from the legacy archive:<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>BBN 26/DwD 14</strong> barbarian 26 / dwarven defender 14 (dwarf) by Tulians<br/>\n<strong>Terrifying Tank</strong> barbarian 16 / fighter 6 / dwarven defender 18 (dwarf) by Thaxll'ssyllia<br/>\n (No title) Barbarian 18 / Fighter 4 / DwD 18 barbarian 18 / fighter 4 / dwarven defender 18 (dwarf) by CrusaderOfGod451<br/>\n<br/>\n Without examining these in detail, I suspect Thax's to be the most reliable.\u00a0 You may want to check that one first. DwD 18 seems a popular breakpoint probably because they get 12/- DR and a bonus feat at that point.\u00a0 For TR, you need at least Barb 15 which leaves 7 levels left for the tertiary.\u00a0 In theory, you could go with some tertiary tumble class like rogue or monk for the boost to AC instead of fighter but will need to deal with a potential -20% XP penalty and the loss of bonus feats. \u00a0 Whether that matters much on your server or not, well... only YOU would know that.<br/>\n<br/>\n If you haven't installed the<em> ECB Legacy Archive Search</em> on your current box be sure to do so.<strong> <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2354480/How-and-Where-to-Access-Legacy-ECB-Archives\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Full instructions</a> </strong>have been published in our \"Rules and Tools\" subforum section. As long as you use a browser with Javascript enabled, it works exactly as it did on WoG's Comcast server before the plug was pulled.\u00a0 All I did was choose Barb and DwD for the 2 classes.\u00a0 You need to make sure to set the secondary class to at least 1 level (the default is always \"0\") or you will get every build that has the primary class added into list (which you don't need).<br/>\n<br/>\n After you've had an opportunity to review those builds, decide the Pros/Cons for your current situation and post your comments so we can help tweak it, if you would like.\u00a0 Or just use \"as is\" to get a quick start.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div></div>"
