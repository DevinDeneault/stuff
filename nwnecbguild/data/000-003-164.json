      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hi guys,<br/>\n<br/>\n I recently started reading these forums after rediscovering NWN, and I've had build fever ever since. When I was younger I mainly played fighter-heavy builds, that usually went Weapon Master and utilised Crit-stacking. Thus since I've come back I've been trying to avoid making any builds like this. I've been perusing (mainly) the level 40 builds, and I haven't yet come across a build that's quite like this, but I apologise anyway if I'm asking a question which has already been answered.<br/>\n<br/>\n The original design goal of this character was to be a Drow assassin which utilised the Darkness/Ultravision combo as a backup when assassination wasn't viable or had failed. I tried to stay away from using Rogue, because I figured that ultimately I would end up taking as few levels as possible in Assassin and pumping Rogue for the bonus feats, which goes against what I had originally intended on doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n 5 levels in Wizard gave me access to level 3 spells, which meant that I had access to Knock and Find Traps (which was important, because I intended on playing a Rogue-like SP module with this build and I wasn't going to be able to do anything until level 7 at the earliest without these spells), but it also allows me access to extended Darkness and Ultravision, as well as other handy level 2 buffs like Flame Weapon and Cat's Grace, etc. I ultimately decided on 5 levels because I felt like it was the most ideal breakpoint for what I wanted to achieve. There was nothing particularly appealing about level 4 spells, and beyond that I figured I would be better off making a Wizard rather than an Assassin.<br/>\n<br/>\n Originally I had planned on only taking a single level of Ranger as a Hide/Move Silently dump to meet the Assassin requirements, as well as taking advantage of the free dual wielding feats. Again, I was trying to stay away from Rogue, so I didn't have a whole lot of options. I considered Pale Master, as I would already qualify for the class and that would be pretty cool from a RP point of view, but ultimately decided against it as I'm not really sold on the usefulness of a Pale Master and what kind of level investment would be required, but that being said I'm not familiar with key CL breakpoints for Wizards. Anyway, I ended up deciding on 9 levels of ranger for (A) access to improved two weapon fighting, but more importantly (B) this pushed me to +16 BAB, allowing four attacks per round, plus two off-hand attacks, meaning that with haste I would breach the 7 attacks per round threshold, allowing triple opening death attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\n The remainder of the levels are simply dumped into Assassin, with no particular goals in mind as of yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n So my quesitons are:\u00a0<br/>\n 1. Is it worth taking any points in Wisdom? I'm not personally sold on the usefulness of Ranger spells, so I was planning on leaving my WIS at 8.\u00a0<br/>\n 2. Should I take more levels in Wizard? I'm kind of hesitant to do this because I'll be losing skill points in what already feels like a character with scacely enough skill points as it is.<br/>\n 3. How important are taking initiative feats? I've read that their real only use is for Assassin builds, but do I really want to spend four feats on these?\u00a0<br/>\n 4. By not taking any levels in Rogues I understand that I won't be able to discover epic traps. This isn't really too concerning because I don't know if this character will even make it to epic levels, as I don't play on any servers and don't really intend to. Should I be more concerned about this?<br/>\n 5. Any general recommendations? Anything important that I'm missing? Any tips of any kind?<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks guys<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">My two centavos...<br/>\n<br/>\n The only reason to take ranger is for the companion and low DEX requirement.\u00a0 I consider that strategy counter-productive.\u00a0 The WIS element confuses the issue even more since ranger class requires at least 11 at create if you want to hit the ground running AB-wise to qualify for AB 1 feats, an unnecessary restriction for a DW design and ability spread.\u00a0 All the wiz familiars are better than ranger companions because they can be possessed and some have extremely useful special abilities.\u00a0 Wiz gets high-level summons which puts all the ranger companions to shame.\u00a0 There aren't enough FEs at ranger 9 to compensate for the lost WS/EWS of fighter.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, if this is intended to be a stealth toon, DEX should be high.\u00a0 To trigger as many DAs (i.e. DC) as possible, INT should be high.\u00a0 So there is your synergy to balance.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n To cast arcane reliably without AutoStill (most likely beyond the scope of this combo), the toon will be wearing robes.\u00a0 That brings us back to DEX investment again as your primary ability and AC.\u00a0 And that also means Weapon Finesse a must.\u00a0 Let's assume martial proficiency if you use fighter.\u00a0 Then select dagger, handaxe, light hammer, mace, shortsword or sickle as weapon of choice.\u00a0 A DEX build is also a ranged attack build so you will be able to DA well even when switched to bow.<br/>\n<br/>\n Yes, UMD is there but mainly for equipment and divine buffs (if available).\u00a0 UMD buffs will all be short-lived and easily dispelled.<br/>\n<br/>\n Next, you will need at least Wiz 15 to max your weapon buffs and that means INT 18 to cast all spells that a level 15 Wiz has access to.\u00a0 That leaves 25 levels to split between assassin and fighter.<br/>\n<br/>\n To get Finesse, WF/EWF, WS/EWF requires at least 4 levels of fighter and possibly more depending on how often you want to dump to discipline.\u00a0 That means no more than 21 levels of assassin.\u00a0 But you probably want some access to special attacks like KD/IKD or Expertise, also ImpCrit so may need more fighter levels.\u00a0 I'd figure Fighter 6, at minimum. Now we are down to Asn 19.\u00a0 So you can stick with the Level 19 DA bump or stop at Asn 18 and boost Wiz to 16 for more slots and slightly better dispel resistance.\u00a0 Without alllocating, it is looking like Wiz 16/Ftr 6/Asn 18 at this point. Naturally, you can sacrifice wiz levels to gain more assassin prowess or fighter bonus but it will gimp your buffs (GMW, Flame Weapon, damage shields, etc.).\u00a0 I didn't run a BAB tally so the APR is still up for grabs at this split.<br/>\n<br/>\n Your wiz will want at least Empower to boost Cat (AC and AB) and Bull (dmg) and Extend for Darkness (a boon for all DAs), the 3 damage shields and mantles.<br/>\n<br/>\n The tricky part is in deciding race.\u00a0 Halfling would be the race of choice in this build but will limit your weapon alternatives and will likely cause an XP penalty.\u00a0 Elf will help with detection but at the cost of a feat and skills.\u00a0 Human 40 more skill points.\u00a0 Take your pick.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Intelligence also helps, but the share number of assassin levels is the main contributor.<br/>\n The second reason is that assassin has Great dexterity as epic bonus feat. Dedicated builds can have Great dex X and a total naked dex close to 40, and still have room for the essential epic combat feats.

Too bad the Darkness is so limited.\u00a0 But the issue still remains exactly the same as a high-level rogue... how do you dent undead, constructs, elementals, dragons, ooze, etc.?\u00a0 That's why a mitigator with damage shields and even offensive spellcasting power has merit.\u00a0 Weaker assassin but stronger PvM influence especially with the extended Darkness.<br/>\n<br/>\n But, yes, to commit to a dedicated all-or-nothing assassin, then definitely shoot for Asn 30 and screw the INT synergy.\u00a0 Maybe Ftr 8 and SD 2 to round it out, if HiPS doesn't cause bad dreams.

Traps are there for alternative damage, eg holy traps vs tough undead. Assassins can\u00a0also set epic traps.<br/>\n You can use mace as a blunt finessable weapon(s)\u00a0in case of\u00a0piercing resistance. You can buff the weapon with GMW, and Flame weapon scrolls. You can cast damage shields from scrolls.<br/>\n And if that doesn't satisfy, then you can use fighter for WS and EWS, and even build the assassin strength based for more reliable damage.<br/>\n On the other hand, for practical purposes, you do have 10-15 levels to spend as you please, for things like Ranger10/SD2, Rogue13/SD1 or some caster combo,\u00a0but don't expect much offensive spellcasting power.<br/>\n \u00a0</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
