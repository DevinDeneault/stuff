Valerfor's been messing with my head again (see his \"The Last Shinobi\" thread in the NwN Tavern sub-forum - though the rest of them could just be in hiding), so I thought I'd have a look at building a Monk/ Rogue/ Shadowdancer. This is very much first thoughts, so please feel free to do as you please with it (within the bounds of decency, of course). I went for unarmed rather than kama because the damage is so much better once you hit Monk 16 - that and the fact that I didn't exactly have feats to burn. And I sacrificed Epic Prowess to get those extra 2 Dex points, so it comes out the same as far as AB goes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Monk 26/ Rogue 13/ SD 1</strong><br/>\nHalfling, any lawful<br/>\nPvM 1-40<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Stats</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nSTR 10 <em>(gods, that hurts me to do)</em><br/>\nDEX 19 (34)<br/>\nCON 12<br/>\nWIS 12<br/>\nINT 13<br/>\nCHA 8<br/>\n<br/>\nHPs - 334<br/>\nAC - (naked) 31 (+1 Dodge, +5 Expertise)<br/>\nSaves - Fort 22, Will 22, Reflex 37. +2 vs mind spells, +2 vs fear-type spells, +4 vs spells, +2 vs traps <em>(or maybe more, I can't remember my UD stuff)</em>, immune to mind spells, immune to disease and poison<br/>\nEpic Dodge<br/>\nEmpty Body - 2xpd 50% concealment<br/>\nSpell Resistance - 36 (undispellable)<br/>\n7xd6 sneak attack<br/>\nBAB - 25<br/>\nAB - (max, unarmed) 41/ 38/ 35 <em>(7 APR with Monk progression and hasted - I think)</em>: (max, ranged) 38 (+1 with thrown weapons)<br/>\nDamage - (unarmed, melee) d20 (crit 19-20x2), penetrate DR 3/-<br/>\nSpells - UMD<br/>\nSPs - 281. <em>(Not fully worked out, but certainly including...)</em> Tumble 40 (52), UMD 34 (33), Spellcraft 19 (20), Hide 43, Move Silently 43, then some Listen, Dis Trap, Set Trap, Search and Open Lock <em>(need to do some more sums)</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Levelling</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n1 R1 - Dodge<br/>\n2 M1 - (Cleave/ Evasion/ FoB/ Stun Fist/ Imp Unarmed Strike)<br/>\n3 R2 - Weapon Finesse<br/>\n4 R3 - (Uncanny Dodge I)/ DEX+1 (20)<br/>\n5 M2 - (Deflect Arrows)<br/>\n6 M3 - (Monk Speed/ Still Mind)/ WF: Unarmed<br/>\n7 M4<br/>\n8 M5 - (Purity of Body)/ DEX+1 (21)<br/>\n9 M6 - (KD/ IKD)/ Expertise<br/>\n10 M7 - (Wholeness of Body)<br/>\n11 M8<br/>\n12 M9 - (Imp Evasion)/ Blind Fight/ DEX+1 (22)<br/>\n13 R4<br/>\n14 M10 - (Ki Strike 1)<br/>\n15 M11 - (Diamond Body)/ Imp Crit: Unarmed<br/>\n16 M12 - (Diamond Soul)/ DEX+1 (23)<br/>\n17 R5<br/>\n18 R6 - Mobility<br/>\n19 R7<br/>\n20 R8 - DEX+1 (24)<br/>\n21 SD1 - (HiPS)/ EWF: Unarmed<br/>\n22 R9<br/>\n23 R10 - Defensive Roll<br/>\n24 M13 - (Ki Strike 2)/ Great Dex I (25)/ DEX+1 (26)<br/>\n25 M14<br/>\n26 M15 - (Quivering Palm)<br/>\n27 M16 - (Ki Strike 3/ d20 fists)/ Epic Dodge<br/>\n28 M17 - DEX+1 (27)<br/>\n29 M18 - (Empty Body)<br/>\n30 M19 - Great Dex II (28)<br/>\n31 M20 - (Perfect Self)<br/>\n32 R11 - DEX+1 (29)<br/>\n33 R12 - Great Dex III (30)<br/>\n34 M21<br/>\n35 M22<br/>\n36 M23 - Great Dex IV (31)/ DEX+1 (32)<br/>\n37 R13 - Crippling Strike<br/>\n38 M24<br/>\n39 M25 - Great Dex V (33)/ Armor Skin<br/>\n40 M26 - DEX+1 (34)<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes it look reasonable as a principle?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It will cost 1AC and 1Reflex, but I know I'll feel more comfortable with a STR of 12 (particularly in light of what you said in the Last Shinobi thread about hin only attaining d12 fists). The extra skill points will also come in handy, as - for the first time - I want to make good use of the trapping skills as well as stealth.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll save doing the edit until I've worked out some more of the details - and in case anyone else has something to contribute.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks gkorjax - good catch on the AC. I do my builds in pencil and paper and forgot to add in the monk AC bumps. I'll change it in the edit.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, I didn't know about the non-availability of d20 fists (or age is conspiring against my memory again) for hins until Empyre pointed it out. Might mean some head-scratching on my part as far as race goes. That said, from the video Valerfor provides, it appears that ninja/shinobi foci are stealth and intelligence-gathering, but with the ability to defend oneself, and my intention with this one is to use stealth and traps (going wildly against my natural instincts, but one should keep learning, yes?) more than physical presence, so we'll see...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the feedback!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

CON would take a hit, but STR wouldn't, so things could balance out. There would, however, be an xp penalty...Arse.
