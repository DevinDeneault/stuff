referred to the build are the following ones:<br/>\n<br/>\n 1) Note that I have not relied on \"Devastating critical\", therefore I have not taken the involved feats. The idea is to have a defensive stalwart who is the \"Last man standing\" on the battlefield, and criticals are useless against constructs and undeads. Am I wrong?<br/>\n 2) I have taken 6 levels of CoT in order to obtain a reasonable Will saving throw; would it be preferable to take, instead, 6 levels of rogue (in order to maximize Tumble and raise UMD)? Or Paladin, in order to have fear immunity?<br/>\n 3) Is there a possibility to increase the levels of DwD, in order to raise better the Damage Reduction?<br/>\n<br/>\n Thank you for your caring!<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
