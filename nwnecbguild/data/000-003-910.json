      "content": "<div>Good afternoon all,<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my search for a guy who could have both sustain and damage. This guy came in with excellent scores across the board. His saves really set him apart, his AC on a +5 magic server is 69 and his AB is 45 with just DP. Combined with up to 10 attacks per round with darkfire and GMW you can lay on the hurt. He attains undispelability at the end and has invisibility to last until then. Just go invisible, walk next to your target, and unload. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can get improved knockdown earlier by dropping a level of cleric, saving monk 7 for a tumble dump.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like this guy, he's very solid, but he doesn't have anything super special. But this combo hasn't been done before and this guy can handle most every situation with ease. An excellent pick for solo play if you aren't playing Max's shadow priest. <br/>\n<br/>\nMonk(6), Cleric(24), Champion of Torm(10), Human<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nSTR: 8<br/>\nDEX: 16 (32)<br/>\nCON: 14<br/>\nWIS: 16 (20)<br/>\nINT: 12<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Cleric(1): Extend Spell, Blind Fight, Domain War, Domain Trickery<br/>\n02: Cleric(2)<br/>\n03: Monk(1): Weapon Finesse, {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}<br/>\n04: Cleric(3): DEX+1, (DEX=17)<br/>\n05: Cleric(4)<br/>\n06: Cleric(5): Weapon Focus: Kama<br/>\n07: Cleric(6)<br/>\n08: Cleric(7): DEX+1, (DEX=18)<br/>\n09: Cleric(8): Two-Weapon Fighting<br/>\n10: Cleric(9)<br/>\n11: Cleric(10)<br/>\n12: Cleric(11): DEX+1, Ambidexterity, (DEX=19)<br/>\n13: Cleric(12)<br/>\n14: Cleric(13)<br/>\n15: Monk(2): Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, {Deflect Arrows}<br/>\n16: Monk(3): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br/>\n17: Monk(4)<br/>\n18: Cleric(14): Improved Critical: Kama<br/>\n19: Cleric(15)<br/>\n20: Champion of Torm(1): DEX+1, (DEX=21)<br/>\n21: Champion of Torm(2): Epic Weapon Focus: Kama, Great Wisdom I, (WIS=17)<br/>\n22: Champion of Torm(3): {Smite Evil}<br/>\n23: Champion of Torm(4): Great Wisdom II, (WIS=18)<br/>\n24: Champion of Torm(5): DEX+1, Great Dexterity I, (DEX=23)<br/>\n25: Champion of Torm(6): Armor Skin<br/>\n26: Champion of Torm(7)<br/>\n27: Champion of Torm(8): Great Dexterity II, Epic Prowess, (DEX=24)<br/>\n28: Champion of Torm(9): DEX+1, (DEX=25)<br/>\n29: Champion of Torm(10): Great Wisdom III, (WIS=19)<br/>\n30: Cleric(16): Great Dexterity III, (DEX=26)<br/>\n31: Cleric(17)<br/>\n32: Cleric(18): DEX+1, (DEX=27)<br/>\n33: Cleric(19): Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=28)<br/>\n34: Cleric(20)<br/>\n35: Cleric(21)<br/>\n36: Monk(5): DEX+1, Great Dexterity V, (DEX=30)<br/>\n37: Monk(6): {Knockdown, Improved Knockdown}<br/>\n38: Cleric(22)<br/>\n39: Cleric(23): Great Dexterity VI, Great Wisdom IV, (DEX=31), (WIS=20)<br/>\n40: Cleric(24): DEX+1, (DEX=32)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHitpoints: 420<br/>\nSkillpoints: 184<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 32/33/37<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8, Mind Effects: +2<br/>\nBAB: 25<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 40 (melee), 37 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 37/37<br/>\nSpell Casting: Cleric(9)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nConcentration 43(45), Heal 18(23), Listen 40(45), Spellcraft 43(44), Tumble 40(51)</div>"
