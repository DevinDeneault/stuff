      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hello again, I am looking to improve this old build I found on your guy's old site. This was done by a Stravinsky00 in 2005 it looks like. This is going to be played on a server where I dont care about XP penalty cause you can lvl to 40 in a day or two. So maybe do a diff. pre-epic split to get the extra AB? I am looking for something that will be hard to hit but hit hard as well and this build seemed to be pretty close to what I was looking for. I am looking for something that will do well in the PvP setting, lvl cap is 40, any race will do and the server this will be played on has gems that can be put on the weapons, like +17 AB, crit gems, +6 to stats like wis, con stuff like that. So saying that, would dueling Kama's be better if you can buff them up like that rather than being an unarmed hitter? The armor on this server is crazy too, with sneeker's getting to 124 ms/hide and people looking for them with just as high Spot/Listen. Once again its easy to get to lvl 40 so early playability is not a big deal.Thanks again for your guy's time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nElf, any lawful alignment<br/>\nSTR 10<br/>\nDEX 20 (32)<br/>\nCON 12<br/>\nWIS 10<br/>\nINT 12<br/>\nCHA 8<br/>\n<br/>\n1: Rogue(1) - Dodge<br/>\n2: Monk(1)<br/>\n3: Rogue(2) - Weapon Finesse<br/>\n4: Monk(2)<br/>\n5: Rogue(3)<br/>\n6: Monk(3) - Weapon Focus (unarmed)<br/>\n7: Monk(4)<br/>\n8: Rogue(4)<br/>\n9: Rogue(5) - Toughness<br/>\n10: Monk(5)<br/>\n11: Monk(6)<br/>\n12: Rogue(6) - Improved Critical (unarmed)<br/>\n13: Rogue(7)<br/>\n14: Monk(7)<br/>\n15: Monk(8) - Blind Fight<br/>\n16: Rogue(8)<br/>\n17: Monk(9)<br/>\n18: Rogue(9) - Mobility<br/>\n19: Rogue(10) - Defensive Roll<br/>\n20: Monk(10)<br/>\n21: Shadowdancer(1) - Epic Weapon Focus (unarmed)<br/>\n22: Rogue(11)<br/>\n23: Monk(11)<br/>\n24: Monk(12) - Great Dex I<br/>\n25: Rogue(12)<br/>\n26: Monk(13)<br/>\n27: Rogue(13) - Epic Dodge, Great Dex II<br/>\n28: Monk(14)<br/>\n29: Rogue(14)<br/>\n30: Rogue(15) - Epic Prowess<br/>\n31: Monk(15)<br/>\n32: Monk(16)<br/>\n33: Rogue(16) - Self Concealment I, II<br/>\n34: Rogue(17)<br/>\n35: Monk(17)<br/>\n36: Monk(18) - Self Concealment III<br/>\n37: Rogue(18)<br/>\n38: Rogue(19) - Self Concealment IV<br/>\n39: Monk(19) - Self Concealment V<br/>\n40: Monk(20)<br/>\n<br/>\nSkills (305 total points)<br/>\nHide 43<br/>\nMove Silently 43<br/>\nTumble 40<br/>\nDiscipline 43<br/>\nUMD 41<br/>\nDisable Trap 25<br/>\nOpen Lock 20<br/>\nSearch 20<br/>\nSpot 30<br/>\n<br/>\nNaked AC - 33 (+1 against current/last target)<br/>\n<br/>\nNaked AB - 39/36/33/30/27 (37/34/31/28/25/37 with Flurry of Blows)<br/>\n<br/>\nNaked Damage - 1d20 + 10d6 sneak attack<br/>\n<br/>\nMax HP - 362<br/>\n<br/>\nSaving Throws:<br/>\nFortitude - 21<br/>\nReflex - 35<br/>\nWill - 20<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I would expect concealment to be readily available, at least as consumables giving Improved Invisibility access, in such an environment. Besides you already have empty body.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy giving SC up you free up 3 general feat slots (2 great dexes and armor skin, which means +3 AC, +1 AB) and 2 bonus rogue feat slots (crippling strike and skill mastery). For the rest, as said, go 12/8 preepic and go kama(s). I'd look into skill points allocation and get epic trap skills and possibly also into going Wis 8/Int 14 for extra skillpoints to pull off all the skills maxing necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other side, if SC has to stay then empty body is redundant and mind immunity is probably replicated by gear in a high magic environment, so you could go for more rogue.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I knew there was some reason for taking them without WM but brain wasn't clicking on all cylinders.  That's for the jump start, Kail! <br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting to spawn another discussion of the merits of HiPS &amp; SC.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue Seeing and Blind Fight will limit the usefulness of either, in my own experience. And in high magic, almost every skin has True Seeing property attached to it and items with that prop abound.  The only way I have found SD all that useful is by virtue of SD 5 to grab the feats as HiPS itself is not all that great in PvP in general and on some servers worthless.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as Empty Body, never liked it.  True, it can't be dispelled, but the duration and uses in limited rest is annoying.  I tried it with a 30+ monk and was still disappointed.  Seems to run out too quickly and you definitely can't keep it active while venturing or it will certainly expire when you need it most. <br/>\n<br/>\nWasting a dispel round on a charging IKD monk leaving stealth is a death sentence.  Let them dispel at their leisure as they will be doing it while laying on their back.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as playing on a hit-on-20-roll only server, sry, can't be of much help with that other than, if that is true, then I would DEFINITELY try to reach the highest APR possible and that means flurry and ITWF.  It's the best way to assure the highest number of opportunity for 20's.  Also, it seems the server to be strongly biased towards a high-strength, high APR DevCrit build of some kind which would likely rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the choice seems clear to me.  The split will pay the price in terms of offensive capability being stuck with unarmed since it is too feat-starved to grab DWing feats while using SD as a tertiary. (yes, Mick, I agree that 2 of the DWing feats are not all that important, but unfortunately ITWF feat has prereqs.  )<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

There's no further AB modifier to KD but the standard -4 AB for simply attempting it. The attack roll is of course checked against target AC.

However, they do have a point about the SC. You're gimping your stats too much to get something you can get through other means. If enough scrolls are available, perhaps dropping them for the feats Kail suggested is the way to go. I certainly wouldn't worry about concealment with high magic item availability. Follow the tweaks Hip, Kail and all the others have suggested, like going 12/8 pre-epic, taking more Dex, Armor Skin and try getting Crippling Strike, which is, as the name suggests, crippling for your enemies. Post an updated version of the build and we'll have another look at it. Unless you really screw up second time around, it should be much closer to ready than your first attempt. Ofc you can't drop Dodge or mobility, that was just something Hip momentarily overlooked, and I think your final spread is pretty optimized with 20 / 19 / 1. Don't drop monk levels if you go unarmed because they are the ones that increase your unarmed damage. This toon should be like the flash with perma-haste!<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Rogue has such diverse epic feats that replacing SC5 with Empty Body (against bosses like Kail suggested and perhaps PvP) and those conceal scrolls would open up some more possibilities.  If you can find/buy Ethereal Visage scrolls you can walk right through Evard's Tentacles without taking damage.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhether a tertiary class is beneficial or not, well... let's consider that.  <br/>\nPossibilities: 1-4 Levels Ftr (WS/EWS + another feat), 1 Clc (late Spellcraft dump w/domains; bump WIS for spells), 1 Wiz (late Spellcraft dump, level 1 spells, familiar), 1 Rgr (FE, Trackless Step)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Monk 21/Rogue 19 split is not bad at all as it stands.  You'd be getting decent sneaks on a high APR, high speed, sneaky toon which is nothing to sneeze at.  If what you are inferring about crit immunes not being that pervasive is true, then SA is a good option and perhaps Imp SA is the way to go.  Otherwise, as usual for a dexer, damage is the main issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you have controlled the feat management you may want to consider halfling to gain AB &amp; AC plus all the other lucky and sneaky race benefits.

If True Seeing is modified, he won't be seen nearly as often and HiPS will be EXCELLENT for both offense and for fleeing, healing etc... As for damage, it's a VERY HIGH MAGIC environment, so WS and EWS will do nothing worthwhile in a +17 weapon comparatively. The only feat I could see him dropping is Toughness, pre-epic, and maybe two of the epic SC feats could go to make him a DWer, as I agree in such a high magic setting the more attacker per round, the better it is for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

On the other it seems spot/listen can reach very high scores, but probably those can be countered by equivalently high scores in hide/ms (please campgod confirm the presence of hide/ms enhancing gear). I'd say that in such an environment one wants to get SF:hide/ms.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith scrolls of II easily available and that uber speed (made further uber by a perma/temporary haste) I'd safely drop SCV in favor of extra feats, as I detailed above. Even more so if <strong>wands</strong> of improved invisibility are available (wands cast faster than scrolls and are similarly uninterruptable and not counterable). One also has empty body to fall upon, just in case. Unarmed could be a good choice if one can get good gloves and a maxed wis to make good use of SF. On the other hand kama means an extra gear slot for enhancements, keen and is generally favored by high magic settings, unless the module builders take steps towards correcting the inherent disadvantage of gloves enchantments. Also, one can choose to dw even without the feats in a battle of 20s.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd consider going halfling using a single kama (deflect arrows vs archers, it's like a second ED vs ranged attacks) to get a further +1 AB/AC. The extra AB alone is more than enough to offset the loss of damage in unarmed strike and of single kama vs medium sized unarmed.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

What it does is reduce the off-hand penalty of your attacks. may not make much of a difference if you only hit on 20s, and the +1 ab was probably from BAB increase, as Ambi doesn't increase your AB.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Halfling is a small race and hence you'll get a diminished unarmed damage in addition to giving up one gear slot (main hand). Using a single kama means the offhand is free to deflect arrows or to wield something like a holy symbol or other off hand (non weapon) piece of gear for extra enhancements. At the same time halfling small race grants +1 AB/+1 AC not counting towards any cap, which alone is more than enough to offset the lack of a offhand weapon, as said above.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact  you are having difficulties knocking NPCs down is because as a halfling you are dual wielding kamas without even TWF. <strong>A very bad idea</strong>. That means -6 AB for both the main and the off hand, since kamas are not tiny weapons (which a halfling needs in the offhand to minimize penalties). Forget about dw kamas with a halfling unless you are locked in a battle of 20s.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Elf has search/spot/listen boni together with perma active search and can get the 2 extra attacks per round from full dual wielding... which require a 3 feat investment (something you do not really have room for in the build). Me, I'd go with halfling, even if choosing unarmed in the end. Given the high magic environment, the differential in base damage is probably not really meaningful. The extra AB instead is.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
