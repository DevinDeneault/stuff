However:<br/>\n<br/>\n It would be nice if you could cross-train Tumble to 20. That would gain you +4 AC. I think that might be preferable over Concentration. A failed save against Taunt will cost you up to 6 AC for 5 rounds, but failure to get that 20 Tumble will cost you 4 AC all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n I know that 4 Intimidate is required for WM, but why did you cross-train another 2 Intimidate?

Now I have a trusted expert on side, I shall amend - particularly as it helps the crappy AC, which still remains problematic - as do the saves. As to the additional Intimidate ranks, that was simply down to me not thinking there'd be additional value in taking a 'new' skill at that late stage. Again, I will edit (probably for Heal).<br/>\n<br/>\n While I think on it, I've noticed the Spot v Listen debate elsewhere on the forum, so if anyone wants to swap the one for the other, that's grand - i went for Listen primarily because Mr Stonefoot won't run round corners - or anywhere else - unless he has to.<br/>\n<br/>\n Please bear with me for the edit - I'm using pen and paper (very old-school, I know).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

BAB is 30, AB is 51 and your damage is also wrong. You seem to be counting capped STR in your stats.<br/>\n<br/>\n AB = BAB + STR + WF, EWF, EP. <br/>\n<br/>\n I think your AC will be low no matter what, so I wonder why you took Armor Skin. It's not going to increase your AC to a point where you won't be hit, and since you're relying on DR, I wonder why you didn't go for the EDR feats or more DD levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n Basically, DD and WM don't really add up all that well. If you are going to stand in front of them and ignore damage, then you don't need Crit Enhancements (AB enhancements would be more useful). Conversely, if you are going to devcrit them or just crit a lot and break skulls, then you don't need DR all that much.<br/>\n<br/>\n For the OCs, anything will work, so if that's where you're planning to play it, go for it. otherwise, you'll be in trouble for the most part, as your DR isn't high enough to stand in front of them with a 2-hander with such low AC and your AB isn't high enough for you to hit (let alone crit) on a regular basis.<br/>\n<br/>\n That's my true honest opinion of this guy.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I don't know what you mean by 'capped STR'? Genuine ignorance, I ask simply for knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\n I ummed and aahed about Armor Skin, but whether to take that feat or Epic Reflexes. I'd already gone through the Epic DR debate in my mind, and held to the view that adding 5 to CON (and thereby losing 5 STR) wasn't something I was prepared to do. By the same token, I thought that taking the OW/Dev Crit route would mean I'd have to soak less damage before enemies popped their clogs in any event. I had contemplated giving him a Warhammer (fed up with Dwarfs and axes) and shield, but thougt a Heavy Flail would be a nice variation - and it's the only bludgeoner with a 19-20 critical threat. Happy to change it, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n I know you have a downer on the OC (and you're not alone in that - but let's not forget we wouldn't have the game at all without it), but this was meant as a build that could be either a solo traveller wheresoever he roamed, or a handy doorstop in a party, to allow the flash boys to show off. He was, in other words, never going to be the definitive DD or WM, or even Fighter - it's about levels of balance. Nearly 600 HPs ain't too shoddy, I think - and equally, nor is the AB.<br/>\n<br/>\n I do appreciate your comments/advice, though I don't see the WM/DD dichotomy - it's surely a sensible offense/defense mix - tell me why I'm wrong, please!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The last AB point comes from SWF at WM 5.<br/>\n The AC is a bit low for playing with a two-hander, at least by ECB standards.

It describes a lot of important concepts that u need to grasp to be a good character builder. BAB progression is one of them. It grows at the rate of 1 every odd level after 20 and for the first 20 levels it's class-related. In your case, u only took classes that have a full BAB progression, so you have 20 BAB from the first 20 levels and 10 from levels 21-40. 30 is not bad, it's the MAXIMUM BAB that you can have with any character.<br/>\n<br/>\n The problem in this build is not much the way you built the character, but your choice of classes. DD is a defensive class which needs to be taken heavily to achieve its bets results. WM is a very good offensive class that also needs to be taken heavily to achieve good results. Since you only have 40 levels to juggle, they don't work well together.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I have read your guide (even though I may forget a few bits occasionally), and grand reading it was,thank you. However, surely the point of having a guild like this is not to simply follow accepted practice - otherwise there would be definitive 'best builds' which would be uncontestable - but to strive for builds that are a joy to play, quirks and all? Now, if we accept that, is there a problem with trying to merge an 'optimum' defence class with an 'optimum' offence class?

This would allow you to change 8 levels from Fighter to DD (2 pre-epic and 6 epic), using DD feats for EWF, EP, and AS, and using all 7 epic general feats for Great STR, ending with 34 STR. You would gain +1 AB and damage from STR, 6 more points of damage reduction, and 4 more uses of Defensive Stance. Also, it would then be fine to stick with a heavy flail.<br/>\n With all that STR damage (times 1.5 for a 2-handed weapon) + EWS + crits powered up by WM, you won't miss Dev Crit much.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hey Stag!<br/>\n<br/>\n I have explained the 30 BAB thing in my last post, but in case you didn't get it, it's only class related for the first 20 levels. In epics, you gain 1 BAB at every odd level regardless of class (if you wanted, you could take 20 Wizard levels and you'd still end up on 30 BAB). I hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for combining defense and offense, the problem you face here is the tradeoff (every point you put in STR in one less point you put in CON and every WM level is one less DD level). Buy, if you still want to make this concept work and balance things out, I suggest fewer Fighter levels and more WM. The GREAT thing you get with WM is not the crit enhancement, it's the AB bonus from ESWF. You could try to make him a Fighter 10 WM 16 DD 14. You'd lose 2 feats, which you can easily accomodate by dropping Devcrit (I agree with Empyre on this one). You'd gain 2 AB for your trouble. I think this alternative spread would be much more balanced and help you achieve your goal. Pre-epic you can go Fighter 7 WM 7 DD 6 or even Fighter 9 WM 7 DD 4 depending on the number of feats you need for all your combat essentials. You'll have 2 WM bonus Feats for EWF and EP, one or two Fighter bonus feats for EWS (and maybe Epic Fortitude) and the DD bonus Feat for Armor Skin, which would work better with a shield. <br/>\n<br/>\n That's my 2c on this concept.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You would use the Fighter 10 feat for that, leaving the general feats still free for Great STR. According to what I read in NWNWiki, your damage reduction would be 15/-,\u00a0 not just 11/-.<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Dwarven_defender\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Dwarven_defender</a><br/>\n<br/>\n To make your character building easier, you could use the character build calculator, and if you don't have Excel, you can use the free Open Office, like I do.<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/other/tool/characterbuildcalculator-cbc\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn ... ulator-cbc</a><br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.openoffice.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.openoffice.org/</a><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You did see something about EWS, but I worked out the Fighter bit (as you mentioned) so removed the edit - I thought before anyone had noticed! Equally, I have clocked my dumbness re Damage Reduction and have corrected this in the new thread just posted - Grim 2.0.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
