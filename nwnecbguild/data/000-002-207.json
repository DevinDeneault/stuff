      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hello All,<br/>\n<br/>\n I've been looking through non-arcanist Harper Scout combos in the Filter and Archive - mostly because I've never played one, and wanted to understand more of its dynamic - and a few things have struck me that I hope you can cast some light upon...<br/>\n<br/>\n The first is one no one can do anything about, but it seems odd to me that a \"scout\" doesn't have Search as a class skill, particularly as you need 4 ranks in the skill before you can take the class. Hey-ho.<br/>\n<br/>\n Secondly, no one seems to take Persuade past the 8 prerequisite ranks. Is there a particular reason for this, or is it simply that other skills take precedence in complete builds? By the same token, the description of the class would seem to suggest enhanced CHA would be a good thing, but the only build I can find that plays up to this is Thazzle's Harper Champion (Fighter 15 / HS 5 / Paladin 20), which merges the class with Pally to give a natural synergy.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thazzle's build and Hip's recent Wulgar Ironbow (Fighter 16 / HS 5 / DwD 19) also appear to be the only two DEXers in town (still talking non-arcanist), while there are several STR-based, full plate wearing Scouts out there. Again, is there anything particular that seems to point builds in that direction?<br/>\n<br/>\n I ask particularly because I'm soon to start constructing (another) RP character. There are 5 of us in a commitment to go adventuring together, and the rest haven't played NwN before, so I've been given the task of pulling some characters together for them, taking account of their preferences and character back-stories. Thus far, I've been able to nick, virtually intact, a couple of builds from the Guild, but this one's proving a tough nut to crack. Non evil, non lawful, non spellcasting, human, party leader (so persuasive and/or charismatic), not feeble, but not a mountain of muscle, focused in melee. My thinking to date has led me to consider a Fighter/CoT/HS, but I wanted to check your collective thoughts on HS before I fully tip myself down that rabbit hole.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks in advance<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">The prereqs do not necessarily indicate a class proficiency, Stagmeister.<br/>\n<br/>\n Blackguard's Hide skill prereq, likewise, does not reflect an actual synergy.\u00a0 The bottom line: prestige prereqs are more of a class balancing measure than some sort of roleplay integration.<br/>\n<br/>\n As far as trying to roleplay a Harper Scout, specifically... \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n I wouldn't advise venturing into that arena.\u00a0 Maybe just settle for an \"influence\" rather than some distinct expression of the class in your interactions.<br/>\n<br/>\n The Harpers have gone through so many transformations during their history... well... it's no wonder they are considered a secret society.\u00a0 They defy identity.\u00a0 They probably have a problem recognizing their own members if it weren't for their customary adornments and signets.\u00a0 Historically... bards, druids, rangers and some wizards (nope, never any reference to sorcerers, contrary to NWN's interpretation) spent time among the Harper ranks. An HS is sort of like an elvish, arcane ranger that can disappear when it needs to.\u00a0 Though their nom de plume seems to infer a bardic origin, it actually was derived from a family crest that had no relationship to bards or entertaining the masses.\u00a0 I don't think their persuasiveness was ever considered their forte'.\u00a0 IMO an Intimidation skill bias would more accurately reflect how members of their society interacted with those outside of their cloister.\u00a0 Try not to make sense of Bioware's version of AD&amp;D 3.0. It is plagued with inconsistencies and arbitrary decisions.\u00a0 Accept them \"as is\" (like buying a used car) and just roleplay around them.<br/>\n<br/>\n The term \"scout\" refers to their special abilities.\u00a0 NWN's version of HS's detection bias is limited to spotting traps with Deneir's eye and a good ear (Listen), but the true Harper has elvish blood and access to a more substantial spellcasting repertoire that can boost their discovery talents.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, my advice is to ignore the roleplay aspects of the class and focus on its advantages being the only prestige Tumble class that can dump to Discipline and economical bonus feats, especially in epic levels.\u00a0 You can glean all its advantages in just 5 levels which leaves a large pool to develop other classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, both of their ability buffs will stack with pot buffs so, for example, if you roll a lucky 4 on both casts, the respective abilities can be boosted up to +10 (or +5 modifier)!.\u00a0 That's HUGE for a non-spellcaster with only mundane resources.<br/>\n<br/>\n The main disadvantage of considering HS are all the prereqs needed for just 5 levels.\u00a0 That's not always easy to justify.\u00a0 Neither assassins nor BGs can be an HS but the class is generally easy to integrate into most combos.<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That's fine, I can work with that.<br/>\n<br/>\n And I suppose your cited downside of all the prereqs for a mere 5 levels is also there to act as a form of balance (no Harper pun intended). Much as all the malarkey one needs to accrue to achieve WM status.<br/>\n<br/>\n No knowledge is wasted, I hope. This should at least make any future build request stuff from me slightly less crappy (at least in this instance).
