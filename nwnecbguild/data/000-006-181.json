HIPS gives good crowd control.<br/>\nThe stealth skills are very good with the skill boosting feats.<br/>\nThe spell DC is good, and Necro is an excellent choice to focus in.<br/>\n35 levels of wizard gives adequate spell penetration.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe build is indeed open to any race, but half-orc is of course at a disadvantage with its intelligence penalty. Both elf and halfling have the dexterity bonus. And both races will also work well\u00a0with rogue instead of assassin without suffering an xp penalty. Halfling will have better AB, AC and stealth.<br/>\nThe DC for Death attack paralysis is only 23. I would have taken rogue instead of assassin. Rogue will also bring more skill points to the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nAB will almost always be low with such a wizard intense build. I don't understand why you have taken the TWF related feats. This is not a build with focus on physical combat. You have not taken one AB enhancing feat (WF, EWF, Epic prowess).<br/>\n<br/>\nA general rule is not to take pre epic feats in epic feat slots. There are exceptions. But you don't have to do it here.<br/>\nAuto quicken offers little. You achieve the same with haste. Use a perma-haste item, or buff with extended haste before battle instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have not given us the starting and ending abilities of your build except for intelligence that starts at 17 and ends at 30. I can Guess from the skill listing that Dexterity is 18. But that's it.<br/>\nHave a look at the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/character-builds-posting-rules-t515321.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Character builds Posting Rules</a> for Reference.<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line: This wizard will do what you set out to do. But there is room for improvement. You should be able to\u00a0add a coupe of epic spells and still have room for some more great intelligence feats.</div>",
