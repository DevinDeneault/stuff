She is supposed to enter fights after casting (Extended) Bless, Aid, Divine Power, Divine Favor, War Cry and Song/Curse Song to reach the AB bonus cap. She can cast Harm/Heal including from self-scribed scrolls, for any enemy who cannot resist spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: A melee fighter with 34 AB? You\u2019ve got to be kidding!<br/>\nA: This character can easily reach the +20 cap on AB bonus, add to that +6 from capped STR from items and we get to 60. To that, add +6 effective AB from Curse Song and another +6 from very-hard-to-resist Taunt, and we get an effective 72 AB. Not so bad, huh?<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: I am intrigued, tell me more stats.<br/>\nA: Gladly!\n<ul>\n<li>Damage (mundane scimitar): 1d6 +5+6 (STR) +1d6+6 (Darkfire) +4 (Divine Favor) +2 (Song) +5 (GMW) = 2d6+28, crit 12-20x2</li>\n<li>AC: 30 (plate &amp; shield) + 25 (+5 bonuses) +6 (Song) +4 (Haste) +2 (effective from Curse Song) +2 (cap DEX) +1 (Mage Armor) = 70, can be improved with Expertise.</li>\n</ul>\n\nQ: Ok, but why on Oerth 2 Blackguard levels?<br/>\nA: For saves and martial weapon proficiency, and not incurring any XP penalty. An alternative is 2 Fighter levels, which frees up up to 4 feats (dropping Cleave). Another option is Cleric 13 / Fighter 1 to open up Word of Faith, and yet another one is flat-out Cleric 15 / Bard 25. These are all valid alternatives, but different builds.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: Why not Divine Might and/or Divine Shield? It\u2019s even thematically appropriate!<br/>\nA: Assuming Haste is on, this character takes two rounds to buff up. Divine Favor lasts 20 rounds and Divine Power lasts 24 rounds, and non-Lasting Song lasts 10 rounds. Result: you need to rebuff quite often. Adding another full round of buffs that last 9 rounds each seemed to cross the \u201cunplayable\u201d line (not to mention the extreme tightness on feats). It is a pity, but sacrifices had to be made.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: How much Perform will I need from items if I play this?<br/>\nA: You need 80 for level 26 Song, which means you are 24 short. If, however, you can get just +12 Perform from items (including CHA bonus), you can sing a level 23 Song for yourself and get the remaining +12 from it for Curse Song. So: 24 Perform for level 26 Song/Curse Song, or 12 Perform for level 23 Song/level 26 Curse Song.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: Is this build really better than a Bard 26 / RDD 10 / BG 4?<br/>\nA: No. She reaches the same AB buffed as the RDD has unbuffed, give or take (which means that if e.g. +10 weapons and/or DP scrolls are available, the RDD is far better). The RDD has better HP, fire immunity, and 4 more AC. The RDD can make use of Divine Might/Shield, having only one short-term buff (Song). There are however two things that the Cantor does better:\n<ul>\n<li>Harm (including from scrolls) is massive. It is in my top 4 offensive spells in the game, even though in this case it will not pierce any kind of SR.</li>\n<li>AB being equal, the RDD\u2019s hasted progression is (say) +60/+55/+50/+45/+60, while the Cantor\u2019s is +60/+55/+50/+60/+55. This is quite a noticeable difference, and somewhat compensates for her need to spend rounds re-buffing.</li>\n</ul>\nOverall I don\u2019t think this is a stronger class combination, but Bard 26 / RDD 10 / BG 4 is one of the absolute best builds in NWN, so if this one comes close I\u2019m not complaining.<br/>\n<br/>\nQ: Has this been done before?<br/>\nA: Of course, but not like this. I found these builds in the old archives and the forum:\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build297350.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Divine Melody - Cleric11 Bard23 CoT6</a>: similar idea, Bard buffs are not undispellable, lower AB and lower saves (with a CHA buff). Has a very good DM and DS.</li>\n<li><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build274945.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Devout songster - Cleric 13 Bard23 Fighter4</a>: very similar, not undispellable, worse saves, XP penalty, but higher AB and level 7 spells.</li>\n<li><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/church-choir-singer-cleric-16-bard-20-fighter-4-t2329890.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Church Choir Singer - Cleric 16 Bard20 Fighter4</a>: maybe the most similar in spirit, but chooses to get higher AB, AC and damage instead of saves, utility (Scribe and Still) and HP. I\u2019m not a huge fan of DM and DS in this one, for the reasons I explained.</li>\n<li><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build228750.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Happy Helper - Cleric 18 Bard 20 BG 2</a>\u00a0and <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build128675.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ancilla - Cleric 17 Bard 20 Sorcerer 3</a>: these are party-focused builds that would not reach high enough AB for my taste to be considered meleers.</li>\n<li><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build244089.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Harbinger of Sorrow - Cleric 19 Bard 20 SD 1</a>: this one is a weird dual caster with SF:Evocation. I love this kind of builds, but I would not choose Bard as one of my two casting classes. Have to try it out, I guess.</li>\n</ul>\n\nSo there you are, enjoy Bard+Cleric power, and feel free to provide comments, suggestions, or questions regarding the build!</div>"
