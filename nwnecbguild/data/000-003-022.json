      "content": "<div>I'm 100% new to neverwinter I just downloaded it the other day. One of those games I remember hearing alot about when it came out but never got around to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I've always had trouble with DnD games cause they can be a bit overwhelming. I'm looking to make a weapon master that uses 2 handed axe or sword. I'm leaning heavily towards dwarf cause DD defense + offense seems beastly. Although I am open to half orc builds. Don't need to worry about any spells . Figured fighter/wm/DD is all I need.I really just need a breakdown of when and what lvls of classes, feats and skills I will need. I think it's going to be max level of 20? Not sure how high it goes I'm only playing offline. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any help you guys can give. Been jumping into a lot of old RPGs I never got to play!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hi there, Malvus - and welcome!<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand entirely the concept of Fighter/ Weapon Master/ Dwarven Defender - indeed, it was my first published build here (Grim Stonefoot), but I'm less sure about it now. I'm now much more tempted by the idea of either a great DwD <em><strong>or</strong></em> a great WM. It's hard to get both to work properly. A full-blooded DwD is exactly that: a defender, so pumping in damage resistance is great, and soaking up damage is important, as in - \"You shall not pass!\"<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, Weapon Master is primarily about bobbing and weaving while delivering critical hits - more \"get out of my way, and do it quickly\". There's probably a clue in that WM doesn't have Heavy Armour built in.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are better solutions out there, I think. But you need to be sure about what you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou'll notice that I'm fudging - this is until someone who knows more comes along...<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> If you'd like a look at Grim's build, it's on page 4 of the Full Epic sub-forum.</div>",

The only way to get more feats would be going human - so DwD becomes unavailable - thus it's all a bit \"aargh!\" I suppose you could lose something else (Imp Crit or Blind Fighting maybe), but think about what you'd be sacrificing for an extra potential hit...<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I hinted at, the immediate appeal of a character that excels at both offence and defence is alluring, but the sods won't let you do it properly, damn them!
