This strategy utilises an understanding of the detection mechanics of the NWN.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you find this helpful. If you have any additions or further comments, or if things are difficult to understand feel free to comment or send me a PM<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Minimum prerequisites:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n- Ranged weapon (longbow, shortbow, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, sling, darts, t<span style=\"color:#131513\">hrowing\u00a0</span>axes, shuriken)<br/>\n- Ammunition (arrows, bolts, bullets, darts, throwing axes, shuriken)<br/>\n<br/>\nAll characters can use at least one ranged weapon.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAll classes except druids (darts/sling) may equip heavy and light crossbows without additional proficiencies.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Further improving ranged combat prowess:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nThis can be achieved by:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Increasing the Ranged AB through racial choice (ie. Halfling provides +3 ranged AB with a sling, with small stature, good aim and +2 dexterity), feats (ie. Weapon Foci, Enchant Arrow), base attributes (Dexterity or Wisdom with Zen Archery), items (ie. Longbow +1, Ring of Dexterity +2), spells (ie. Divine Favor, Cats Grace)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Increasing the chance to hit against concealed (ie improved invisibility) or unseen enemies (ie 'listened' but not spotted enemies) with Blind Fight<br/>\n<br/>\n- Increasing the Ranged Damage per hit through character feats (ie. Improved Critical, Weapon Specialization, Bane of Enemies, Divine Might, Enchant Arrow), items (ie. Composite Longbow +1 with +3 mighty, Arrows +4) or spells (ie. Divine Favor).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n- Strength may increase ranged damage through the mighty item property. For bows, crossbows, slings and shuriken, this is required to be a magical property, and in most environments is commonly limited to +5. Darts and throwing axes intrinsically have the mighty property, and has no cap (ie. a throwing axe used by a 30 Str Fighter will have +10 strength damage added to each successful hit).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n- Avoiding having low strength unless you are wielding a crossbow. Having a negative strength modifier (ie. Strength less than 10) will lead to a reduction in ranged damage, unless the wielder is using a either a light or heavy crossbow.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n- Increasing the number of ranged attacks per turn, with Rapid Shot (for all weapons except crossbows), Rapid Reload (allowing crossbows more than 1 attack/round), the Haste magical item property or the Haste/Mass Haste spell<br/>\n<br/>\n- Detecting enemies before they detect you. The further away you attack, the greater advantage you have with your ranged weapon. This is can be enhanced with detection skills (spot and/or listen), detect mode, spells (Ultravision, See Invisibility, True Sight), equipment (ie. Watchman's Helm or Greater Robe of Eyes), high Wisdom scores, or certain feats (such as Elf Keen Senses and skill bonuses).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n- Utilising stealth to detect enemies before they detect you allowing you to attack at a distance, or to elude detection after being discovered, by going around corners, utilizing Hide in Plain Sight, or cleverly managing the NWN engine's detection mechanism.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Slowing enemy movement speed after they detect you. This could be through the use of traps such as tangle/frost/sonic/acid blob traps, spells such as grease or hold monster, feats such as Called Shot (leg).<br/>\n<br/>\n- Speeding up your own movement after detection, through the use of feats (such as Monk Speed), spells (Expedious Retreat, Haste, Mass Haste) or items<br/>\n<br/>\n- Preventing enemies from entering melee range through party members (ie a melee fighter teammate), companions/summons (ie. Summon Creature VI), or terrain (ie standing on a cliff ledge, shooting over barricades)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Devastating Critical can also be obtained on a ranged weapon (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/aelynthi-the-deadly-bard-7-arcane-archer-23-rdd-10-t2355162.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Red Dragon Disciple</a> is a nice way to obtain this without hurting ranged AB, <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/viewtopic.php?p=18440#p18440\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">half-orc is another potential option</a>)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Strong ranged builds</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nExamples of strong ranged builds include:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Elf or half-elven Arcane Archer<br/>\n- Cleric Wisdom based Zen Archer or Arbalest<br/>\n- Fighter Archer or Crossbowman<br/>\n- High level Ranger Archer or Arbalest<br/>\n- Rogue/Assassin Archers or Arbalest<br/>\n- Divine Might users (Paladin/Blackguard/Cleric) to add damage to ranged attacks<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Ranged strategy: The Pull</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nThis is one of the most valuable strategies for any NWN player to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe concept is to:\u00a0<br/>\n- detect an individual enemy without them detecting you first<br/>\n- shoot them with a ranged weapon aiming to only make one enemy chase you<br/>\n- retreat to a safe location without any other additional enemies<br/>\n- defeat them if possible, using melee weapons, spells, or other strategies (see below)<br/>\n<br/>\nEnemies in NWN modules tend to group up in mobs, so singling out individuals makes life much easier.<br/>\n<br/>\nWands may achieve the same purpose however the range of a ranged weapon will likely be far superior.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Ranged strategy: Pull into traps</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nThis is pretty simple, and you add traps to the previous strategy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese could be damaging (such as fire/electrical traps), disable (such as frost/sonic/acid blob traps) or slowing traps (such as tangle traps).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nTangle traps have great DC (minor tangle DC 20 to deadly tangle DC 35) compared with other traps (a deadly frost trap has a DC of 15 for example).<br/>\n<br/>\nTraps additionally can be stacked forcing your opponent to make multiple DC saves.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpells may also act as 'traps', such as glyph of warding and delayed blast fireball.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Ranged strategy: Put a summon or teammate in the way</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the same strategy as the pull, except you put a summon (using spells or UMD) or a melee teammate in the way, allowing you to shoot away unimpeded.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Ranged strategy: Put terrain in the way</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nBasically you shoot enemies with cliffs / rivers / barricades in the way. They can't reach you with melee weapons, and you blast them with your ranged prowess.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Ranged strategy: Utilize\u00a0stealth - the Stealth-&gt;Attack-&gt;Move-&gt;Stealth (SAMS) strategy</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a strategy that @BlackCobra taught me with melee stealthers. I have applied this to ranged builds and I appreciate him giving me permission to share this information with you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis only works against NPCs and creatures. This will not work against players.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is how to do it:<br/>\n<br/>\n- approach an enemy NPC/creature undetected (<em>stealth</em>)<br/>\n<br/>\n- attack this enemy, breaking stealth/invisibility (<em>attack</em>)<br/>\n<br/>\n- <em>as quickly as possible</em> order a move to a different location (<em>move</em>) then <em>as quickly as possible</em> enter stealth mode (<em>stealth</em>)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you have done this successfully you will re-enter stealth mode without the enemy detecting you.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe faster you do this, the more likely you will be successful.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can repeat this process until you fail your combination, then you will need to choose a different strategy, such as ones discussed previously, or stealthing around a corner.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy does this work? To understand why this works, one requires an understanding of how detection works in NWN.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly, for players detection almost feels continuous.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever for NPCs, detection is much more periodic.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is from the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Detect\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NWN Wiki Detect</a>, which is quoting a forum post from BioWare employee Brendon Holmes:<br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>Passive (default) mode</strong><br/>\n<em>[...]<br/>\nSpot/listen roll:</em>\u00a0d10 + half skill<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Active (detect) mode</strong><br/>\n[..]<em>Spot/listen roll:</em>\u00a0d20 + full skill<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Stealth checks</strong><br/>\n<em>Player detects stealth:</em>\u00a05 times per second<br/>\n<em>NPC detects stealth:</em>\u00a04 seconds<br/>\n<em>Creatures roll for hide/move silently/spot/listen:</em>\u00a0every 6 seconds</div></blockquote>\nUsing these details, in a PvM situation a NPC or Creature at a rate of 3-5% (or 20-30 times less frequently than) of a player.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a huge difference. I am unsure why it was coded in such a way.<br/>\n<br/>\nTherefore there is a 4-6 second window in which a player can potentially 'restealth' without being formally detected.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a series of screenshots to demonstrate the stealth-&gt;attack-&gt;move-&gt;stealth process.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<span class=\"inline-attachment\">\n<dl class=\"fileimage display\">\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/202001/10759084_ccd6a0ee8f50fefe84662006c957abcd_t.jpg\" />\n</dl>\n</span><br/>\nI am stealthed and undetected by all the enemies in the screenshot.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI attack the troll with my longbow then, as quickly as possible move to the green arrow located on the screen, then as quickly as possible activate stealth (I used the F1 quickbar hotkey in this example).<br/>\n<br/>\n<span class=\"inline-attachment\">\n<dl class=\"fileimage display\">\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/202001/10759084_4abba815e1b99ff3bf02999e20981c9e_t.jpg\" />\n</dl>\n</span><br/>\nThe troll walks to my location which I had attacked him, whilst I relocate, undetected to the new location.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span class=\"inline-attachment\">\n<dl class=\"fileimage display\">\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/202001/10759084_f6e690c2f57425176b3cb0da48b9790e_t.jpg\" />\n</dl>\n</span><br/>\nI repeat the same process in this screenshot.

Monk speed is superior to barbarian speed as it unlocks the default movement speed cap and one can move combine expedious retreate/mass haste/perma-haste with monk speed to move <em>extremely </em>fast.<br/>\n<br/>\n- making your opponent slower, with tangle traps, called shot (leg), or spells such as grease/slow etc<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this is insightful to you!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Does it work with slings? Crossbows? I keep one finger pushing down W to keep moving forward while I'm shooting at the same time by clicking on enemies with the left mouse button. Sometimes, it works. I'm shooting while I run without even stopping, turning and aiming. It's hilarious when it works. But more often my character just slows down when I click on an enemy behind me but doesn't shoot and eventually I've either slowed down too much or I've run out of space to run so I have to melee.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone explain how to master kiting?

Set a metronome or get used to counting out the 6 seconds in your head. Say I have two attacks on the first flurry, and I have Called Shot: Leg on F4. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe way I used to do it is to do F4-left click-F4-left click to queue up two called shots, let go of E (forward) for a split second until you slow down a bit, then resume running. This is the tricky bit, you do not have to wait all the while until the first projectile of the flurry fires but as I recall I had to let go of forward for a little bit. Every first flurry attack will fire, even though the animation would suggest that this is impossible.<br/>\n<br/>\nCalled shot: Leg stacks indefinitely, and the movement reduction stacks mulitiplicatively (a stack of five means 1*(0,8^5) = ~33% movement speed for the victim, NOT immobilisation), but every shot has its own 4-round timer, that is, hitting a target already affected by CS:L with another one does not refresh the stack.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Say I have two attacks on the first flurry, and I have Called Shot: Leg on F4.</div></blockquote>\nI do use that camera mode and I do zoom out. I'm able to shoot the first flurry (as you said), then run then turn and shoot, etc. But I haven't been able to master the art of shooting while running.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>The way I used to do it is to do F4-left click-F4-left click to queue up two called shots, let go of E (forward) for a split second until you slow down a bit, then resume running. This is the tricky bit, you do not have to wait all the while until the first projectile of the flurry fires but as I recall I had to let go of forward for a little bit. Every first flurry attack will fire, even though the animation would suggest that this is impossible.</div></blockquote>\nI'm a little bit confused here because I thought WebShaman and others were saying that you don't need to ever let go of W (that's what I use to move forward). What you're saying does make sense, though. If I can't figure out how to shoot without letting go of W, I will try your method, which I'm quite sure will work since it makes a lot of sense.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I was pushing down W to move forward while I was also left-clicking (a bit like a madman) on the enemy I was targeting. As a result, I wasn't shooting but I was periodically slowing down. I'll try just clicking once and waiting patiently for my toon to shoot while I'm running forward.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
