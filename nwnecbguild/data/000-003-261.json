      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Give us some more details about the specifics of the Bard song in Arelith GtB, is the song the same as original NwN, the duration of the epic song, if the AC bonuses from Divine Shield are affected from the number of the Paladin lvls and so on. Many of the low-magic, restricted lvls PW's have altered the rules in a significant way so we need all the info we can get. We are already aware of the rule of \"three straight\" lvls before you can switch to another class you have there, if that helps. If you want me to make a rough estimate, i think that a Bard 26/ Paladin 4 is the best you can do if you like to keep the \"Undispellable\" of your Bard spells. How important is that to you?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">If there are no changes to Bard song at all then the epic song is really good and Bard 26/ Paladin 4 will allow you to achieve most/all of what you are looking for. If you want to incorporate other things to your build like enhanced saving throws then Bard 16/ CoT 10/ Paladin 4 is also very good and will allow you for a slight better Ab as well. Personally i would go for Bard 26/ Paladin 4, simple but works wonders and you have both undispellable buffs but also two epic bonus feats. I guess you can achieve 25th lvl Bard song (75 ranks in perform) in your server with skill boosts? If yes, then definitely go for that, 25th lvl Bard song plus 25th lvl Curse song on your enemies in addition to Divine Shield/ Might\u00a0 and High Taunt, are going to wreck them.<br/>\n<br/>\n (STR 16 (24)\u00a0 DEX 08\u00a0 CON 14\u00a0 INT 12\u00a0 WIS 08\u00a0 CHA 16) - Human<br/>\n<br/>\n Pre-Epic Feats: WF: Longsword, IC: Longsword, Power Attack, Divine Shield, Divine Might, Blind Fight, Still Spell, Curse Song<br/>\n<br/>\n Epic Feats: EWF: Longsword, Epic Prowess, Armour Skin, Great STR I, Lasting Inspiration (Bard Bonus), ESF: Perform (Bard Bonus)<br/>\n<br/>\n Pre-Epic split is (Bard 16/ Paladin 4) in order to achieve 16 BAB and four attacks, then go all ten Bard obviously. You can take any martial weapon that you like, i just choose longsword because it is a universally good option and allows for the shield's AC. If you are able to select stat gifts (if they are available on Arelith now) then go for STR and CHA, the more you have from both, the better. There is also another choice that i did not mention, the (Bard 16/ RDD 10/ Paladin 4) if you go for raw power but i don't know if RDD's are changed on Arelith and anyway the Epic Bard song is really powerful on itself.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The downside to this build is that you would lose both the undispellability of your buffs and that your bard song/ curse song would only last for 10 rounds instead of 100 rounds. In addition, many spells that depend on your caster level would be significantly reduced in power. For example \" wounding whispers \", a bard spell that causes sonic damage to your enemies each time they hit you with a melee weapon would have only half of it's original power (1d6+16 Vs 1d6 +26). On the plus side, the (bard 16/ cot 10/ paladin 4) combo would be able to pick up a couple of feats more, like \" knockdown \" and \" extend spell \".

Saves and hit points are improved as well. Take all spell/ song related feats as you level as Bard and aim to take the 3rd and 4th Paladin lvls at 6th and 9th lvls correspondingly. Try to max-out both your Strength and your Charisma, as so many of your abilities rely on the later. A very useful spell to cast in combat is \"War Cry\", that will give you both +2 AB/ +2 Dmg and may cause fear in your opponents. Wounding whispers are a \"must\" likewise, as is \"Improved invisibility\". Really there are too many \"buffs variables\" in this character and once you use them all she can reach astronomical values in both AB and Dmg.<br/>\n<br/>\n * If you like to buff before fights, then consider taking \"Extend Spell\" in place of \"Knockdown\", having both \"Still Spell\" and \"Extend Spell\" in your build adds immense flexibility for a Bard.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
