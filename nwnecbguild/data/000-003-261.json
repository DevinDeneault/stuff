      "content": "<div>I'm not very good with builds so I'm hoping you guys can help me with this one like you did once before!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>1) PvM or PvP - Builds that are maximized for PvM are often not maximized for dueling with other PCs</strong>.<br/>\n - Mostly for PvM as I play on a server that doesn't have a whole lot of PvP though if able I wouldn't complain with a build that would function well in both enviorments.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>2) Level cap - What is the maximum level that the build (or server) will likely reach?</strong><br/>\n - The level cap is 20<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>3) Race preference - Unless a class demands a specific race or races, Human will be assumed. Otherwise, specify the your favorite.</strong><br/>\n - I would love to go Dwarf for RP reasons but I understand the -2 CHA makes it a less than perfect choice. Human would be fine (Paladin will be part of the build)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>4) Class preference - Describe which class(es) you have been considering so far and why. Your own concept is key to building what will do the job and be the most fun for you to play.</strong><br/>\n .- Paladin/Champion of Torm/Rogue<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>5) Melee preference - A few options to consider are: dual-wielding vs. one-hand with shield, high AC dexterity-based vs. high-damage strength-based, sneak attacks (stealth), taunting, specialized attacks (e.g. whirlwind, knockdown, called shots, sneaks, death attacks... you name it!).</strong><br/>\n - Built to survive. The goal is to be able to hold the front line and allow others time to deal damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>6) Range preference - DEX archery or Zen Archery (WIS)</strong><br/>\n - Not concerned with Range.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>7) Weapon preference - Which weapon type would you enjoy using the most?</strong><br/>\n - I'm thinking Warhammer and shield?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>8) Maximum item enhancement - In the setting where you intend to play this character, what is the highest enchantment (or bonus) that is likely to be used on equipment?</strong><br/>\n - +3 weapons and armor. You can stack multiple + to stats. (ex.. I have a sorcerer that has 30 base CHA due to stacking items on this server)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>9) Spellcasting - If you are requesting a build that is likely to use magic, explain its general use</strong><br/>\n - With the Rogue levels and UMD I am not totally concerned with spell casting as I can use wands/scrolls for buffs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n The idea behind this guy is that he is a Front Line. The guy who makes sure everyone else leaves the battlefield with as few scratches as possible.I was looking for a build that is great for survival.. Thinking high saves, AC, and evasion. Dwarf and Paladin don't mesh perfectly I understand but I wanted to see if you guys thought it was possible to make work.<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

There are many good front-liners there including my \"Gate-Keeper\" and Mick's \"Brawler Champion\", or is it that you want specifically a Paladin-Rogue-Champion Of Torm?</div>"

      "content": "<div>You said you wanted a build made to survive disturbed, a build that will be able to hold the front lines no-matter-what, and if possible be a Dwarf for extra role-playing. With a full plate and shield, full tumble skill, improved expertise and divine shield on top of those \"<span style=\"color:#0000CD\"><strong>Rogue-Knight's</strong></span>\" AC, is as good as it gets. With Champion of Torm and Paladin bonusses to your saving throws you have no fear from enemy spell-casters, especially when you buff that charisma of yours. You are immune to fear and disease, and have lot's of hit points just in case that something goes wrong. If those aren't enough you have UMD in order to use the best scrolls and wands out there. And because being all-defensive is sometimes boring, i made sure you have all the bursts you might wanted, so you will be able to become an engine of destruction and show them \"how is done\". Divine might, Divine shield, Divine wrath, 3 Smites and your trusty warhammer should be enough for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:120%;line-height:normal\">THE ROGUE KNIGHT</span><br/>\n (Paladin 7/ Rogue 3/ COT 10)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>RACE: DWARF<br/>\n ALIGNMENT: Lawful Good<br/>\n PLAYABILITY: PvM 1-20<br/>\n<br/>\n STARTING/ ENDING STATS:</strong><br/>\n STR -\u00a0 16 (<strong>18</strong>)<br/>\n DEX -\u00a0 08<br/>\n CON - 16<br/>\n INT -\u00a0\u00a0 14<br/>\n WIS -\u00a0 08<br/>\n CHA - 13 (<strong>16</strong>)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hit Points: 264<br/>\n<br/>\n Skill Points: 134\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Disable Traps: 18 (20)<br/>\n Discipline: 23 (27)<br/>\n Search: 18 (20)<br/>\n Spellcraft: 8 (10) cc<br/>\n Spot: 22 (21)<br/>\n Tumble: 20 (19)<br/>\n UMD: 17 (20)<br/>\n<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fort/Ref/Will): 25/ 19/ 13 \u2192 29/ 23/ 17 (saves Vs spells)<br/>\n Buffed Charisma (Fort/Ref/Will): 31/ 25/ 19 --&gt; 35/ 29/ 23 (saves Vs spells)<br/>\n<br/>\n Naked/ Armoured AC: 13/ 24 (Full plate and Tower shield)<br/>\n Armoured AC with Divine Shield and IE: 45 (No-magic items)<br/>\n<br/>\n BAB: 19 (Four attacks)<br/>\n AB: +24/ +19/ +14/ +9 (Warhammer)<br/>\n DMG: 1D8 +4/ 19-20 x3 (Warhammer)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>LEVELING GUIDE</strong>:<br/>\n 01) Rogue (01): Power Attack<br/>\n 02) Paladin (01):<br/>\n 03) Paladin (02): Expertise<br/>\n 04) Paladin (03):<br/>\n 05) Paladin (04):<br/>\n 06) Paladin (05): Divine Might<br/>\n 07) Rogue (02):<br/>\n 08) Paladin (06):<br/>\n 09) Paladin (07): Divine Shield<br/>\n 10) Champion Of Torm (01):<br/>\n 11) Champion Of Torm (02): WF: Warhammer<br/>\n 12) Champion Of Torm (03): Knockdown<br/>\n 13) Champion Of Torm (04): IC: Warhammer<br/>\n 14) Champion Of Torm (05):<br/>\n 15) Champion Of Torm (06): Blind Fight, Extra Smiting<br/>\n 16) Champion Of Torm (07):<br/>\n 17) Rogue (03):<br/>\n 18) Champion Of Torm (08): Toughness, Improved Knockdown<br/>\n 19) Champion Of Torm (09):<br/>\n 20) Champion Of Torm (10): Improved Expertise\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>SPECIAL NOTES</strong>:<br/>\n * Divine Wrath: +5 attack/ +5 damage/ +5 to all saves/ damage reduction<br/>\n * Divine Might: 3 (9) Divine Damage<br/>\n * Divine Shield: 3 (9) Dodge AC<br/>\n * Smite Evil: 3/ Day for +3 (+9) Attack and +17 Damage<br/>\n * Lay on Hands: 51 (153) Positive Energy that Destroys Undead or Heals<br/>\n * Turn Undead: 6 (12) Uses/ Day<br/>\n * Immune to Disease<br/>\n * Immune to Fear<br/>\n * Evasion<br/>\n * Sneak Attack 2d6<br/>\n * Can wield the Holy Avenger sword<br/>\n * Can use all equipment (UMD)\u00a0</div>"
