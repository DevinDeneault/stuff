HP nearly 400. Skill points are awful, but not much one can do there as a half-orc cleric.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nDev Crit is obtained at level 24 and Dev Crit DC is 37. Could have increased the DC by 1 by taking a Great Strength but I preferred the extra AB for a +5% chance to hit and crit against comparable opponents.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause it is a dual strength/wisdom build, it has a reasonable melee presence as a secondary attack (Base AB 35), although other builds will be better at this, the cleric boosts to AB/AC can very much compensate except in high magic environments, and mean his morning star attack might still be useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpot is chosen over listen as the detection skill, not just because CoT has it as a class skill, but also because Spot is effective at all distances provided one is in visual range, whereas listen is <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Detect\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">less effective at longer distances</a>.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSpotting enemies doesn't incur the -4AB penalty without Blind Fight that would occur if a creature is detected with listen <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/spot-listen-blind-fight-and-ab-t2355285.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">that I discovered recently</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaves are surprisingly good.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso avoided exp penalties for essentially the entire build, which will make single player module users very happy!<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought this build draft looked pretty nice so I've decided to share it with you guys, see if there is anything to tear down and remake again in the spirit of continuous improvement.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Other build adjustments I have considered:</strong><br/>\nChoosing Darts as the weapon would save me having to take the Rapid Reload feat and allow for uncapped strength damage, however the critical range was poor so I didn't select this. Also ammunition tends to run out quick, and crossbow provides both the magical properties of the crossbow and the ammunition.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoint Blank Shot would have been nice, along with Blind Fight but I felt extend spell is more useful in this situation (ie extended divine favor, extended divine power etc etc).<br/>\n<br/>\nChose Animal / Plant domains for the stronger summons (which you can buff with Barkskin + Cat's Grace) to tank damage while you blast away. Travel / Trickery would also be delightful choices, if the environment permits this.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther single level class wonder choices instead of Monk included fighter (bonus feat), ranger (bonus feat), rogue/assassin (skills/1d6 sneak attack) but I thought Monk provided the most here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpellcraft would have been nice for some saves but it was tough to fit everything in.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Cleric(29), Monk(1), Champion of Torm(10), Half-Orc\n\nDEX: 8\nWIS: 16 (28)\nCHA: 6\nHalf-Orc: (Darkvision)\n02: Cleric(2)\n04: Cleric(4): STR+1, (STR=19)\n06: Cleric(6): Zen Archery\n08: Cleric(8): STR+1, (STR=20)\n10: Cleric(10)\n12: Cleric(12): STR+1, Improved Critical: Heavy Crossbow, (STR=21)\n14: Cleric(14)\n16: Champion of Torm(1): STR+1, (STR=22)\n18: Champion of Torm(3): Cleave, {Smite Evil}\n20: Champion of Torm(5): STR+1, (STR=23)\n22: Cleric(16)\n24: Champion of Torm(8): STR+1, Epic Weapon Focus: Heavy Crossbow, Devastating Critical: Heavy Crossbow, (STR=25)\n26: Cleric(18)\n28: Cleric(20): WIS+1, (WIS=18)\n30: Cleric(22): Great Wisdom II, (WIS=19)\n32: Cleric(24): WIS+1, (WIS=21)\n34: Cleric(26): Great Wisdom IV, (WIS=22)\n36: Cleric(28): WIS+1, Great Wisdom V, (WIS=24)\n38: Champion of Torm(9)\n40: Monk(1): WIS+1, {Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}, (WIS=28)\nHitpoints: 380\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 29/34/23\nBAB: 26\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 26/28\nAlignment Changes: 0\nConcentration 35(36), Disable Trap 1(2), Search 5(6), Set Trap 1(0), Spot 42(51), Tumble 40(39)\n\n02: Concentration(1), Save(2),\u00a0\n04: Concentration(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n06: Concentration(1), Save(6),\u00a0\n08: Concentration(1), Save(8),\u00a0\n10: Concentration(1), Save(12),\u00a0\n12: Concentration(1), Save(16),\u00a0\n14: Concentration(1), Save(20),\u00a0\n16: Spot(19), Save(6),\u00a0\n18: Spot(1), Save(10),\u00a0\n20: Spot(1), Save(14),\u00a0\n22: Concentration(7), Save(12),\u00a0\n24: Spot(1), Save(15),\u00a0\n26: Concentration(1), Save(17),\u00a0\n28: Concentration(1), Save(21),\u00a0\n30: Concentration(1), Save(25),\u00a0\n32: Concentration(1), Save(29),\u00a0\n34: Save(35),\u00a0\n36: Save(41),\u00a0\n38: Spot(14), Save(33),\u00a0\n40: Tumble(40),\u00a0\n</details></div>"

      "content": "<div>Thanks Zanithar and Mick for the comments<br/>\n<br/>\nI had forgotten about the extra attack from DP although a BAB 26+ has the advantage of preserving that extra attack in case you get Mord'ed, which in some environments, you will, and you will often! :) I might just leave it as is for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the comment on the earlier great wisdom feats, and I agree, they also increase AB anyway<br/>\n<br/>\nI liked Beory because it married well with the name and domains, however Monk gives a lot to the build in terms of survivability. Could possibly drop some caster levels to pump that up to Monk 3 at least for some monk speed but I'd probably stick that at the end in case players want to take this in a single player module and not have to put up with multiclass penalties.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe I can erm... complete my clerical training, then become lawful perhaps...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course Mick I had forgotten <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build303744.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">your double devastator build</a>\u00a0Fighter/Bard/AA, with my apologies!\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nNot sure why this isn't in the hall of fame?

      "content": "<div>All good comments, I just want to call out that Divine Power offers a full melee attack for the fourth attack rather than a partial melee attack \u201cIf\u201d applied to a sub 4 APR build.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the attack schedule for your build at 20th level (when APR is defined) would be:<br/>\n17/12/7/2 (from memory), add Divine power and it becomes: 20/15/10/5.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the 3APR build your attack schedule would be: 15/10/5 (at 20th level). Divine Power bumps you to 20/15/10/20.  There is some discussion on the value of a permanent 4 APR build vs the 3 APR plus Divine Power, but in my experience that full AB 4th attack is one of the most powerful abilities in the game and well worth  the occasional Mord\u2019s and re-application of Divine Power.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would strongly recommend testing it out so you can see the difference it makes on end game content.  Especially on a DevCrit build where it doubles down on power.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk</div>"

Decisions decisions. Time for a coffee I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway food for thought! Thanks for commenting. Maximillan Kane felt very strongly about this BAB 25 DP thing for clerics.

      "content": "<div>UPDATED: Adjusted UBAB schedule AB as per comments below.\u00a0 This changes offhand and free attack weapon schedules on UBAB attacks to BAB progression.\u00a0 I also added a reference to \"Main\", \"Off-hand\" and \"Free\" to the attack schedules described below as this term is used in some of the wiki examples to provided some additional clarity.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple of nuances here related to how this works. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, Divine power \"added attacks\" work in the same sequence calculation as haste, flurry, rapid shot, cleaves, attacks of opportunity and tensor. They all act as an attack using a \u201cthird\u201d hand. \u00a0We will come back to this in a second.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, Divine power converts all first, second and third hand attack sequences to that of an equivalent full melee BAB build subject to the +20 AB Cap.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I tend to focus on the level 20 sequences because everything is decided by then with respect to BAB and more importantly APR ... meaning nothing you do after level 20 outside of not levelling will impact your final BAB.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if you have. 16 vs 15 BAB at level 20 (I believe these are all accurate,

Sure.\u00a0 But it's not your only casting.\u00a0 If (when) I get Morded or Dispelled, that's the \"oh shite\" moment, so you hit your Greater Sanc button, and re-energize your energification (so not a word).\u00a0 I typically run around with at least 3 or 4 DPs memorized, with an Extended one or two in my backpocket for the boss.\u00a0 By level 20, your extended DP will last 32 rounds.\u00a0 Coupled with an Extended Haste (also 32 rounds), and Rapid Shot, Extended Divine Favors, and all of the other Buffs, and you'll be like a mini-gun mowing down tree lines.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!</div>"

Most module designs I recall allow for 3/4 builds to hit &amp; crit on their first attack. Estimate only, without doing the math.</div>"
