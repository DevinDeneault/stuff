However, if you go for a full 30 levels of Dwarven Defender you will automatically receive a further 7 Damage Reductions (1 each at levels 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26 and 30). So, technically, you can have 10 ranks of Damage Reduction, totalling DR of 30/-<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and welcome to the Guild!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",
