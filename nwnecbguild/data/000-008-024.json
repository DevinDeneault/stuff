Regent Torin of Khorsa and Emperor Hessek of Marduk declared an armistice, putting aside their latent enmity, to forge a peace accord that would bring prosperity to the two kingdoms. For many, this was a joyous occasion. However, this would not do for the Chaos Harbinger. He would offer these two kingdoms as grist for the wheel of time. In the beginning there was chaos, and in the end there would be chaos. All the unnatural order that man strove to create must be destroyed. That was his goal; that was the cause to which he had devoted his life. If he could disrupt the peace accords, the two empires would crash against each other and crumble, vanishing forever from the face of Faerun. Read more...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe war between good and evil has been fought for millennia, but another war of ideologies has been waged even longer. The war between order and chaos has been fought since the instant of creation, and like any war, it has its champions. The Chaos Harbinger is a champion of chaos, and ultimately, he knows he is fighting for his own destruction, but for some reason he has judged civilization and structure unworthy of existence and he pursues its destruction above all else.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleric(15), Fighter(8), Rogue(17), Human<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 16 (26)<br/>\nDEX: 10<br/>\nCON: 14<br/>\nWIS: 14 (18)<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\nNote:  A 20% XP penalty applies for levels 7, 8, 22-26 &amp; 30-40.

As a warrior against the forces of order, the Chaos Harbinger has become a master swordsman, capable of killing an opponent with one blow.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood AC for an armored character. The Harbinger recognizes the need for a good defense.<br/>\n10D6 Sneak Attack. Assassination is a tool of political change. The Harbinger uses assassination to plot the downfall of governments.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 8 Cleric Spells. His devotion to chaos has earned him the favour of the gods of chaos. He can draw upon their power to augment his abilities or smite an opponent with harm or word of faith (really nice with the sneak attack).<br/>\n<br/>\nHigh Use Magic Device. Mages often serve as advisors to kings and priests. The Harbinger has learned to duplicate their abilities to implicate them in his schemes.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan set and craft traps. Warriors of Chaos are an independent lot; they do not work well with others. As such, they must rely on other means to deal with large numbers of opponents.<br/>\n<br/>\nImproved Evasion. Though his saves are low, he will either take half damage or no damage against damage spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nChaos Harbinger Disadvantages<br/>\n<br/>\nLow saves. With the +8 from Spellcraft and some additional bonuses from cleric spells they're better, but a save-boosting item should be a priority for the Harbinger.<br/>\n<br/>\nLow AB. He only has a base AB of 38; the cleric buffs can raise it to 62. In a low magic world that should be plenty, but as magic items start getting more powerful this won't be enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nFavoured Spells<br/>\nLevel 0: Light, Resistance<br/>\nLevel 1: Bless, Divine Favour, Protection From Alignment, Sanctuary, Sheild of Faith<br/>\nLevel 2: Bull's Strength, Darkness, Endurance, Silence<br/>\nLevel 3: Darkfire, Invisibility Purge, Prayer, Magic Vestment, Negative Energy Protection<br/>\nLevel 4: Death Ward, Dismissal, Divine Power, Greater Magic Weapon<br/>\nLevel 5: True Seeing, Battletide, Circle of Doom, Improved Invisibility<br/>\nLevel 6: Harm, Heal, Greater Sanctuary<br/>\nLevel 7: Word of Faith, Aura of Vitality<br/>\nLevel 8: Aura vs. Alignment, Mass Heal<br/>\n<br/>\nMagic Item Wish-List<br/>\nImmunity to critical hits item. The Harbinger realizes the need for defense from rogues and warriors with Devastating Critical.<br/>\nSaving throw boosting item. This will give the Harbinger extra defense against magical attacks.<br/>\nAn item with haste or scrolls of haste.<br/>\nA powerful greatsword, preferably keen. With greater magic weapon and darkfire, he can turn a normal greatsword into a powerful weapon, but some extra power is always useful.<br/>\nAC boosting items. He has some AC buffing spells, but magical armor can exceed his abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nKEY STATS<br/>\n<br/>\nFinal Saves (vs. Spells)<br/>\nFortitude 25 (33)<br/>\nReflexes 19 (27)<br/>\nWill 24 (32)<br/>\n<br/>\nAB and Damage<br/>\nWith no buffs, regular greatsword:<br/>\n38/33/28/23 18+2D6 (+10D6 Sneak Attack) (17-20 x2)<br/>\nDevastating Critical DC 38 <br/>\nDarkfire, Greater Magic Weapon, Bull's Strength. Aura of Vitality, Divine Might, Divine Favor, War Domain Power, Battletide, Normal Greatsword)<br/>\n62/57/52/47 26+2D6 (+5 Magic) (+6-11 Fire) (+10D6 Sneak Attack) (17-20 x2)<br/>\nDevastating Critical DC 40<br/>\n<br/>\nAC<br/>\n26 (Normal full plate, no buffs)<br/>\n41 (Aura of Vitality, Sheild of Faith, Magical Vestments, Full Plate, Haste (rogue UMD))</div>"
