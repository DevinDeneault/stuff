Now I can see that the build I had chosen for Edwin wasn't appropriate for the character. In BG, he was a selfish, arrogant, obnoxious prick with enormous magical powers, dwarfed only by the size of his ego. He would constantly insult not only your character, but many of the travelling companions as well, and many NPCs would eventually attack him if they were in the same party for too long.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we know, the bastard was initially sent to assassinate Dynaheir. So, in terms of NWN, this means he NEEDS at least 1 level of Assassin in there, and he's also a very competent caster, so most of his levels should go to Wizard. And finally, to round up the build, he was a Conjurer. As much as I'd like to make him a conjurer in game, losing Transmutation spells (Time Stop, Haste) is totally out of the question. So in my mind, I did the next best thing: I gave him Spell Focus on the school AND I selected Druid as the 3rd class, which will allow his Summon Creature spells to summon a creature from a list 1 level higher. At least on WoG. that Druid level will allow him to do that. Otherwise, if where you play that's not the case, you can go Cleric, and choose the Animal domain. I went with Druid because you also get Animal Companion and more skill points, so it's a little better. Then, to further his focus in Conjuration, I also gave him both Epic Spells that summon creatures: Mummy Dust and Dragon Knight. In Vanilla NWN, these summons are really underwhelming, so feel free to swap these out for 2 Great Intelligence feats if you want. It's probably better even if they have been beefed up, but I just think it suits him, so I kept them.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, my first Dedicated Caster with Conjuration focus. Too bad the GOOD Conjuration spells that benefit from the Spell Focus feats are all low level... Oh well! I guess his Evard's will be VERY HARD to resist LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout further ado, Edwin Odesseiron!<br/>\n<br/>\nWizard(38), Druid(1), Assassin(1), Human<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 8<br/>\nDEX:

mentioned for those who are interested in using this build, is that there is a LOT of room for you to tweak him to suit your tastes. For example: If you want to include the Spell Penetration feats, you can drop 2 out of these 3 non-essential feats: Expertise, Luck of Heroes, or Great Fortitude for Spell Penetration and Greater Spell Penetration, then Mummy Dust or Dragon Knight for Epic Spell Penetration. You can also add a second school of focus the same way, if that's what you want to do. The same holds true for the Skills. If you think Edwin wouldn't set traps, then you can tweak the trap skills out and spend those points elsewhere. In a nutshell, there's plenty of room for you to make him yours!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what do you guys think?<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

For most of his life, the Pixie will be doing the \"dirty work\", as you have suggested, but when he gets access to trapping skills, he'll be wanting to recover them and use them against his enemies. Just yesterday I was adventuring with BlackCobra, using my Subtle Death build (Ranger 15 / Assassin 23 / SD 1), and he was recovering traps with a DC of 58 (48 to Disable), so I know that works on WoG.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout Druid and/or Cleric, you're right if you look at it from this perspective (Druids being Neutral nature-oriented characters, or Clerics worshipping gods), then I agree it wouldn't be much akin to his character. However, if you look at it from a different perspective, of him trying to find ways to enhance his magical powers by pretending to do something until he \"gets what he wants\", then IMO it'd work. And when you're making an adaptation of a character, something has to give. Even if by a NWN restriction I have to START as Lawful Neutral to qualify for Druid, I can still RP him as Evil in modules where your decisions shift your alignment, and he would definitely \"end up\" being LE by the end of his career. Or if there are no Alignment Shifts, I can start with Neutral Evil just to meet the requirements for all classes and see this as a NWN limitation that needs to be circumvented. Or, as you suggested, I could go with Cleric instead and be Lawful Evil as the original character is.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know, I wanted to get as many skill points as possible when I built him, so that's why I started with Druid. Of course, by the end of the build, I had 16 \"extra\" skill points that went into Heal, but I didn't go back to the start, mostly because I didn't really feel like there was any other stat that I could invest those points in that would matter. I guess STR for carrying capacity could help out early on, but after he starts getting his Bags of Holding (and he will have about 100 of them), it won't matter anymore. DEX would give him a bit of AC, but it wouldn't make him any less hittable or vulnerable to physical attacks than he is already. I'm curious, where would you spend these points? Would you boost STR or DEX (or something else)? Just to clarify, I decided against it because early on, he can use his Druid spells for extra summons, then later he can use them to cast Grease. Even though the DCs wouldn't be competitive with only 12 Wisdom, they can be used to bait dispels from enemies. Imagine a high level mage using up his Mord's to clear a Grease spell from your level 1 Druid slot?! That's awesome! I know it's a bit powergamey, but that's what we're all about! LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess it depends on how \"hardcore\" one wants to be with the character concept for adaptations between different systems and what are the aspects of the character that are more relevant to each one of us. Coming up with a build for Yoshimo in NWN is the PERFECT example of this problem. In BG, he dual-wielded Katanas, which in NWN you can't do without receiving a severe AB penalty. I would also think that he's a DEX toon, but then Katanas can't be finessed either. So, what would you change? @Stagmeister and I are currently working on 2 different builds for him. The first one is a STR-based single-Katana Fighter, which\u00a0 I made, and the second one is a DEX-based dual-Kukri Fighter, which Stag is working on. Not giving spoilers on the classes we're using, but the question remains: \"what gives?\"<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the feedback! Your suggestions are certainly viable to those who want to remain true-er to his character!\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Just for further clarification. The Find Traps spell on WoG, has been altered to find traps, but not disarm them. So, on WoG, this character would be able to detect the traps with his wand of Find Traps, then recover them using his skills.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
