      "content": "<div>Hi all ECBers<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was an interesting idea I brewed with my morning coffee...<br/>\n<br/>\nKensai Druid (focused in Scimitar, which Druid has a proficiency in)<br/>\n<br/>\nAC boosted by his high Wisdom score, uber buffed by Owl's Insight<br/>\n<br/>\nLater on this one can turn into a Dragon!<br/>\n<br/>\nBase AB is 37 which is decent for a 'Spellsword', I have been thinking in my mind of ways to try to get that higher with no success. I wasn't willing to dump Cons any further 400hp odd is pretty important for a dedicated melee'er, and I think this chappy will be a tank with all that wisdom AC<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway fingers crossed the druidic disables plus other goodies like Bull's Strength / Blood Frenzy etc etc can buff up the stats high enough to give em a good whack<br/>\n<br/>\nBuffs are dispellable atm, I could drop the AB by a few more points (by going a Druid 25 / WM 13 / Monk 2 split) to make em undispellable but I thought that might hurt this chaps combat prowess, also he misses out on useful bonus combat feats (ie EWF/EP/AS) which would hurt the AB even more<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do I care about the AB if the build has polymorph? Just because I found it annoying to kill 'little dudes' later on with my first close to pure druid playthrough, I'd have to blow big spells like finger / stonehold, change to dragon shape limited to 3x/day and one has to shift back whenever one meets a doorway, or spend an eternity trying to hit em in Water Elemental form. At least with an AB of 37 I figured I might be able to use that scimitar to chop up the little dudes and save the dragon shape for the big bosses<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Uber Powergamer aiming for maximal level 40 power will probably want to go for a Druid 20 WM 19 Monk 1 split with a single monk level tumble dump at 37 but I thought that would hurt play-ability excessively during the leveling<br/>\n<br/>\nI've pumped up stealth so this robed guy can kind of play like a scout with Druid's True Sight spell<br/>\n<br/>\nHehe stealth into a mob -&gt; 'suddenly a dragon with 8 APR (with flurry &amp; haste)\u00a0 and DR 40/+6 / 60-70AC / 900 odd HP / Evasion just appears!'<br/>\n<br/>\nNo UMD and a bit feat starved. Improved Knockdown, Zen Archery or Toughness would have been nice.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Druid(19), Weapon Master(19), Monk(2), Human\nSTR: 14\nCON: 12\nINT: 13\n\n01: Druid(1): Expertise, Dodge\n03: Druid(3): Weapon Focus: Scimitar\n05: Druid(5)\n07: Druid(7)\n09: Druid(9): Spring Attack\n11: Druid(11)\n13: Weapon Master(1): Weapon of Choice: Scimitar\n15: Weapon Master(3): Blind Fight\n17: Weapon Master(5)\n19: Weapon Master(7)\n21: Druid(13): Improved Critical: Scimitar\n23: Druid(14)\n25: Druid(16)\n27: Weapon Master(9): Great Wisdom II, (WIS=24)\n29: Weapon Master(11)\n31: Weapon Master(13): Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar\n33: Weapon Master(15): Great Wisdom IV, (WIS=28)\n35: Weapon Master(17)\n37: Monk(2): {Deflect Arrows}\n39: Druid(19): Dragon Shape\n\nSkillpoints: 220\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +2, Fear: +2\nAB (max, naked): 37 (melee), 30 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Druid(9)\n\n\n01: Concentration(4), Intimidate(2), Open Lock(1), Search(2), Spellcraft(1), Save(9),\u00a0\n03: Intimidate(1), Search(1), Save(16),\u00a0\n05: Intimidate(1), Search(1), Save(24),\u00a0\n07: Search(1), Save(34),\u00a0\n09: Search(1), Save(44),\u00a0\n11: Search(1), Save(54),\u00a0\n13: Discipline(16), Search(1), Save(46),\u00a0\n15: Discipline(1), Search(1), Save(50),\u00a0\n17: Discipline(1), Save(56),\u00a0\n19: Discipline(1), Save(62),\u00a0\n21: Save(71),\u00a0\n23: Save(6),\u00a0\n25: Save(18),\u00a0\n27: Discipline(5), Listen(10), Save(13),\u00a0\n29: Discipline(1), Save(19),\u00a0\n31: Discipline(1), Save(25),\u00a0\n33: Discipline(1), Save(31),\u00a0\n35: Discipline(1), Save(37),\u00a0\n37: Discipline(1), Hide(15), Move Silently(15), Tumble(15),\u00a0\n39: Spellcraft(2), Save(4),\u00a0</details></div>"
