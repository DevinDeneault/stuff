You start out at level 17 or so, I think.\u00a0 I recall hitting level 40 before the end of the final chapter. It never gets too easy or too hard, to my recollection.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour party arrives back at your master's to find that he has been murdered. So you set out to solve the mystery and get vengeance.\u00a0 But there are plots afoot, at the highest levels . . .<br/>\n<br/>\nI've played all or most of the other modules mentioned here (Saleron's Gambit did not work properly for me (game stopping bug of some sort); and I'm currently in Chapt 2 of Swordflight) but didn't see MTS listed. Some unique magic items and locations.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a few other decent epic mods, will have to check when I get home.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">This isn't posted yet in the \"Modules\" section because i intent to do a full review of the series but, has anyone looked or played throught the HoF modules\u00a0MTS1 - The Mines of Twin Summit, MTS2 - The War of the Fallen &amp; MTS3 - The Final Sunset by Q?<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause i did and man, what an epic saga it has been! I think that here we have a direct opponent of the \"Sands of Fate series\". Perhaps it isn't known widely because the author intended for this to be played by a <em><strong>full party of 3</strong></em>, propably in LAN, but i tried it solo with a pre-gen character it was provided in the module and finished it successfully. And yes, it is difficult, more so than \"Sands of Fate\" by far, but it can be done.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou start the module with a character at 15th level with good equipment and proceed from there, which makes it ideal for a character that just finished the Original campaign. You might be a couple of levels more than requested but we are talking solo here, so you need that slight edge in the beginning. The first module in the series <em><strong>does not require CEP but the other two Does.\u00a0 </strong></em><br/>\n<br/>\nThe story is...Well it can't be more Epic in scope than that, trust me on this. The leveling is fast and you can expect to reach about 34th level at the end of the 2nd module with the 3rd taking you to the full 40th.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my question is this, has anyone tried this series of modules? Did you know about them? What are your experiences &amp; how did you find them in play?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">In this the author replied in the old Vault, in the comments that he felt a henchman would be inadequate for this modules. The combat is challenging so you have to make use of \"pulling\" techniques and heavy use of LoS (Line of Sight) in many cases. To be fair though the author made these modules before Tony's A.I which enables a much better control of henchmen was a factor in single player's experience, so by then we only had Pausanias A.I (if i remember the name correctly) and that was not so well-known by that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo instead of having a henchman that dies all the time the author simply chose not to incorporate them into the module at all. In my opinion he should have done this and just give the player's the choice of take them or not. But alas...<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain from the old Vault's comments section one can gather that some players back then did incorporate henchmen into the module making use of the \"Module Builder's Henchman Kit\" a utility that basicaly allows you to make your own henchmen. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat i think, is that you take a fully decked-out character from the end of the Original campaign, around 17th level and you play the module and see for yourself if you can do it. The author apparently did have a schedule to polish his modules even more but that didn't happen for some reason -perhaps RL issues, like many others.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">So, i went on and re-played the first module in the series with a 15th level character this time one of my own. Nothing special just a pure fighter with no special equipment, but its important to start with at least a +3 weapon (the pre-gens had +4's) and in my opinion a good AC of at least 35. Most important feats are in order: Knockdown, Power-attack &amp; Expertise, as usual really. Knockdown will prove very useful throughout the series, even the simple version of it, so you better have it if you play a melee character. A ranged weapon (doesn't have to be something special, a plain composite +3 bow or the equivalent will suffice) will prove useful as well to seperate big mobs from their leaders.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to say the module's creator did a pretty good job with the rewards that you get from your fallen opponents and in other cases the items that are crafted for you by certain individuals. At the start it might seem that this is a high magic \"maunty haul\" type of module but it isn't to my big surprise, and the overall magic level is well below the HoTU's levels, which i find it extreme and tends to destroy the sense of challenge. Almost all of the named enemies have their own unique items that you get to loot after you defeat them and they cover a wide variety of arms &amp; armour with the occasional finds for mages &amp; clerics. Some of you will be happy to hear that special care has been taken so that Monks do not feel under-equipped, as there is a plethora of magic items to find for them, and that is even more apparent in the sequels. The creator of the module also appears to have a knack for the eastern-themed cultures so samurai's and katana's lovers won't regret it for sure!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing that doesn't seem much in the beginning is the story &amp; the background in general. You start as a mercenary that travels to the lowly town of Twin-Summits but your caravan get attacked en-route and your team are the only survivors of that attack (the module most of the time, assumes you are a team in conversations). With your friend &amp; mentor killed and without an alternative to go in the midst of winter, you set on an adventure to find the murderers and take revenge. Right away you notice though that things aren't so simple and greater evils lurks behind, namely the two foreign dragons that took an interest on Twin-Summits some time ago because of its mithril mines. There is also the rumour that the ruins of an ancient elven civilization lies underneath the town... Can you find the connection between the two? Who is really Lord Shin and what are his connections with the blue dragon Shael and the Divine? Most importantly who is that mysterious mage locked aways by his own volition in the dungeons of the militia's HQ? <br/>\n<br/>\nBelow are some screenshots from throughout the trilogy, i hope you like them.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The blurb that goes with it suggests that this should supercede the necessity for CEP 1, except for \"older modules\". I find this a ludicrous statement, because at no point does it say what constitutes \"older\". Older than when?<br/>\n<br/>\nMy hesitance is because of the monumental crashings and loss of everything NwN-related when I first loaded the Aribeth's Redemption (Part 3) CEP package, so I just need some reassurance that my loading a CEP 1 won't knacker everything I've got using CEP 2.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this is the boring end of the spectrum, but further assurance/advice would be welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">It's my fault i didn't explained this better, let's do this properly now...<br/>\n<br/>\nNormally you are right Stag, that since you have a newer version of the CEP (2.60) you do not need an older one. That is correct, except from the fact that this is true from version 2.00 and after. For the old modules the authors used the 1.XX versions of CEP that the newer stuff won't cover. This is the case with both Diablo-Lord of Terror &amp; MTS Trilogy. The authors used 1.XX CEP to build their modules (the only one available at the time) so you need the installer for 1.XX CEP. Now this does not interfare with any newer versions of CEP 2.XX and later. It is installed seperately and works that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you have to use a CEP installer for 1.XX version, there are two installers like this. The first one is this: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/hakpak/combined/cep-v1x-installer\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://neverwintervault.org/project/nw ... -installer</a><br/>\nBut with this version you also need to download a little seperate fix that updates the cloaks to 1.69 patch, the installer you see covers everything but up to the 1.68 version of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe version i linked to you in the previous post however it is already patched to 1.69 and it is also recommended from the module's page. It is supposed to be the most recent version for ALL the old CEP modules. Now, take notice that i do not use that version since i have already installed the old one (with the fix applied) and i also use other utilities like Cloak Converter and so on, but this is not essential for you and i don't wantr to confuse you with additional stuff (one step at a time). That is why i linked the newer CEP installer and it should work like a charm.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope that covers up everything, have fun ;)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

And i sat down last night and made both a \"Musashi\" style Human Warrior &amp; his Dwarven brother with WarAxes.<br/>\nThat trick required tons of feats because i don't like to leave out the good stuff like Improved Knockdown OR Blind Fighting and i also had to maintain a good AB becasue of the (-4) to AB penalty for wielding two big weapons simultaneously, but it came out nicely i believe. I might begin anew with one of those toons in my arsenal ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are interested in the build just say so and i will present it (althought the ancient* ones -pan indented- might have already figure it out already).<br/>\nThe EDR 3 DD is already modernized i believe when we did the re-loaded \"Dwarven Wall\".<br/>\n<br/>\n* You will figure out what i am refering to by the third module, be patient...<br/>\n<br/>\nI will end the post with a nice screenshot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Necropolis of the Dead.

I laughed so hard when she started hitting me and scored crit-after-crit leaving me no room to breathe, much like to fight back, i was too busy drinking full heals to do anything else! I suspect if i had TonyK's AI this wouldn't even be permittable since she would KD the heck out of me leading to my early demise no doubt. This was the first time i saw in a module what a fully-fledged Weapon's Master can do to a normal character. Thankfully i had a helmet that prevents critical hits in my inventory and that solved the problem, allowing me to wear her down eventually...<br/>\n<br/>\nFor sure we are used to hard-core when playing in PW's like WoG but this was a first for a module, especially one that is build so early. I think \"Lord of Terror\" came close to that in certain fights but nothing so brutal in one-to-one scenarios. And of course i liked her transformation at the end, to prolong the fight, it is a trick that the author uses a lot in the third module to make battles feel Epic, since most of what you face in it, is a God or similar power creature. I have to say that i really enjoyed the fights in this trilogy!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It came from a build request I made in my very early days. I'd written it down the old-fashioned way - with pencil and paper - but have had a scan through the Build Request sub-forum and found it. If you're interested, it's on page 10 of that forum, and the thread is entitled \"<strong>Singing Monk, with maybe some dragon blood</strong>\". I posted the request on December 22 2014, originally looking for a Monk/Bard, to which Mick, Empyre and your good self rightly put a swift end. Empyre then offered up 2 lovely STR-based variations of Order of the Wyrm: one unarmed, one dual-wielding kamas. I've used both, and both are favourites of mine (including a non-Dev Crit version modified for Aielund). I'm afraid I did muck about a bit with the order I took some of the feats, but it's still true to those builds. I thought I go unarmed for this trip, unless you'd advise otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've left the Brawler in Luskan. Having reached the pinnacle of the Host Tower, I suddenly realised that I'd forgotten about Illusk in my hurry to complete the campaign, so had to do a reload. I left him at level 13 (F7/M1/CoT5). I will go back to the build, though, but if I'm going to bring it to these modules I might go for different weapon focuses, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Anyway the sad news is that you will eventually have to confront both of the dragons and Zael (for short) is the easiest path and the one you should follow first. You will notice immediatelly that you are into the correct area from the Frost Giants that are there. The mines is also an area you should do before Kor. Speak to the dwarves, it might take a while to find the correct people but they will give you a couple of quests and even open their shop for you. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow is your Monk fare so far?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I've just cleaned out the first 2 levels of Fire Giants on my way to Khor, so I might as well just finish this off before going after Zael. I'm on good terms with the dwarves and can go shopping with them (not that it's very helpful for my Monk, but I'm getting a good price for my loot from them so that's alright), having liberated their kin from the minotaurs and done the mine quest - although I haven't yet gone to the abandoned mine. I've also completed the sewers (except for the teleport to the Lab), and while doing so found myself popping into the Winter Wolf cellar, so I cleared the werewolves out quite thoroughly. Successfully dealt with the jeweller for the Dartmoths, so I can now buy stuff from Uther as well. That said, I've yet to replace any of the gear I arrived in - the only stuff that might appeal is a nice robe available from the monks, but I'd need to find some speedy boots first, and even then I'd have to balance it against the loss of my +5 Sun Soul boots - I need to do the sums first. Currently at level 22 - Monk 16/Sorc 1/RDD 5, he's going very well thank you - though the Fire Giant archers and snipers gave me a bit of a surprise at first (a nice touch, varying weapon types), so rapid belt swapping became useful once more, as did drawing the meleers away.<br/>\n<br/>\n@ Empyre: I just checked, and you're right about those scimitars.

Same again - lots of screens but different nasties. Now I've just said my goodbyes to the Master of the Damned, and been presented with another doorway, so I'm not sure - does my completion of one cave's interior and subsequent environs preclude me from finishing the other?

But after I went to present the Grand Master with Shin's head she told me (effectively) not to waste her time and go kill some dead things. My guess is that if you do Zael and Shin first you should be ok, because there are no zombies doing naughty things at that time, as you've only retrieved one head. At least, that's what I'll be doing next time I'm there and feeling monky.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Just a thought, now. In the 3rd module I've largely been flying by the seat of my pants, but I'm wondering who folk got to be their \"sponsors\"? I've currently got 3 (you need 10 before you can go all apocalyptic on your target's ass) - the Fae, the Wandering God and Death - and am working towards another 3 (the Moon, Music and Earth). Largely, this has been down to either advice from the Laughing God or Nicademus, or what I'm looking for to get a nice dress, which is why I'm in the realm of the Destroyer (Change) atm. I think it could be interesting to share who we got to side with us, but feel free to disagree...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Making a fair bit of progress in the 3rd module atm. I've got 8 supporters (Fae, Death, Travelling, Moon, Fire and Water, together with Humour and Change). I'm afraid I've only found a couple of the 7 notes for Music so far (3 and 4), but I'm not losing sleep over that, and I might get a deal with Earth.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a little concerned that I didn't encounter any prismatic dragons in the Destroyer's realm, just lots of clockwork stuff (including a dragon), and no prismatic thread (which I need for Zael's robe) That said, the screen with the fountain of change had absolutely nothing in it, and the fountain itself doesn't give me any options to do anything. Hmm.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, this is mostly about a tip. I'd already hit level 40 before going to Neptune's realm, but, having done his task, I decided to go for a wander (it's not often you get to travel underwater, after all). The western cave is a necropolis of the drowned (Valerfor gave us a screenshot earlier in this thread), and if you want to farm xp, that's the very place. It does help if you've got full immunity to negative energy, but regardless, I'm only two thirds of the way around the first screen and have gleaned over 30k xp, which is nice - or would be if I needed it. Still, I'm trying to be thorough!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnnoyingly, though, I'd been looking quiet cool in my gear until I got the Sultan's robes (Fiery War), but I couldn't not wear them - they're as good protection as anything else I've got, but also give me chaos shield on hit, which is hard to turn down, even though I now look like a speedy green lampshade!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That is why the God of Humor tells you in the beginning to start your journey first by visiting all the available Gods and see what they want from you before you get into the different planets. You also need to visit the God of the forge right away...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Prismatic Dragon is in one of the connected (via a road) areas to the left or the right of the main Destroyer's realm. There are three roads, the one straight ahead takes you to the gnomes and then the other two have different areas attached to them. In one of those areas there is nothing but the Prismatic Dragon that drops some awesome loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the little dragon, as you can see the are is very...colourful?<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8JNgLrG.jpg\" /><br/>\nAnd if you dont like at some point the clothes you get as loot, all it takes is that little utility called \"Character Customizer\" from the Vault. You just drop the files in your Override folder and then it works in all modules automatically. It doesnt mess with anything else, so it is pretty safe. Here is an example of me using it with Doofy on the second module, as you can see it works like a charm.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoofy dressed-up like a real Barbarian (even though he is still wearing plate armour).

I have what I need from the god, but I'm still struggling to find the entrance. I went back to the Oasis of Tides and tracked everywhere to the east (fungus land), and nothing. Then I backtracked to the main Oasis and went north (Kua-Toas) - straight ahead - and still can't find a portal. It's the only thing I've got left to do before the final assault, which narks me a bit, but sod it. So, I've got 15 on board, with 1 unable to support me by reason of death, 3 not concluded (Music, the Forge, and the Iron Wind), and 1 my final target. I reckon I'll have a crack at it now. I'll let you know how it goes!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Colossally pissed off now. On my way back out of the Oasis of Tides I noticed a <em>southern </em>cave for the first time (so much for the diary entry saying eastern), and in I went...and behold - the Many! Cleared it all nice and easy, but now the portal from the lower level won't let me back out. Oh, I do love a glitch. So it appears I can either stop here or reload before I went there and fulfil my final quest. These things are sent to try us...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

He is in the 2nd &amp; 3rd modules though, not in the first one if i remember correctly, maybe Stag knows the answer better cause all this is more fresh in his memory. Good luck in your adventures!<br/>\n<br/>\nFor anyone that is up to a challenge, try to make your next play-through in such a way as to have the final battle going againt both gods! The author said that he never made it against both of them at the same time. (simply do not kill her before going to the last battle and she will be there).

Two sword saints you presented to us that might fulfil your requirements are the Whirlwind of Steel (Monk 25/Fighter 8/ WM7) and Raigeki - the Lightning Strike (Monk 20/ Fighter 4/ WM16). As a sideways twist - as in, there's no Monk - one of your builds I've always enjoyed is the Dodji Domotai (Fighter 16/ WM7/ Rogue 17).<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll have to come back to other posts later - just got back from RL - so need to refresh my memory!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Just had a dangerous thought...how about if you take the Whirlwind or Raigeki, I'll take the other one and we'll see how we get on? And yes, I'm including a final battle royal with both the gods in that. Might be a dumb idea, but also might be interesting to see how things develop. Anyway, I'll leave the thought with you...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I was taking a severe beating in the Thunder Goddess' realm until I remembered I had some protection against electricity tucked away in a bag, then all was fine. Equally, but from an offensive stance, when fighting those horrid things in the realm of Unlife it took me a while to realise that divine damage wasn't working and slipping on my acid-damaging gloves instead. I also struggled with the sheer volume of baddies in the the realm of Deception - and their speed. Fortunately, I was even speedier, even though the whole experience was the only time that breaking the Great Cleave cycle became a problem, in that it became hard work to break away in order to draw breath and recover a little. The only place I actually died (3 times in all) was in the cavern in the realm of the Forge (where I got the screenshot of the Emerald Juggernaut), when I failed a save against petrification. I my naivety, I had thought being immune to paralysis would cover that eventuality, but it did not. On reflection, if I had thrown on my Greater Brawler's Belt, I could have weathered the storm until the petrification wore off, but that's only just crossed my mind as I type this now.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in all honesty, most of my problems were in dealing with mobs, rather than bosses.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Went straight to the frost giants and got that sweet moss covered cloak, the frost giant berserkers i had to manipulate a bit with good positioning (choke points) but the rest were not a trouble at all. Slayed their champions, berserkers and finally king gaining a couple of levels in the process. Gained a new Greatsword as well (Avalance) that does nice cold damage. Then moved on to Zael's peak and since i wasn't having much trouble i went inside her fortress. Huge area, lots of golems, elementals and repeated encounters that made me yawn a bit, and i laughed a lot when i saw the samurai wannabe younf apprentices of Shin wielding dual kukris ;) I guess only the boss get to wield the real stuff (and somebody didn't tell him he\u00a0 gets -4/-4 too). By that point i got another level then another and jumped to epics gaining both ewf &amp; ews in Greatsword at 21st lvl and things progressed evene more smoothly from that point and on. Killed Zael once then went to her inner sanctum and faced both of them at the same time, they were no mach for the Greatsword. Lord Shin tried a lot and dealt some nice criticals but i drink a heal pot (the first) and smaked him down to his backside, then he never got up again, a double critical finished him for good. Looted all the stuff i cared for, all six bags of holding were full by that point but i continued to the portal, entered the thunder tower, crit for a hundred each sorceres in the process killing them instantly and then went straight to the sewers to find Uther.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sewers were\u00a0 nothing like i remembered, the gelatine cubes could not hit my \"touch AC\" for those that don't know what that is, let's just say that Monk's AC is applied in full to almost everything that has an attack roll, while a normal fighter with armour does not get the benefits of his armour while being attacked by a \"touch\" attack, like a bolt attack with acid etc. I cleared the sewers in less than three minutes then entered Uther's base and did both of his assassination quests to gain entry to white fox society and i stopped there for the night being level 24 at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe speed that girl clears encounters is closed to ludicrous, any weapon master can do close to that of course but the combination of two-handed sword plus big strength plus monk speed makes it fly. I will let things here for the moment and continue another night, uploading some screenshots as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nHave a good night everyone.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Morde Khan himself proved no challenge, he died on the first flurry from a double critical from the Greatsword dealing somewhat north of 200's points of damage. I did however forced to drink a second heal when i found myself in the midst of 20-something rakhasa's where they started (all of them) melf's &amp; magic missile me, so lesson learned, being too reckless is not good, unfortunately the Monk's speed doesn't help with restraining myself...<br/>\n<br/>\nNow is Khor's time but before that a little side-quest to the mines to find the maps and then free the dwarves from the Minotaurs. All went smoothly and in quick fashion so nothing new to report here since those are early quests that i did late (because i went to frost giants first to get the Avalance greatsword and the Moss-covered cloak). Alright, fire giant citadel then or is it citadel of fire? I forgot which and the names are pretty similar but i did both quickly and had great fun chopping down giants of all kinds fire. One particular fight was of special interest, Seo against six-seven petrify monsters with wings, Seo landed in the midst of the pack, they started breathing immediately, Seo made all her saves but they did not, so she was chopping down monster statues after that ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen it's Khor's sanctum at last, all five bad guys at once come at her, can't KD Khor, they hit hard so i had to drink a third one, quickly retreat with monk-speed down to the corridor and then beat them one by one without problems. Khor's might be immune to KD in his human form but the Dragon is not! so he didnt even get up from the ground, neither heal himself, just died a shameful death at the hands of Seo. Again too much loot, so i had to visit the Dwarves and sell before i get to the mage this time and deliver the heads of both dragons. He is a nice dude, friendly and all, oh he is a vampire by the way but a peaceful one! So, what the heck, i let him live and go wonder about the planes in search of knowledge while i am being occupied by more important matters. The town's guards are inept so i lend them a hand in order to dispach the zombies and then i go finish-up Ruthgard which had become a nice death knight himself killing the dwarf before i arrive. The counselor's weapon was a Hammer of Thunderbolts, so i wonder how did he lost with such a weapon in his hands...<br/>\n<br/>\nDown the mines i go and beyond the mithril door to chase Malphaedor and yeah i have to get all four seals before that. In the name of a greater purpose i slew all four of them but alignment remained the same, i guess it is because of that\u00a0 \"Dispach\" word they say before they judge you worthy or not. Sorry king Leoric but i need your Greatsword way more than you do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/M9VWqlE.jpg\" /><br/>\nWith her new sword Seo, becomes a real hunter now! Shortly thereafter i attain my 27th lvl and Devastating Critical comes with it, yay!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now Seo enters the inner sanctum of Malphaedor which is guarded by the twin Draco-Liches. That's a tough fight, i cannot KD them and they hit frequently even my 47 AC and hit hard even through the damage reduction offered by the Moss-covered cloak, but it's nothing she can't handle merely a tougher fight from the cake-walk she had till now. That fight made her drink twice more, i am afraid she might be a bit tipsy by that point ;) And then...the source of evil himself, Malphaedor! He offers me a deal that sounds too good to be true, Seo wasn't interested anyway so she destroyed him for good then little butterfly appears then her father, the plot thickens and i am ready to sleep, so i will leave this for another time, but i had lots of fun in the process, i hope you did as well, reading this long tale :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI will leave with a screenshot of the power-girls,<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/O9Hb6tq.jpg\" /><br/>\n<br/>\nUntil next time!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Aye, Deception it was, and yes, there was a really good robe (probably the best in the entire game for a Monk* - Zael's is designed for a Mage or Sorcerer, and I had 1 level of Sorcerer before - to access RDD - so no, I didn't have UMD). The deception robe (Robe of the Unseelie) gives AC+12, immunities to KD, crits and cold, haste and freedom, and for us, this time, a redundant spell resistance of 26. It's useable by Monk, Assassin, Druid, SD, Wiz and Sorcerer.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd thank the gods we're being sword saints, because she's also got the best gloves in the game, too. They're the ones (Grasp of Deception) with 2d12 magic <strong>and</strong> divine damage, AB+12, as well as +12 to CHA and DEX and on hit Confusion DC26 50%/2 rounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlimey, we're in for a big last fight!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and yes, I brought 6 bags with me, and have since bought 3 more from the Artificer.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight, when I've had a sleep it'll be helping the dwarves, then frostie the snowmen and Zael.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Just had a thought - depending on alignment, I guess, the Wandering God might have better ones. I won't be finding out this time around, however.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Sorry, forgot - there <em>is</em> a better robe, but you don't get it until <em>after</em> the final fight.

So I wondered (after saving) whether, given later events, maybe I should attack them. So I did, and the world and its brother went hostile on me. Which was a shame in many respects...the head of the monk society had robes I wasn't allowed to identify (wearing a ring of scholars and supping a potion of lore) - and with all merchants hostile, they wouldn't help, so it was probably good gear. I do know her gloves were +5 AB, with 1xd10 blunt damage, but hey-ho.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of which brings me round to saying that I'm now off to play with the fiery folk - and I guess Avalanche will help there.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and just turned level 25 (Monk 10/ Fighter 8/ WM 7) - and man, is she fun to play!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Probably more than the third module even if we compare them both as pure hack &amp; slash experience. Seo didn't have any noticable difficulties with any of the enemies and even the Death's avatar (the one with the scythe) ended quickly when i draw him alone and constantly put his bottom on the ground with consequent knockdowns. He never have the time to actually cast any of his 7 heals &amp; 7 harms like he did on my previous run with Duffy (big dumb barbarian didn't know what knockdown is, thought it was a new type of soap and he evade it like hell). I agree though that when you are used to deal so much damage - so quickly, when you run into crit-immune enemies like those you described Stag, it feels like you are slowing down, even though you still deal about 250-300 dmg / round. Seo got petrified once by those scarecrows/ lanterns and i had to load a save but other that that? Well, it was a Dev-Crit-Fest! I am wondering what would happen if we got a keen sword before chapter 3...And to think i didn't even have my strength maxed-out before the end of chapter 2...So, now Seo awaits patiently Ren to join her into the waterfalls before they once again launch into this epic adventure to dethrone not One but Two Gods that dared to mess with the wrong people!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some more screenshots from the second module, i hope you like them.<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/38n8dII.jpg\" /><br/>\nTahkisis battle proved to be, rather dissapointing this time...

I already did Dino-land and the Yuan-Ti leader and am using that Greatsword. The reason I went for Destruga's realm was because the Moon Goddess won't come on side until I've spoken with my sponsor and I need some material from there for the Forge, so I thought I'd be tidy. I did manage to clear that first golem screen with extensive use of Hide and Move Silently to pull the big beasts away one at a time, but I'll come back later for the rest.

A \"mysterious voice\" will say something about a hum of power, and when you're a bit closer a convo screen pops up inviting you to retrieve the note. The way I'm doing it is to go for a leisurely stroll around an area after I've cleared it.\n</details>I'll keep you updated as and when I find any more.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Now I'll taint those warm sentiments by saying, \"you ratbag!\" I don't know about Valerfor, but I was holding onto the belief that no one had been audacious enough to take on both baddies at the end, and that was one of the reasons for this current run-through. But paint me pink and call me Susan, you've only gone and done it yourself! In all sincerity, though, I'm hugely impressed, mate.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, you say you didn't have time to gain many of the gods' support, so who did you manage to get? You must have got at least 10 for Fate to allow the confrontation (making her the 11th), and that had to include the Moon, and therefore Destruga. Now, you get Humour for free, and I'll guess that you saved Persephone in Part 2, so the Wandering God was also in. Having got the weapon from the Forge, he must have been another, and if you'd got all the pieces for Shin, then at least 3 more, including Neptune and - iirc - the Iron Wind as two of them. But what about the others? Obviously not the Sun or Deception, or Music, but I'm interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm only missing the first note of the 7 for the Music Goddess atm, but still got plenty of places to visit. I've given the locations for the other 6 notes in the spoilers in my last few posts (just left-click on where it says +spoiler, in case you didn't know).<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I keep meaning to play Bastard of Kosigan but haven't got round to it as yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, many congratulations!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Sorry, meant to say: if you'd got everything Shin asked for, all you need to do is talk with him with all the components in your inventory, and he makes the armour automatically.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for me, I'm back off to the realm of Change...with the taste of ashes in my mouth...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

First, she still hasn't found the first note for the Music Goddess - I may have to see if I can find assistance in that from the Vault. Second, she can find no trace of the tiger raptor head for Puck. I remember encountering the matriarch, as well as killing many, many others of them, and I've been back twice to see if she just missed it, but no such luck. These are minor quibbles, though. On the plus side, that robe that made my male character look like a lampshade has become a clingy little number on Ren (it's the rebel Efreeti Sultan's gear from somewhere in the Fiery Warlord's realm that grants chaos shield on hit, as well as lots of other good stuff).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only gods I've yet to get on my side (that I <strong>can</strong> get) are Music - which is ongoing - Justice and Rulership. Both of the latter require my heading into the realm of Deception, which is where I'm going tomorrow. I've just got my blade from the Forge, so that won't hurt (well, not me, anyway), given that the baddie drow lady is supposed to be a greatsword expert. Well, we'll just see about that, shall we...<br/>\n<br/>\nI take it that, regardless of Aquarius' awesome (said through gritted teeth <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" />) achievement, we're still going for both big nasties at the final showdown, yes?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Sheet and discovered that i was running with the same gear from the end of the second module...Once Seo put her new armour &amp; trinkets on, then her AC was too high to be bothered from anything else than Boss-encounters. She also used her Empty-Body ability to great effect (50% Undispellable Concealment) so she barely ever got a hit or two.

Nevertheless, I've now got 18 gods standing behind me (there's a part of me that would really prefer them to be in front of me, but you can't have everything).<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, before going to say hi to Amon-Ra, it might be worth others noting that the god of the Forge doesn't do a blunt weapon for you (I think I noticed, Empyre, from your finale WM screen shot, that you'd also recognised that he also doesn't do scimitars). Essentially, it's Great sword or axe, Bastard or Long sword. It's a bugger, but I've already got 3 variations of +10 warhammers, together with one +9. So let's test what he's resilient to. That said, one of the things I've done with an unbuffed hp of 980 and AC of 81 is ignore what might be the best attack potential for something else that might crash through magic defences. It's all good stuff - the 3 different types of build I've played here really merit from understanding what they do and how they do it. The results are fascinating...and I'll bore you with them later.

Slower, certainly, but there are great gains from a \"no, you're not hitting me hard enough yet\" mentality - for example, those hideously quick bouncy creatures guarding the thing that's destroying all life - meh. Where before it was very much hit and run, with the Wall it was bob into view, hunker down, then take out a dozen in one go, chuckling as we go. That said, yes, you need some patience, but as I think I said in a previous post, it's well worth getting to know your character's strengths and weaknesses as you go along. And once you recognize that the Wall doesn't simply charge in and out, you should be fine. Being honest, it's the only character I've played who hasn't died once - and I'm still more a player than a builder.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to your second question, no. Certainly there are good axes out there (and yes, that includes some Dwarven Waraxes later on), but Warhammers worked very nicely. I've now played MTS three times and not once used the weapon the God of the Forge creates in the final conflict - nor has it been necessary. Oh, and I like the good, solid thump of a Warhammer. The only weapon I wish was more prevalent - pretty much everywhere - is the Morning Star, which no one seems to give any love.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> For the sake of completeness, the 4 hammers in my inventory at the end were:- <strong>Brimstone Hammer</strong>, +10 enhancement, keen, 1d8 negative energy damage, on hit lesser spell breach level 5; <strong>Warpstone Hammer</strong>, +10 AB, on hit Crumble level 10, 1d4 damage each of fire, acid, cold, divine, magical, negative, positive, electrical, sonic; <strong>Hammer of Kemour</strong>, +10 AB, 1d8 fire damage, 10 divine damage, on hit Stun DC20 25% / 3 rounds; <strong>Greater Hammer of Thunderbolts</strong>, +9 enhancement, keen, 2d8 electrical, on hit deafness DC24 25% / 3 rounds.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">After a stressful period of work and being generally down, I decided to take a break from WoG and try the OC, or as Hip calls it, the Plague Campaign, followed by the MTS trilogy. I decided to take the elven Princess S\u00fcel Nightingale, a\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-magical-master-cleric-15-wizard-23-monk-2-t515401.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">magical master</a> along, to learn the build in a less stressful environment than Greyhawk. The magical master starts as a 15 level cleric, getting all the good buffs at their cap (except Shield of Faith at +4), eventually gets a full wizard spellbook, EMA and EW at 39, and is still a 10 APR monk, taking monk levels at 17 and 40 (or 37, your choice).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was only my second time through the OC, and I found it exceptionally boring and tedious. I swear I did more damage to containers than to enemies. Who the hell designed this loot system and thought this is what players are going to find fun? Very long story short, I slogged through it (solo), there were the occasional moments of fun and depth. Since the build has an XP penalty from level 17 on, I waited on taking my final level until after Morag, and went into that module as a Cleric 15 / Monk 1 / Illusionist 1. I saw from Empyre's screenshots that non-XP-penalty characters earn over a million points over the campaign, so I should be able to hit 40. Also, whenever I'm lower level I get more XP, so in reality the penalty is less than the nominal 20%.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the OC, I was wondering how the build would fare in MTS's high magic world. On the plus side, it is Dex-based with max APR, which is great for high magic, the setting allows for maxing many abilities which is sorely needed here (Dex, Int/Wis, Con are the most important ones in that order) and of course it's an incredibly versatile character. However, because of the very high enhancement bonuses, extra feats, and loads of immunities that are normally found on high magic gear, I will eventually lose a lot of the edge given by all the buffs at my disposal. Turns out I shouldn't have worried.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I'm finding MTS FUN. I generally like when the hack and slash parts and the decision-making parts are separated, and MTS nails that perfectly. Especially in a game where the clock keeps on ticking during conversations and your buffs keep running out because you struck up a friendly conversation. It is of personal preference, but I love the level design, it reminds me of the Hell Revealed maps in Doom.<br/>\n<br/>\nI ended up doing quite a bit of the first module backwards. I did the wolf-fox thing, then went down to the sewers, and went all the way down and then up to the lab and then down Zael's mountain. Next was Khor, and again I found myself in his domain after I broke into his sanctuary in town. And then I did all the rest. I handed in the heads to the mayor, oopsie, and did not take the deal with the devil. Finished at level 26, Cleric 15 / Monk 1 / Wizard 10. The build devastated the module, killing Zael without breaking a sweat at level 20, even though I used my GMW'd OC kamas throughout, because the first one in MTS dropped from the final boss.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd thus the War of the Fallen began, and it was mostly another slaughterfest. The monster density in the riverside and surrounding areas is insane, but I guess they are there to help underleveled people catch up. I could not find a way to avoid the first volley by the Jacks (didn't have level 8 or 9 wizard spells at that point), so there was always the 5% chance of petrification. Went with Shin and helped the Wandering God for an insane kama. Since the cleric buffs are easily dispellable, as are the mage ones at those levels, the dragons at the end were annoying until I figured out that they stand no chance even when I'm unbuffed. The lady at the end was the only monster who could reliably hit me, but that got taken care of quickly with a Bigby 5. Finished at level 35, Cleric 15 / Monk 1 / Wizard 19.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here I am, at the very beginning of the third module. Full buffs: <br/>\n<br/>\n<span class=\"inline-attachment\">\n<dl class=\"fileimage display\">\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/201803/10758846_598a6756abc1df30e22d4f08e2cb8d04_t.png\" />\n</dl>\n</span><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The build you were running with is on page 4 of this thread (it's a human Bard 26/ Blackguard 4/ RDD 10 - and I'd still love to see how it all pans out if one takes an evil path - and if you're not about to do it, I might have to try your Kama Shinobi out).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only real potential issue I can see from your thought is what you need as wrap-ons. Admittedly, it all does go a bit berserk in the final part, but even then you can get stymied. For example, if you went for the build you posit and chose a kukri for your WoC you might well be royally screwed (I can't recall seeing any great kukris, but I've been known to be wrong - I know, scarcely believable!). It's one of the reasons I'm playing these modules quite a bit atm - trying to discover what works and what doesn't - which is probably more important for a non-arcanist like me than those fancy-arse spell-chuckers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other potential problem could become boredom, particularly in the second part, but a couple of areas in the third also come to mind. That's boredom from the sheer volume of nasty beasties you have to hack through to get to your destination, where an albeit beautifully finessed build might well hit every time it could still take months to get there, due to immunities and such.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, thus far I've been lucky in my build choices in my 3 trips through MTS (luck based on quality builds from others, I freely and gladly admit), but I'm sure I'm going to get clobbered soon. It's one of the reasons I'm particularly keen to see how Mirnaia's and Empyre's current builds are progressing, 'cause they're both Dexers, and one's a caster/cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers will, I'm sure, have better answers for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I have defeated Yggdrassil.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, I have no idea how quickly your WM's killed, but very few non-boss monsters took more than 2 rounds, most things die in 2 to 5 flurries. And the wonderful thing about clerics (a cleric's a wonderful thing), actually, one of the many many wonderful things is that you have divine favour and darkfire, so Dex-based cleric/monks have no trouble dealing damage. The mithril golems died in about two rounds. The abishais in the second module die in 2 flurries (the small ones) and the others in 3-4 flurries, and they are immune to fire. So in spite of the single target damage, things go rather quickly. Obviously a WM can spam whirlwind and devcrit everything. By the way, if you're hasted, is it 2 whirlwinds/round potentially, or does it stay at 1?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor defense, the build is very very safe. High AC, and by the time you get to the point where monsters really hurt you have Imp Invis, which is still an effective 25% concealment against blind-fighters, so against 20-hitters only every 30th hit connects on average, every 40th if they don't have blind fighting. Very manageable. If they could hit you on something else than a 20, there's Bigby's 5 (Mord first if they have SR). And you have buffs to protect against pretty much everything, but that point is rather moot in MTS, because you have gear which protects against pretty much everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bane of 10 APR monks is, of course, the damage shield. So far I've encountered wounding whispers (sonic) and elemental shield (fire). There is gear available to negate both, or Mord's (and there's an item that has 3 Mords/day, and everyone can use it).<br/>\n<br/>\nStag, the magical master is not really a caster build, because it only has 23 wizard levels and those come late, and it has dual-wield feats instead of spell penetration. If you want to cast offensively, you have to use spells that do not involve a saving throw, and if they do, you need to attack the enemy's weak save AND pray. If they have spell resistance, you have to Mord first to reduce it by 10. IGMS, the staple direct damage no save spell is not worth it against regular monsters once you get it because they have so much hp, and many bosses have been given some magic damage resistance in MTS specifically because of that spell (which also means divine favour is less good, but trust me, bosses still die quickly). And against those very few that do take a longer time (2nd module final boss 2nd phase) they have so much no chance that you can go make yourself a coffee while beating them to death. At about half the fight, come back to the keyboard to refresh divine power and divine favour.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

When I was fighting his avatar, I noticed that he was resisting the positive and negative damage that one kama was doing the also the electric and sonic damage that the other kama was doing, so I decided to switch them so the one in the main and was the one that also did 2d6 slashing damage, but apparently they were already in that order, so when I hit that key, it unequipped the kamas, leaving me fighting unarmed. I didn't notice right away, but I did notice that I was suddenly doing a lot more damage. It turns out that the gloves I was wearing for the +12 DEX were Monk gloves that was doing Divine and Magic damage, and he was not resisting either of those. So, I did the final fight unarmed, and it was much easier that it was for my scimitar-weilding Weapon Master in my earlier play-through.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere I am just before that final fight:<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jwuRm62.png\" /><br/>\nAielund is next for me.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Thus, I advanced only a little bit since my last posting.<br/>\nLet's see. I now have more than half the gods on my side, and every area is open to me from the central hub. I know of the connection between the Sun God and another one.<br/>\nI went to finish the Undead lands, and the devourers of existence with their on-hit greater dispel are really fun with 15 cleric levels. It was the first time I had some slow going, since I basically had to fight unbuffed. I could take on 3-4 at once with 50% concealment, and maybe have to drink a Heal, but they died slowly. Also, it was my fault for finding out rather late that the anti-nexus generates these monsters.<br/>\nOnce I was done, I went to under the Forge, where the petrification golems are. Since nothing protects entirely from petrification, I was very happy that I remembered that I sold all the Slaar arrows to Nicademus, went down and played ring around the rosies with the golems. As a <strong>serendipitous corollary</strong> to being an elf, I can use longbows.<br/>\nI believe the areas left are the Thunder realm and the fire castle before only the two final boss gates remain.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: If I remember, I'll save before entering the penultimate gate, to be able to do the final battle both ways.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Class features are \"fixed\" at certain value, so a build choice of the Plant domain on a Cleric to free up the slot for an Ammy of Wisdom becomes undoable because you're losing 7 AC from the +12 Amulet of Natural armor with the crappy +5 Barkskin that you have at your disposal, unless the settings have also changed Barskin to give a +12 AC bonus. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you do 2d12 Divine damage, plus another 2d12 vs Outsiders, your +6 damage that cost you two feats becomes \"meh\". But that's not even the whole point. The whole point, which is also the reason I say that you don't truly understand me, is the DIFFICULTY. No matter if it's balanced or not, I could possibly beat these modules with my most gimped builds without breaking a sweat. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe source of my sadness comes from the fact that this limited experience in very unchallenging settings (Aielund amongst them) ends up becoming the referential upon which to judge builds. How can you say a build is good by playing just these modules? The answer is: you can't.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a minor example, I finished The Aielund Saga with my Holy Weapon Master with Cheese using its unaltered version. The lack of the +8 Tumble AC from that Monk level at 37 wasn't a major issue either. When I tried to play her on WoG, I simply COULDN'T GET PAST level 25. It led me to rework the entire build and make it more solid. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy point here is not to advertise WoG, but to point out that, without ever having faced a serious challenge, you can't really become a better builder. If there was such a thing as a builder level from 1-40, Single Player modules would allow you to cap at 20, but the other 20 you'd still need to get out of your comfort zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs per requested, I'll say goodbye the old way. I have more to say on the topic, but RL calls. <br/>\nTake it EZ!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Sorry I couldn't conclude my point before. I don't mean to be offensive or bash at this series. I will actually play it myself one day. But I do mean to make a point. I prefer non-high Magic settings, so naturally I will be more of a fan of WoG or the Aielund Saga, with items capping at +6 and +7 respectively.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I'm talking about how each one of us builds our biases. I've done the OCs, and the whole Sands of Fate modules, and then Aielund Saga, and a Brazilian PW named Amnesia, snd then WoG. Before I played on WoG, I was SUCH A DIFFERENT player and builder. I am telling you that playing on WoG has made me about 10x better than I was before. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs an example, Order of the Wyrm wouldn't manage to survive there, let alone do quests. Only with help. I had a mate there who played with me for a while. He died SO MUCH with is, then he teamed up with me and managed to kill some regular mobs for a while, and then he just stopped playing there. At least I haven't seen him around. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy point is that, to understand where I'm coming from, you need to have first hand experience on a hard server. I don't know of any other server as hard and as balanced as WoG. It doesn't mean that there aren't, just that I don't know, because I found what I was looking for. After becoming a regular on WoG, I drastically changed the way I play. Now if I play Single Player modules, even Aielund, which is among the harder ones, I just steamroll them all. I played Diablo, Lord of Terror. I didn't break a sweat to beat some bosses, and now I can't get it to run properly in my game, probably because I'd need to downgrade my CEP version to make it work. I did download it, but don't seem to get it to run anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, you should have first hand experience in harder settings, and so should Empyre. Play on WoG offline for a few months, then get back to me on how it changed you. I'm sorry if I offended anyone. As I said, not my intention.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I can't speak for anyone else, but I certainly take no offence from what you say - I've said it before and I'll say it again - no learning is ever wasted.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it's certainly not that I sneer at WoG, or any other PW. Indeed, a couple of years ago I was about to embark on some coop with Hip in Deathlands, but alas, RL got in the way. To a certain extent, why I haven't thus far launched myself into that environment is down to technical stupidity (for example, I have absolutely no idea how to play WoG offline), and I don't have a tame 7-year-old to do it for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course I want to be a better player and builder - why else would I be here? (I mean in the ECB Guild, I'm not opening up a huge philosophical debate!) And why else would I keep asking dumb-ass questions? It ain't for my ego, I can tell you that! And this sort of discussion helps in that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the biggest help in the learning process is actually playing. Only that way do you truly understand how a build works (or doesn't), and environment is of course key to that. Now, I've only been playing NwN for about three and a half years, so I'm still learning - and enjoying myself as I go. And this module has actually helped me properly come to grips with, for example, Dwarven Defender. I get the engineering of it much better now. And, again using the DwD example, that learning process started with a discussion we had when I was coming up with my first independent build. Maybe it's time for the next stage, now...<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose it's down to learning styles. When learning to swim, for some people the best thing is to chuck them into the sea (and be there should they flounder). For others, the shallow end of the local pool is the best first step - or splash - before moving on to the deep end, and so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, all good stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I think Valerfor has updated the stuff you need for the Diablo campaign in the Modules forum here, if you haven't seen it yet. And I'm told Swordflight is an excellent module, but have yet to immerse myself - again, you can grab details in the Modules forum, if you're interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, my friend!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

He absolutely does what it says on the tin, and for those times when you might enjoy not being overly strategic (which is exactly what I wanted this time) in your approach, he's a joy. The only issue has been his AC. He does get hit quite a bit (which is only to be expected with a Dex of 9), but that's more than compensated for by the speed with which he dispatches enemies and more than adequate HPs. And it doesn't take long to adjust your tactics appropriately. Adding fuel to Max's complaint about the high levels of gear/magic in MTS, the AC issue is further negated by some of the kit available in the final part - regeneration, Dex and Con enhancements, various resistances and DR. Thanks for the build, Valerfor!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Though you will need blankets and food if you're resting in a non-designated location. You can grab or buy these right from the start, and it is all explained to you when you first load up the modules.<br/>\nThere aren't an over-abundance of clerics and blackguards, but there are some, and more of them as you progress through parts 2 and 3. The same applies to foes with SA and Ki damage. It's inevitable in a way: you should be expecting tougher foes as you progress, after all. And in part 3 you will be dealing with - and in some instances fighting - gods, so it was never going to be simple!<br/>\nIirc, you should be around level 24 by the time you face the dracoliches, so you should be alright (I assume you're going with your druid/bard/shifter), though it's still a bloody tough encounter, as they do heal themselves.<br/>\nIf you're going in from the OC you're likely to have better gear already than most of what's available in the shops of Twin Summit, and indeed most of the loot. Bags of holding are available for purchase in the town as well, so fret not. You will need to have lots of them eventually, unless you enjoy backtracking miles and miles lots of times (I generally have about 16-20). I'd go with robes of the Dark Moon and Sun Soul boots +5 (assuming your UMD is up to it). You'll start picking up better gear in part 2, and it gets a bit silly in part 3. I'd take all 3 belts of greater resistance, the Uthgardt anti-death one and a strength one. The rings you mention are good, as is the ring of Power and the one that boosts saves by 3. The Golden Circlet is the best helm in the OC imho. Never having played a druid or a shifter, I'll leave the rest to you!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a slow starter module, but once you get going, you'll be kept busy! Hope you enjoy it!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Fun read of everyone's experience (tho I am skipping bits about part 3 atm cos we haven't played it yet.) Thought you guys might be interested as we are sort of playing caster builds.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, as you will have worked out, a friend and I are playing this right now. I am a CHA sorceress with Divine Might. He is a WIS Cleric w/strength domain and LOTS of Divine Power and with a monk level or few (IDK how many right now) for tumble dumps and is using monk gear and kama. (Details of builds to come. I need to remember how to look up builds to see if we are using something similar to what exists.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHe is newish to NWN so we started in the OC using Tony K's on hardcore and left with basic +4/+5 gear (And a cheaty unlimited uses per day findtraps and knock item cos the OC is unbearable without *grin*). <br/>\n<br/>\nWe kind of blundered our way around MTS1 after somehow forgetting to talk to the councillors, first to the dwarves, then the sewers, but no enemy was too much trouble. Imp invis, stoneskin/premonition, shadow shield/death ward, flame weapon, mind blank and not much could touch us. IGMS annoyingly didn't work at times due to magical resist, (which is always worrying as a Sorc as you sort of rely on that to work if nothing else does), but with us both playing mostly melee (against mobs at least. I went caster mode for bosses) it was pretty much a breeze, so enemy ACs of mobs certainly weren't an issue even with a sorc AB. Enemy HP for evocation spells were quite high but fine for an epic module. A melee mage type build did seem to be the way to go with the number of enemy mob spawns. (And I hate to spam rest). <br/>\n<br/>\nMTS 2 was quite a shock/step up tho! That's for another post tho.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

We did those before I found the thread, sowwy! <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, MTS2. It's quite a step up, no? <br/>\n<br/>\nI accept the need for some immunities in a SP game. No one likes being frightened for forever while a dragon pecks at you so immunity to fear or even mind affecting spells I can see the point of. (Tho tbh I'd rather see fear duration reduced and lots of high will save items than immunity items, cos even fear immunity reduces the paladin class to a degree, but anyway, that's my 'ideal' module. I can certainly adapt.) <br/>\n<br/>\nFeats on items tho... +5d6 sneak attack? Improved evasion? Not much incentive to play a rogue in this. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is MP tho. For a module expecting a balanced party, which presumably means divine and arcane magic to buff/protect as well as attack, one wonders why it has such incredibly high magic items. Seems better suited to a group of friends all wanting to play warrior. <br/>\n<br/>\n/Rant<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, MTS2. The beginning was a bit samey, but really cool models, no? All my spells worked on the mobs but playing melee mage style with Divine Might and with a WIS rather than STR based cleric they took a while. And OMG, everyone had magic resist! At least make it 50% immunity, not resist 10! The only creatures IGMS worked against were the mobs and when you have 20 2d6 missiles and 20 enemies it doesn't do a lot! I kept it in my spellbook out of habit/obstinance, but it had next to no use. All bosses were immune. In addition, Summons were simply useless. Even trying to use a lvl9 summons as a distraction while you raised your companion didn't give you more than a few breaths respite. They last seconds. <br/>\n<br/>\nWail of the banshee was fun tho *grin*. In the end we ran around a lot getting them to chase us (Perfect for a speedy monk 3 caster, but I wasn't playing one, lol), set up a trap with web in a choke point and either Wailed on them or Storm of Vengence and hit them. Cc disablers like confusion and fear worked against some mobs. Using the evocation spells meant expending most of your arsenal on the mobs and really wasn't getting anywhere. They were just irrelevent on bosses. Even as a sorc where I could expend 3 or 4 entire spell levels of whatever element they were weakest to, I still had to hit them with Divine Might for a long time in the end. <br/>\n<br/>\nOFC, I could hit the bosses because of the wonderfully OP Bigby's hands. They were a lifesaver. And a game changer if I read the thread comments correctly. They took the majority of the bosses out of the equation altogether. Together with Death Magic for their bodyguards we had less trouble with many of the boss fights than with the mobs! On the rare occassion bigby's were avoided Harm usually did the trick. We used Harm more as a backup as he wanted to play a warrior priest archetype. but I think you could harm and storm your way thru this (as you can thru most I suppose) fairly easily. You could also spam rest and wail thru the mobs. Mords was occasionally useful against bosses, but mostly for reducing SR it has to be said. Not that I had that much trouble with it, barring the usual dragons. <br/>\n<br/>\nI only really remember a couple of spellcaster bosses. One was no challenge as he had but one spell mantle. The other took a few flame arrows and mords to subdue as he had multiple, but fun caster battles were few and far between. In MP, as a sorc, I like to set myself up with all the dispels so I can counterspell, just for fun, but there's really no point here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose, reading this back, I seem a bit down on it. I shouldn't. It *was* fun and challenging. We are, in the end, playing the wrong characters for this module, in terms of design at least, but that doesn't make it not fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

A good fortitude save is a start, but those casters have some nasty defences they can throw up, and it won't work as a first (ie most likely to hit) attack on a build with ED - and that's leaving aside crit-immune types.

Apart from the innate unfairness of them, it's a dangerous game to play without any sort of DR and their enhancements negate the usefulness of DR spells.\u00a0 The dinosaurs (Cool models, no?) were particularly difficult.

We had to abandon our not sleeping too much approach and stock up on bedrolls as prolifigate use of spells is what is keeping us alive tho that is as much area/enemy design as any increase in difficulty.

Interestingly enough (I use the word loosely), an old line manager of mine who studied Classics at Oxford told me that I tended to form my sentences/arguments in a \"Latinate\" style to this day, so something must have stuck.<br/>\n<br/>\nAncient Greek wasn't available until the 4th year, and I chose to study it. At that point I was fascinated by the Greek myths (and no few of them are Cretan/Minoan, of course), and thought it would be fun, so dropped Physics for it. But it was just the language, and it was hard - and there were only 4 of us studying it in my year, so bunking off was difficult. On the sunny side, when taking my first degree - in Philosophy, as it happens - the Ancient Philosophy and Philosophy of Natural and Social Sciences modules improved my knowledge of both Greek and Physics - a double win!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now a triple - I didn't know that about \"beta\".

One thing I always found interesting was how direct and descriptive Latin is, where Greek is much more nuanced and sensitive (for want of a better word). In the translation of Plato's \"Theaetitus\" (or it could have been the \"Symposium\", forgive me, I'm getting old) that I had, there was a 14 page \"footnote\" on a particular use of a particular word for \"love\"! It would seem that context and environment is as important for language as it is for Neverwinter!

I'm currently playing this series with Valen Shadowbreath. So far I've killed some Rashasae (or whatever the plural of this thing is), stuff in the sewers, Frost Giants, Fire Giants, the Red Dragon, Minotaurs, and a lot of easy shit. I was asked by a certain Dwarf to take a look at the abandoned mine, which is plagued with Undead, and he gave me a key. I went to the correct area, a map called Abandoned Mine, then I dropped down a well, and went to a Mithril door after killing the zombies and the Pit Fiend in that area. The key given to me by the master foreman doesn't open the door. How am I supposed to go in?<br/>\n<br/>\nOH, and there was a spider who dropped a gland that costs 0 GP, which should mean it's a quest item, but I haven't found anywhere to deliver it...

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hey again, guys!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, let me give you my honest impression about the first module. First and foremost, I LIKE Hack and Slash modules with some kind of plot going on. I LOVE when there are twists and turns and you have to figure out what's going on, but at the same time it's not so specific that you have a chance of getting stuck for not finding the correct spot / NPC to talk to (especially on a HUGE place, which is not the case here). So, in terms of story, this module is almost tailor-made to me.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n1- I think the story so far is GREAT! I love the straightforwardness of it all, and I love that even though it's pretty simple, there ARE still side quests and things you can do in a different order to change it up a bit between runs. I'm NOT a fan of class-specific quests.\u00a0<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>I don't see any reason why the Order of the Mithril Hand can't give you the damned quest if you're not a Monk. Especially since it's just to bring Lord Shin's head. They could just give you the whole speech about \"it has to be someone from outside\" like the others, and I wouldn't be feeling like I'm missing out on something because I'm not a Monk.\n</details>\n\n2- I think the areas are pretty well-designed, with ONE exception. There are no traps to recover / set ANYWHERE. The first NPC does tell you that, but that also means you can't really play a sneaker.<br/>\n<br/>\n3- It's GREAT that there are pretty much endless weapons that you can get and most are on par with one another, the only downside is that the weapon you can get made for you can't be \"every\" kind. So your john does will have more choices of weapons to wield. Valen wields a heavy flail, and there is ONE good one that I already know where to go get, but there are a few Longswords, Katanas and Greatswords to choose from. So, even though there are many options, there aren't really that many UNITS for each option to choose from.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n4- The items are WAY too powerful for the level of competition you face. There is an item combo that pretty much allows you to take 0 damage for EVERYONE except bosses and very few others.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Ring of Power, Moss-covered cloak, Khor's Armor\n</details>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThat means that most of the fights are won while you can go do something else entirely, then return and find your toon uninjured surrounded by remains. It doesn't help that casters cast only elemental damage spells, which play right into this item combo. That's too good, and makes combat unchallenging. Finally, monsters hardly ever use a combat feat, except for Smite Good, which ironically doesn't work on Valen, cuz he's Evil LOL. Although it IS nice to take a breather from \"hardcore\" combat, it's also kind of dull when you're surrounded by 10 frost giants and don't really fear for your life. I'm hoping it'll get harder in MTS2, or else I doubt it'll entice me enough to go through it many times.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, all bosses so far have been pretty underwhelming for my taste. I'm waiting for EPIC boss battles, even if they are easy in comparison to WoG, but bosses who at least feel threatening. The only boss I died to was one that used Implosion and I rolled a 1. That's about it. I would like to have to \"figure out\" the battle, like, come up with a tactical approach to beat it, you know? But, alas, the old \"click KD and attack them all surrounded by enemies\" works just fine...<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless, I'm having fun. More for finding out about the story than for actually enjoying the journey, but it is what it is. I guess my final recommendation for this series so far is to bring your most gimped builds. Maybe that would make it a bit more exciting. Optimized builds just tear through this module too easily for my taste.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you guys agree with me?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I won't lie to you, it's my least favourite of the 3, and I've generally come into it direct from the OC, meaning my starting gear is nearly always better than anything available in the little town and its surroundings, so it can get a wee bit tedious.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout giving away any spoilers, you might want to have a sort of map for the second part, as it can get a bit confusing - and you will want to explore everywhere. Alas, iirc, you still won't find many (if any) traps to play with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm glad you're having fun, though. To my mind, it's a module that you can jump into after a tough day and just beat the crap out of lots of things without a huge amount of thought, and sometimes that's just what you need.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I visited all 3 places, found Orwick, went to the Clockwork Factory, killed the very difficult enemies (finally I actually had to be tactical!), although I suspect they were hard only because Valen's AC is abysmal. Then, after I destroyed the warpstone, I received a Journal entry saying that the goddess had manifested in Destruga, and I should seek her out. Except I have been ALL OVER the place, including the Fountain (which I don't know what it's for yet), and I couldn't locate the goddess. I spoke to Orwick again, got the same dialogue than when he gave me the quest.\nWhere is she??\n</details>\n\nThanks to anyone who can help! I hate getting stuck...

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks, Empyre!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nI finished the module with Valen Shadowbreath and I suppose I did all the feasible quests. It's always nice to get the full flavor the first time around. I have a few impressions to share about the module:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- The Story: I liked the main story of the module, although most NPCs aren't really communicative, that actually makes it straightforward. You see a named NPC, you talk to them, otherwise, you don't. The whole plot has interesting twists and turns, but there's a little too many \"go there, kill that guy for me and bring me his head or an item so I can craft something for you\" quests. They could be a bit more diverse, like save someone, defend someone or some place, discover information, etc... That's my only complaint.<br/>\n<br/>\n2- The Magic Level: To me, it was way too high-magic. You can pretty much get +12 to all stats, multiple immunities to pretty much everything there is, and a lot of DR against all kinds of damage. That makes the game too imbalanced in favor of Fighter types. It's impossible to play a caster. You can play a sneaky character, but mostly as a Fighter, since there's no sneakiness to be had.<br/>\n<br/>\n3- The Author: This guy doesn't seem to know very much about the game. He suggests that this module should be played by a PARTY of 2-4 starting at 15th level, and I had the easiest time of my life soloing it with a good build, but not one of my best ones. Also, this guy seems to have some OCD issues. Did you guys notice how 98% of the maps in the series are symmetrical? It kind of ruins the surprise a bit, since you know what's on the other side before even exploring it. He also seems obsessed with dual-wielding warriors. And it's not restricted to small weapons either. DW Katanas are all over the place. Another indication he doesn't know the game very well. I wonder if monsters get the penalties for DWing non-small weapons. hmm...<br/>\n<br/>\n4- The Difficulty Level: The module was overall too easy. I literally didn't break a sweat to destroy everything in the first 2 acts. For the most part, I was fighting with Valen's preferred weapon (Heavy Flail) and still regenerating faster than they could damage me. Then, in the last act, things started to get interesting. There are some monsters that do insane damage with some elemental blasts, and some really nasty fighters, like the Drow and the Golems. But then there are some other ones that are very easy, and they are worth sometimes the same amount of XP or more than the harder ones. One thing I would've liked to see are harder bosses. Bosses in this module are mostly underwhelming. Even in the final battle, against the Sun God, it's LONG, but you're hardly ever at risk. And you can just click on attack and just sit back and watch, since there isn't anything you can do when you start battling. Not to say I didn't do anything, I used Divine Might and healed a couple of times. He couldn't hit Valen's 88 AC without Divine Shield, so no reason to even cast it, and he's immune to crits, so no DevCrit in the final battle, which I think is good.<br/>\n<br/>\n5- Other Considerations: Some of the landscapes are really awesome, and the monster appearances are very cool too. I like the rest restrictions, but I would've liked to see the WoG implementation of the Bedroll, so that you don't consume it when you rest. Instead, you pick it back up. Imagine how cool that would be, and how much space it'd save!!! Combat is very repetitive, but if you spread out your sessions and don't play for a long time, it's actually a fun module for, as Stag said, mindlessly bashing foes after a hard day at work. I will play it again, with another Fighter-type. It's a good break from WoG, where I actually have to pay attention to stay alive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all the help! And shame on him for never making the NPC to collect Vorguloth's Head! That thing was in my inventory to the bitter end!<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It would be greatly appreciated if you guys can answer some of my questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) There are gods standing behind me on each act. My character specialiazes in warhammers so i chose the forge god. But it doesnt seem to change anything in game. What are they for?<br/>\n<br/>\n2) I couldn\u2019t find any use for Head of Vorguloth(on act 2) and Shin\u2019s Head(act 1). Were there any quests related to them?

The idea is for you to recruit as many as you can to your cause - though there are a couple you're never going to win over, for obvious reasons. You have to travel to each god's realm (not all will be available to you to start with) and get enough of them to support you for the Moon Goddess (iirc) to open up the doorway to your final battle. Some will give you quests, some will reward you, but regardless, you need more than half of them with you. There is no advantage to one god over another.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) No one I know of has ever found a use for Vorguloth's head - it just sits in your pack and rots (though it transpires that he was the bastard who took out the contract on you in Hell, so he needs a lopping off regardless). Susymog's goes to the monk in Shin's home, who'll give you some rewards. In part 1, the chief monk in the temple in the town of Twin Summits asks you for Shin's head, but, again, I've never known anyone successfully turn it in to her. You can always show it to him later if you like (not that he'll notice).<br/>\n<br/>\nHope some of this helps!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

In fact, I have yet to use any of his weapons. (Shin and Zael will also offer to craft things for you, with the right ingredients, but again, I doubt they'll be of much use to you.) Don't worry about your hammers: you should have a fair assortment of really good ones by the end - just pay attention to which hammer does what, and use them as you see fit. Iirc, the Warpstone Hammer can be found in the Realm of Change (also known as the Realm of Destruction). Lots of tough golems to deal with there!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's perfectly possible to get all the gods on your side - in fact, I'd recommend it - except 2 - one of whom is your main antagonist, the other his lover, so it was never looking good to get them in your corner. So you can get all the rewards on offer (remember to get all the notes for the Singing God I listed their locations somewhere here).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it all starts out even: you have 2 in gang before you begin - Humour and Wandering (unless you screwed up freeing Persephone in Part 2, of course). The Moon Goddess will simply wait for you to get over the majority line (though, iirc, you will need Death on your side first).<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: It seems I misremembered which gods are which. It's the Fate Goddess who allows the final confrontation to take place, and you need to have the Moon Goddess on your side - which means getting Change beforehand. There are 20 in total, so you need 10, as Fate makes the 11th. I'd still go for 18, though. Oh, and the 2 you can't get are Sun and Deception - you can choose whether to face them both together at the climax, or just the Sun God ('cause you've already killed the Spider Queen).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

After gathering some info on builds, heres the contenders:<br/>\n1) F8B4AA28 - the simplest one, typical dex archer. Nothing ourstanding except for WS/EWS. Can dip in str a bit. Damage before bow is 14EA+6EWS=20<br/>\n2) R16W1AA23 - The most defensive one with Epic dodge and SC5, at least as I see it to be. Also have Uncanny dodge and Imp evasion. A bit of sneaking involved. Cool for night elf roleplay. Damage before bow = 12<br/>\n3) M10W1AA29 - The speedy one. Have access to monk AC and Imp evasion. Thats pretty much it I guess. Can dip into str. Damage before bow = 15<br/>\n4) P9W1AA30 - Divine archer with high Cha. This one is tempting for obvious dmg reasons, but defenses seem to be on lower side, even with Divine shield. Damage before bow 16DM+15EA=31<br/>\nThere was also a RDD one which is highly reliant on mighty bows.

One solution is F / W / AA, eliminating the EXP penalty because Wizard is the favored class for Elves, but you lose Bard benefits such as higher BAB progression than Wizard and Tumble as a class skill.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I foubd the main quest guy and he told me what he wanted. I explored the whole town and talked to pretty much all the named NPCs and couldnt find a single side quest ?

Meanwhile imma keep looking :)</div></blockquote>\nWhat, no side quests at all? What about the clerics, the monks, the Dartmoths, the dwarves, the Major, the man in the prison (there may be more that I've forgotten)? You did talk with Lady Phio, right - because she's your guide and mentor through all three modules?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You do a favour for one of the blokes downstairs, then when you've succeeded he allows you upstairs to meet the head honcho, who gives you another quest and opens his shop to you. When you've done that one, he offers to craft you a quality weapon, but whether it's useful depends on what you're using, though you can always sell it elsewhere.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

And I'm \"unspoilering\" this because it's a very common head-scratcher. Even if you've been given the quest of Shin's head by the monks, you can't hand it in - to anyone, ever (I've walked through all three modules with it in my pack to no gain). There's another one of these in the second module, the head of Vorguloth, which is equally useless.<br/>\nJust one of MTS's quirks!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

They do tend to fire off the petrify gaze in the first flurry, so if you can get through that you're golden. And to be fair they only do minimal damage to you while you're petrified - the danger is if something else big and ugly comes wandering along while you're still stoned. I seem to remember someone had an interesting tactic: he herded all the little packs into one great mass then simply fireballed them into roast pumpkin.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's one much more challenging area open to petrification in Part 3, and I wish you well with it. Let us know if you struggle with it and we'll drop a hint or two.<br/>\n<br/>\nPart 2 is something of a grind, but it's an xp goldmine! I normally finish that part at around level 35/6. Susymog can be a damned tough scrap as well (I assume the monk in Shin's area pointed you in the right direction).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You'll first need to get to the place where you can sell that humongous amount of gear you've gathered. Once you see Charon, you'll know you're in the right area, and he'll sail you there. Don't worry if you haven't finished everything before travelling, you can come back, vastly wealthy and unburdened by sheets and sheets and bags and bags of holding bursting with stuff. Each trader on the island will offer a different price for your stuff, so play smart. They also have a finite sum of money, and you can easily drain them all of funds. Worry not, Shin has a friendly trading angel when you get to his place - and you'll get the info for where to find it from the chap in the central tower on the island. The monk who gives you the Susymog quest is also there.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy strategy for Part 2 is basically to go clockwise from when I exit the very first screen (sort of 7 o'clock to 12), and clear everything on that side until getting to the Charon screen (the huge river - the Styx - looming in the distance of the screen should be a bit of a giveaway as well). Then I re-stock and sell stuff, get Charon to take me back, and go from 12 to 5 o'clock. Don't miss any screens and secret doors en route in both directions! Then back to the island and sell some more, if they still have any coin left, or go straight to see Shin (I wouldn't advise his brother - you'll be seeing him eventually anyway, but if you've gone for evil, he's your man - but he has no shop). Shin will certainly have a quest for you.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

No. It's either solo or with a friend or two in coop.<br/>\n2. They help, of course, but you can achieve everything without them.<br/>\n3. Again, Open Lock helps (particularly in the second part, or you'll have to start dropping stuff rather than sticking it in a nearby chest - it's a long haul before you find a merchant), but everything can be bashed. Some doors can't, but that's because they're plot or quest related.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
