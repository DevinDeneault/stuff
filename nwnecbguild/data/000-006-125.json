If you went Monk 30 Fighter 4 CoT 6, you'd get +3 to all saves, WF:Kama (which you can swap for WF: Unarmed as a requirement for CoT and then use one of the CoT bonus feats to take it again), Divine Wrath, and +2 feats (besides the aforementioned WF:Kama). You could then take 4 Fighter and 4 CoT pre-epic and that would give you another BAB point AND you could use a CoT bonus feat to take EWS, making Fighter 5 unnecessary. If you swap some feats around, you can reach a higher strength, maybe reaching a lower SR for 2 Great Strengths (one in place of EWS and another in place of ISR or even in place of Epic Prowess, maintaining said SR and increasing only damage by 1).<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">That's easy to answer, the difference between 35 and 30 levels of Monk is to be affected by mages on hard areas or not. Simple as that. That is why also the SR feats went first in the list and not last.<br/>\n<br/>\n35 levels and early SR feats is the minimum if you want to stay fully competitive in level appropriate hard areas. the difference between 30 and 35 Monk levels is not 5 SR less but 7 because you loose also the bonus Monk feat that is used for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nDamage and AB can be increased simply by going Half-Orc as i stated at the start but i found this one to be more balanced, that being said if you have trust in your abilities then by all means go for that. As it is now, the Bosses will affect you of course and some Archmages too, the rest of them will try to put up damage shiels if they have the time or simply melee you with their swords. With a full Monk 40 and 3 Sr feats for a total of 56 SR nothing sort of the Bosses will attempt to cast even a single spell on you. With 30 levels and 1 SR feat for a total of 42 SR (which is still good) you will be affected in hard level appropriate areas but you will be immune to all the rest of magelings.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaking two more Gr. STR feats isnt possible except if you want to pass on the WF, EP, feats so we leave that out and taking one less Monk for one more Fighter is loosing the AS feat for taking it back with the extra Fighter feat but loosing a net 1 SR.<br/>\n<br/>\nAB and Damage is still very good if you take into consideration the Monk attack schedule and the extra two attacks. Trust me when i say he hits like a truck, especially in the Half-Orc version of him.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany people are not aware of the usefulness of the many monk levels and simply stop where improved evasion is gained. But the truth is that Monk's have lots to give especially after 16th level. You just need to know where to stop. If only for the mind affects immunity it is fully worth it to go for 20 Monk levels. When i post my Kensai you will see what i mean. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the input Max.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I understand your point in this build, man, but being affected or not by the spells, with CoT levels and Improved Evasion, what could possibly damage you except for IGMS? And even against those spells, when cast at you, you'd have a pretty good chance of resisting most of them. I know he hits like a truck, any Monk with over 16 levels and STR-based will have possibly the highest damage output in NWN save very few exceptions. Since I too play on WoG, I understand your bias in making him this way, but he'd be WAY BETTER against everything else by being just a little worse against mages with my suggested alterations. <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW he hits like a truck and runs like Speedy Gonzalez!

With the ability to hit hard, and that eye-popping SR, it's hard to go wrong with him.<br/>\n<br/>\n I've never played a monk before, so I created a monk build in a CBC spreadsheet with the same class/level split, to see how mine would turn-out compared to yours, as a learning tool.  Yours was a little different (better), so I am going with your build.  I have one comment and a question:<br/>\n<br/>\n 1) Improved Critical has a prerequisite of a +8 BAB, so it can't be taken at level 9.  If it is swapped with Lightning Reflexes (at level 12), that will work.<br/>\n<br/>\n 2) Is there a particular reason for the class ordering between levels 2-7, other than for balance?<br/>\n<br/>\n Nice job on this build.

I would select Great Fortitude first as i did in the Half-Orcish version.<br/>\n<br/>\n 2) I took Fighter at 2nd lvl because with Monks you usually want to behave like a Fighter would for the first few lvls and dress in Full Plate and Shield. Other environments and modules will be more forgiving. Generally the best order to take these lvls would be Monk at 1st, 2nd and 7th lvl, with Fighter in between from lvls 3rd to 6th.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks for the input,<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">\u00a0 That depends a lot on your environment, i do not have any idea what kind of PW Dor Maegling is, neither it's cap on items or if you can craft or simply find them. But if it serves you i can do a basic analysis for (+5) caped items and also give you the basis for Monk's strategies. Alright, here we go,<br/>\n<br/>\nBasic AC calculation for (+5) item modules:\u00a0 28 (Base) +6 (DEX) +5 (WIS) +4 (Haste) +5 (Robe) +5 (Sun Soul Boots) +5 (N/A Amulet) +5 (Deflection Cloak/Cape) = <strong><em>63 AC</em></strong><em> (Half-Orc Version)</em><br/>\n<br/>\nConclusion for AC: <em><strong>63 AC</strong></em> is on par with a full plate and shield warrior with access in full tumble and even slightly more than that. This is considered to be a good AC everywhere, although not ground-braking by any means. Some flexible warriors would have this kind AC plus the option for Expertise to raise it further at the cost of their AB but that would require an investment in your INT that you do not have currently. Instead what you do have is...<br/>\n<br/>\n a) Monk Speed: Monk's 35th level of speed makes him faster than the eye (especially when combined with haste) can perceive and allows him to chose the ground for his battles, simply put, if a fight goes wrong for the Monk, he can simply escape and return when he is ready. He can most effectively also make hit-and-run tactics, often employing his stunning fists ability to great effect.<br/>\n<br/>\n b) Empty Body: This ability which can not be dispelled, lasts for 35 Rounds each time and you can use it twice per day, before you need to rest. It gives you a net 50% concealment making half of the attacks who would otherwise penetrate your AC, hit thin air.<br/>\n<br/>\n c) Great Offense: Lets leave the numbers speak here, you will have (8!) Attacks/Round (Haste and Flurry Of Blows) that each does some serious damage and all of you attacks have the Monk's progression (-3 instead of -5). Furthermore you willl have 35 uses for your Stunning Fist ability that can freeze an opponent for three rounds making him a sitting duck and of course Improved Knocckdown at your disposal. When you have this kind of offense, foes do not live long enough to do serious damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0 Here are some basic strategy tips you will have to follow if you want to make great use og Monks in general...<br/>\n<br/>\n 1) Always try to buff your main stats. (STR &gt; WIS &gt; DEX &gt; CON) in that order. You will possibly not be able to buff them at the cap (+12) using permanent items but you can for sure compine permanent buffs (items) wiith temporary ones (potions) to get the most out of them. Monks are like that, they need stats the most along with Paladins. Feed them well and they will make you happy.<br/>\n<br/>\n 2) Avoid clustered positions. NWN 1 has a bad understanding of character commands and often will leave you wide open without an input on your attack sequence, causing you to be flat-footed. Most player death's on inexperienced/ average players comes from that very reason. Flat-footed does not only means the loss of your DEX-based AC but a lot more, inclluding all of your Tumble AC as well. If you are involved in such a situation thne watch closely the upper left corner of your screen and make sure your character has commands (simple attacks/ ikd/ stunning fist) at all times. Do not click outside of the fight or a foe that you cannot reach, or else the computer will try to execute this move, it will find it impossible and then it will leave you with an empty attack sequence causing you to be flat-footed!<br/>\n<br/>\n 3) Use your active feats and abilities: Monk's have a variety of options, IKD, Stunning Fist, Empty Body and Flurry Of Blows. While it can be lot's of fun simply point your character in one direction and let him bash on opponents with his unarmed attacks you can always do better by taking the fight in your hands. Watch your combat log or simply observe the fight. Do you hit easily your opponents? If YES, then use Flurry Of Blows for more attacks! Do you face a mage/ cleric/ rogue? Then use your Stunning Fist! Do you face a particularly difficult opponent in melee? Then use Empty Body! The fight seems lost? Get away with your Monk Speed and heal up, then return using stealth or simply drink an invisibility potion then attack first using an opening move with two-or-three Stunning Attacks then quickly back away. Did you succeed? Then rush forward and finish him while he is a sitting duck! Don't forget your Stunning Fists, it is a powerful tool, especially with buffed wisdom. And IKD is dead-useful too.<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0 I hope i helped some, i cannot possibly transfer you all of my wisdom accumulated through years of hardcore playing, but these should suffice considering that this Monk is (although slightly less than a pure) very well protected. Most warriors would kill for even one of your class features and you have several in your disposal (SR 49, Mind-Effects Immunity, Empty Body, Monk Speed, Improved Evasion e.t.c) so make use of them. If however you do want some greater protection then we can re-arrange the build suited to your tastes since Dev. Crit. is not allowed there and we could incorporate both of the Expertise feats along with better starting WIS for even more AC. That build would be more balanced, somewhat like the first (Dwarven) version of it with slightly less AB/Dmg but also with way better defenses.<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">But my personal opinion is that i don't think it will hit like a trunk.<br/>\n A FT8-COT10-WM22, with dualwielding kukri and devastical critical, could easily have a 50 AB, and attack with Mainhand:48/43/38/35, Offhand:48/43 (6 APR).It is far better and devastical than the FoB AB: +38/ +35/ +32/ +29/ +26/ +38 (6 APR), not to menstion that when hasted the FoB will place after the free attack of haste and received a AB of +33 only.(See the comment near the end).<br/>\n<br/>\n A FT8-COT10-WM22 would have a Saving Throws of 30/20/30(vs Spells: +4) on par with the 30/24/26(vs Spell: +6) of this build.<br/>\n<br/>\n The outstanding part of this build shoule be defences against the magic. With the Improved Evasion and Mind Effect Immunity and SR 49, Saving Throws of 30/24/26(vs Spell: +6) should be hight enough against magic. And Stunning Fist is a real mage killer, no to mention that it has many 35 uses per day. This build is truely a mage slayer.<br/>\n<br/>\n But what i truely like about this build is the moving speed. I don't like spend a lot of time in game just running around and seeing sight. When playing offline module, i always give my character a dm_mylittlepony or even go as further as use the leto to give him a dm_fast speed.<br/>\n<br/>\n PS: According to the nwnwikia, link below, the FOB should give the monk a free attack with main hand with full attack bouns. So i think the attack shold be FoB AB: +38/ +35/ +32/ +29/ +26/ +38, instead of +38/ +35/ +32/ +29/ +26/ +23. Although the wiki do state clearly that the free attack ignore dual-wielding penalties and never benefit from a monk's unarmed attack progression, it fails to point out if the FoB penalties should apply. I choose to believe that the FoB penalties should apply. Futhermore, when you are hasted the FoB free attack is placed behind the hasted attack, so a -5 AB penalties should apply. So when hasted, the result would be\u00a0<span style=\"color:#000000\">\u00a0+38/ +35/ +32/ +29/ +26/ +38 / +33.</span><br/>\n It is what i deduct from the statement of wikia, so take it with a grain of salt. And actually i am new to nwn ecb, so what i am truely want is to learn and see if i am incorrect. So if anyone findout where i am wrong, which i think shoule be plenty, please do point out.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Attacks_per_round\" rel=\"noreferrer\"

Like I said. It comes down to APR.\u00a0 And against crit immunes kama is even more dominant because the kama AB will hit more often.<br/>\n<br/>\n I've seen several builds that use weapons for a monk that bypass the monk progression and I just shrug.\u00a0 I'll be the first to admit that kamas are boring.\u00a0 Repeat. BORING! But that's the point.\u00a0 Monk is such a dominant class, they had to do something to limit its potential by staying thematic.\u00a0 If you want to dominate as a monk, you have to use the tools the class provides. On my \"wish list\" would be that shurikens should use the same -3 BAB progression.\u00a0 At least that way, a monk could use a different attack once in a while without becoming unbalanced yet still remain \"monkish\" (I've always had a picture of a monk in AD&amp;D as a ninja-like figure but that's just my own warped bias).\u00a0\u00a0 Monks would sooner give up their calling than pick up a range weapon, the way its constructed in v3.0.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That's because you can only take Epic Weapon Specialization on a Fighter or CoT level, so you need to keep that 5th Fighter level back until epic levels (even though you won't be using it as a bonus feat, 'cause it isn't one), or you'll never get EWS.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sorry if that means going back - but I've just sorted out a couple of modules (well, had them sorted for me) that will balance things for you, so you can load a character up to level 24 and then take it back into the fray appropriately balanced (those being the Halls of Advanced Training and the Pretty Good Character Creator, discussed in the \"Pretty Good Character Creator...\" thread in the General Discussions sub-forum here.<br/>\n<br/>\nApologies for the transgression, but good to meet you regardless, and hope you'll stick with us.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If you went Monk 30 Fighter 4 CoT 6, you'd get +3 to all saves, WF:Kama (which you can swap for WF: Unarmed as a requirement for CoT and then use one of the CoT bonus feats to take it again), Divine Wrath, and +2 feats (besides the aforementioned WF:Kama). You could then take 4 Fighter and 4 CoT pre-epic and that would give you another BAB point AND you could use a CoT bonus feat to take EWS, making Fighter 5 unnecessary. If you swap some feats around, you can reach a higher strength, maybe reaching a lower SR for 2 Great Strengths (one in place of EWS and another in place of ISR or even in place of Epic Prowess, maintaining said SR and increasing only damage by 1).<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div></blockquote>\nMax suggestion gave me an idea. This is a variation of your unleashed build but with more dex, two kamas and 9 or 10 attacks per round (with haste) (so more chances of dev crit per round). Why waste the WF:Kama feat if you can gain 2 attacks per round at the cost of 1d6 instead of 1d20 base weapon damage ?\u00a0<br/>\nSacred Defense allows you to drop saving throws feats (Great Fortitude etc.).<br/>\nThen you can learn the Ambidextry, two weapons fighting and improved two weapons fighting.<br/>\nFurthermore, with kamas, you don't have to wear monk gloves, so you can wear dexterity gloves (and a stenght belt) which are commons items.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's a quick proposition of variation :<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk(30), Fighter(4), Champion of Torm(6), Half-Orc<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nSTR: 18 (32)<br/>\nDEX: 16<br/>\nCON: 14<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 10<br/>\nCHA: 6<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHalf-Orc: (Darkvision)<br/>\n01: Monk(1): Luck of Heroes, {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}<br/>\n02: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus: Kama<br/>\n03: Monk(2): Power Attack, {Deflect Arrows}<br/>\n04: Fighter(2): STR+1, Blind Fight, (STR=19)<br/>\n05: Monk(3)<br/>\n06: Monk(4): Great Cleave<br/>\n07: Monk(5)<br/>\n08: Monk(6): STR+1, {Knockdown, Improved Knockdown}, (STR=20)<br/>\n09: Monk(7): Ambidexterity<br/>\n10: Champion of Torm(1)<br/>\n11: Champion of Torm(2): Two-Weapon Fighting<br/>\n12: Monk(8): STR+1, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, (STR=21)<br/>\n13: Champion of Torm(3): {Smite Evil}<br/>\n14: Monk(9): {Improved Evasion}<br/>\n15: Fighter(3): Iron Will<br/>\n16: Champion of Torm(4): STR+1, Improved Critical: Kama, (STR=22)<br/>\n17: Monk(10)<br/>\n18: Fighter(4): Toughness, Weapon Specialization: Kama<br/>\n19: Monk(11)<br/>\n20: Monk(12): STR+1, (STR=23)<br/>\n21: Champion of Torm(5): Epic Weapon Focus: Kama<br/>\n22: Monk(13)<br/>\n23: Champion of Torm(6): Epic Weapon Specialization: Kama<br/>\n24: Monk(14): STR+1, Great Strength I, (STR=25)<br/>\n25: Monk(15)<br/>\n26: Monk(16)<br/>\n27: Monk(17): Overwhelming Critical: Kama<br/>\n28: Monk(18): STR+1, (STR=26)<br/>\n29: Monk(19)<br/>\n30: Monk(20): Devastating Critical: Kama<br/>\n31: Monk(21)<br/>\n32: Monk(22): STR+1, (STR=27)<br/>\n33: Monk(23): Great Strength II, (STR=28)<br/>\n34: Monk(24)<br/>\n35: Monk(25): Improved Spell Resistance I<br/>\n36: Monk(26): STR+1, Great Strength III, (STR=30)<br/>\n37: Monk(27)<br/>\n38: Monk(28)<br/>\n39: Monk(29): Great Strength IV, (STR=31)<br/>\n40: Monk(30): STR+1, Improved Spell Resistance II, (STR=32)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHitpoints: 460<br/>\nSkillpoints: 152<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 32/25/30<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +3, Mind Effects: +2<br/>\nBAB: 27<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 41 (melee), 30 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 27/30<br/>\nSpell Casting: <br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nConcentration 39(41), Discipline 43(54), Spellcraft 15(15), Tumble 40(43)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>\n01: Concentration(1), Discipline(4), Spellcraft(2), Tumble(4), Save(3), \n03: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(2), Save(1), \n05: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Tumble(2), Save(1), \n07: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Tumble(1), Save(1), \n09: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Tumble(1), Save(1), \n11: Discipline(1), Save(1), \n13: Discipline(1), Save(1), \n15: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Save(1), \n17: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Tumble(3), Save(1), \n19: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Tumble(2), Save(1), \n21: Discipline(1), Save(3), \n23: Discipline(1), Save(2), \n25: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Tumble(1), Save(1), \n27: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Tumble(1), Save(1), \n29: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Tumble(1), Save(1), \n31: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Tumble(1), Save(1), \n33: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Tumble(1), Save(1), \n35: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Tumble(1), Save(1), \n37: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Tumble(1), Save(1), \n39: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Save(3), </details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
