      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi, Mick (and/or others, of course),<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm loath to ask this, given the stupendosity (-iciousness?) of this build, but I'm in the midst of trying to convert someone to NwN. We've agreed to join a PW with 2 characters I'm currently test-driving through Aielund, but he wants to try a run-through in SP first. He doesn't want to do the OC or SoU/HotU (it was he who first gave me the discs, having got fed up in Chapter 1 of the OC and never returned to it), so I figured Aielund would be a good idea. He's even more of a non-caster than I am (trying to change that currently), as well as a meleer moving from BG and IWD, and he's not a fan of the radial system. Thus, this looks to be the ideal build for him, except...<br/>\n<br/>\n Aielund's a non-Dev Crit environment, and stops at level 36. So, what would you recommend?\u00a0 Losing OW and Dev Crits don't seem too hard, given that I'll be losing a Feat and a Bonus Feat anyway, and I'll be losing 5 Tumbles (pushing Monk 3 up to L32) whether I bring Monk 4 into pre-L36 or not. But would you replace some of the Fighter levels with the lost CoT ones in epic or not? My maths (sorry, British) is letting me down. I would guess yes, but thought I'd ask. Pre-epic, I can bin Great Cleave with no problem and whack Imp Crit: Heavy Flail in its place, which is grand.<br/>\n<br/>\n I don't like messing with quality, but I want him to enjoy as much as possible - else he'll go back to Morrowind. I'm trying to grow some support here <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Then in epic, try to make it to Monk 12 to get the only thing missing from the build... SR.\u00a0 And there's simply nothing better than monk SR, right?\u00a0 Just an idea that popped out of the air.<br/>\n<br/>\n But, with all that said... I think you should stick with the double weapon specialization.\u00a0 Reason:\u00a0 Besides the alternate damage type being VERY handy, your disarm attempts won't be nearly as successful with the scimi so all attempts should be made with the large weapon.\u00a0 But the s/s switch is also important if the AC isn't cutting it without a shield.\u00a0 The only combat feat missing that I generally use in my fighters are called arm shots which can effectively increase your AC significantly and stacks with itself.\u00a0 But called shots are not modal so require some management that your friend may not care to engage in, regardless of its effectiveness.\u00a0 Sort of like a monk using stunning fists, also not modal.<br/>\n<br/>\n BTW, your friend has good instincts.\u00a0 Why waste an opportunity to learn party tactics on the silly-easy OC?\u00a0 That won't help on-line play anywhere.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Aielund is really not all that hard either, but the story should help to keep him interested.\u00a0 You didn't specify what sort of PW, Stagmeister.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n If it's a server heavy on RP, Aielund is a very good training ground.\u00a0 But if it's more geared towards action with quickly-respawning encounters, a more combat-oriented campaign would be better, something like HotU but more challenging.\u00a0 Typically, those sorts have little plot immersion.\u00a0 Don't ask me to recommend any combat-heavy modules because the last one I played was Infinite Dungeons and after that I began building epic trainers myself.\u00a0 But I am sure they are out there, languishing in the Vault somewhere, because encounters are the easiest features to script.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Effectively that's 50% of epic levels in Aielund as Monk. Me, I'd like it - and it covers KDown and its improved cousin (which, as we all know, I'm stupid enough not to use ordinarily), thereby freeing up a couple of pre-epic feats as well as SR. But he's not me (I'm not doing the classic, \"I've got a friend with a problem,\" promise!), and he still won't be able to max Tumble, which will be all his concern - unless he starts thinking about shedding armour for robes! Remember, he's a newb who's never gone beyond level 6 in the OC. I might play with it myself, however...<br/>\n<br/>\n 2. Dimness - \"s/s switch\"? Oh, hang on, sword and shield, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n 3. No, 'cos I don't know. I'd certainly much prefer RP. No issues with combat, per se, but character development and plot are much more enticing. Combat, if you're doing it right, is just another way to get you to something more interesting, not an end in itself. That's my view, and I doubt Billy's would be different. Thus, any thoughts you might have would be welcome. Equally, how to enter a PW and what sort of things to expect would be handy!<br/>\n<br/>\n It's just want, want, want with me, isn't it?

Some times a creature will have intrinsic feats attached to their weapon, like +AC, ability/skill boosts or even Permahaste.\u00a0 If one hit can disable those advantages, it well worth the investment.\u00a0 IMO, if one is planning disarm attempts, either use a large weapon with ImpDisarm or just stick to KD/IKD or Called Shots to level the playing field.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Thank you. What was the line - keep it simple, stupid? I'll just lose a touch in AB and AC along with Saves, much of which was going to happen anyway if the build stops at 36, and throwing away a feat or two for the sake of already excellent saves seems a bit wasteful. Of course, the debate about variations from the original is perfectly legitimate, but I reckon I'll go with this for Billy (including dropping Great Cleave for Imp Crit in Heavy Flail in pre-epic).<br/>\n<br/>\n A piercing dagger, indeed.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks, everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Sorry, it was one of my own MUAs (Made Up Acronyms) - so about as far from being hipster slang as you can get.<br/>\n<br/>\n I meant to include this earlier, but got distracted. In case you're interested, my final adaptations for Billy were:<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Pre-epic</strong>. Kept all the class splits as is. Pushed Expertise back to L3 and took Weapon Prof: Exotic in at L1 (gives even more freedom of weaponry, and you'll never hit anything with Expertise on for the first level or 2). This meant taking Knockdown at L6. I put Imp Crit: Heavy Flail in at L12 and dropped Imp Knockdown down to L15, with Blind Fighting sneaking in at L14. From this, you will gather that I dropped both the Disarm feats (following earlier contributions on this thread) - I went for Called Shot instead, which resides at L19 in place of Great Cleave. Hope that sounds reasonable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Epic</strong>. (Please remember that these tweaks were for a level 36 build). Made L22 EWF: Heavy Flail, then L24 EWS: Scimitar and L26 EWS: Heavy Flail. Epic Prowess went in at L29, and Armour Skin at L31. I then swapped a CoT level for one of Monk at L32, so I'd only lose 5 points of Tumble by L36. This meant that CoT 14 now comes in at L36, and I must confess that I'm at a bit of a loss as to what to take as the Bonus Feat there. Any thoughts would be welcome. I wondered about Epic Energy Resistance or Epic Skill Focus in either Discipline or Spellcraft, but I remain a little unclear as to whether I could take either without their baby versions (or indeed at all, for EER), and whether ESkF in Spellcraft would make a blind bit of difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n Hope I haven't wrecked your build, Mick.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks a lot, y'all <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
