Invisibility, Knock, Clarity, Stoneskin, ILMS, etc.<br/>\nSuper High Spot Score (buffed is 62)<br/>\nMost of AC is natural and not Dodge-based, so no need for Uncanny Dodge<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>Builder\u2019s Commentary</strong><br/>\nThis is hardly a new concept, but this particular archer holds a bit of uniqueness in contrast with other Zen Archer builds.\u00a0 In my attempts to arrive at the ultimate divine damage dealing archer, I was always dismayed at how soft they were in the middle.\u00a0 This stemmed from the fact they were Dex and Charisma beings, and so lost all of their dodge AC, to include their dex AC, when flatfooted, being flanked in combat, etc.\u00a0 Because of my solo playstyle, I decided to go another route.\u00a0 Using the Monk/Wisdom/Zen Archery approach, I was able to cast aside the need for Dexterity and Uncanny Dodge, and stand in the midst of combat jamming arrows down the throats of mine enemy.\u00a0 Indeed, in going Zen one can also cast aside Weapon Finesse.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nMy other goal was to make the most of the wizard class taking up a class slot, so by going 7 Wizard, one can use the free wizard feat for Craft Wand, and then have a wand for every occasion: Wands of Breach, Wands of Improved Invis, Wands of Invis, and my favorite, Wands of Remove Blindness to counter the Words of Faith spam of which I sometimes fall victim to.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nThe AB is well high enough that you will only miss on rolls of 1 (with a few boss exceptions), and the AC climbs and stays commensurate with the AB.\u00a0 The high spot score ensures no one is sneaking up on you, and Called Shot: Leg becomes your modus operandi when facing big foes.\u00a0 The more you land, the more you land, if you catch my meaning.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nOne is free to move skill points around, though Tumble and Spot are a must, and I found keeping Hide and Move Silently was handy.\u00a0 Discipline is a toss-up, but I ran into a creature that had On Hit: Ruin Armor, and I quickly found myself naked in combat against a beast from the abyss.\u00a0 The only defense against such attacks is a high discipline, so I decided to err on the side of caution and pump that as well (nobody teaches that at the academy, but Ruin Armor can ruin your day and is a good argument for Discipline, so judge your environment accordingly).<br/>\n\u00a0\n<ol>\n<li><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build203926.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Death by
