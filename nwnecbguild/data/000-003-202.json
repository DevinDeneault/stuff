Race doesnt matter to me but I am guess Human is best? I have never really tried a pally\u00a0so not sure of the starting stats or anything would be. If anyone has any ideas or can lay it out for me I would really appreciate it,thanks. The Alignment Change will not be hard to get as well.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You get the Paladin spellbook open quickly, but miss out on free cleave, evasion, tumble dumps, etc., plus cannot max taunt.<br/>\n<br/>\n The playablility build (IMO) is <br/>\n 1 PAL <br/>\n 2 MO (cleave and 5 hide for BG)<br/>\n 3 PAL<br/>\n 4 PAL<br/>\n 5 PAL<br/>\n 6 PAL<br/>\n 7 MO<br/>\n 8 BG (alignment shift)<br/>\n 9 BG - dark blessing so you double cha bonus to saves<br/>\n 10 BG <br/>\n 11 BG - sneak<br/>\n 12 MO<br/>\n 13 PAL (last alignment shift)<br/>\n 14 PAL<br/>\n 15 PAL<br/>\n 16 PAL<br/>\n 17 MO<br/>\n 18 PAL<br/>\n 19 PAL<br/>\n 20 PAL<br/>\n<br/>\n And then in Epic, its 16 MO 4 PAL in any order, depending on where you want certain bonus feats.<br/>\n<br/>\n If you start <br/>\n<br/>\n STR - 14 (all increases here)<br/>\n DEX - 10<br/>\n CON - 14<br/>\n WIS - 14<br/>\n INT - 12<br/>\n CHA - 14<br/>\n<br/>\n You'd look AB 40 with no GR STR feats and WF/EWF/EP.  You'll have stacking Bull's with PAL &amp; BG, Bless, Aid, GMW and (vs evil) Holy Sword &amp; Smite Evil as decent buffs,<br/>\n<br/>\n The best monk stuff (Empty Body, Perfect Self) comes extremely late, but he should be a tough cookie.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
