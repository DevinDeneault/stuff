Everything is environment dependant, but it remains true that in general there is no meaningful difference between short sword and dagger. In SP the lack of good daggers can be fixed, in MP one can ask to fix it. It's plain silly to have +7 short swords and just +3 daggers around...<br/>\n<blockquote><div>But if there are good of both, I guess you're right.

The more you have, the longer you can fight before having to swallow a heal potion (which conversely is worth more to someone having higher HPs). Think of a normal heal potion, not of a 150 or 250 Hps capped one.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoughly speaking (as a rule of thumb) I want my meleers to get 400+ HPs and my casters to get 300+ HPs. In the case of a very defensive build one can accommodate for lower HPs (my pale sneaker of doom Rogue/PM with ED, SCV and crit immunity has 338 HPs eg) but this guy would be getting less than 300 HPs (282 to be precise) if he were to drop CON by 2 points. That's way too little for me. His 322 points are already lower than desired.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I had actually edited ED to lvl 27, and asked if you could do it on an assassin lvl, otherwise I must shuffle lvls 24 and 27, which doesn't really matter. then I had to restart the post and forgot. Halflings also better stealth (hide) than elves. A build like this has no bonus feats before epic, which hurts a lot. where I played it was possible to relevel once or twice, so I took SD1 as early as I could and releveled at 21. If not, taking it early is probably worth it. As for the hp's, 322 is just as good as 400+ in a lower AC build. Besides, there's nothing one can do to get more hitpoints that is worth doing. Without SC V you'll have enough feats to start with 19 DEX.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Just that.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>Besides, there's nothing one can do to get more hitpoints that is worth doing.

End at Dex 34, Con 16 and get +1 AB, +3 AC, +40 HPs, +1 Fort/Ref save and +1 dmg and a little more carrying capacity.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
