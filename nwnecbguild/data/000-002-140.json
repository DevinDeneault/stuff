We recommend cloning one of the existing caster classes and then start customising from there. When adding spellcasting to new classes, remember to also update existing columns.<br/>\nThere is also a new ruleset entry: COMPANION_LEVELS_STACK, defaulting to 0.<br/>\n</div></blockquote>\n\nThis one *IS* a game changer for us here.\u00a0 Once the dust settles, and we know precisely what does and what does not work, a LOT of things will need reworking and consideration!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a great time to be a NWN Character Builder!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I updated to 1.80 last night and noticed a bug during character creation.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen making a non-caster class (Barb, Figh, Monk, Rog) you can't lower STR below 11 (including racial modifiers) once you have increased it. You can leave it at the base 6/8/10 with no issues, but once you have increased it it's not possible to decrease it to below 11. I assume that this is due to non-caster classes having their casting ability set to STR in the updated 2da files, but I haven't looked at them so I might be wrong. For anybody else dealing with this bug, reselecting your class resets your ability increases.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas anybody else experienced this bug?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
