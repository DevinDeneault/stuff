      "content": "<div><strong>The Dexterity Rogue PvM Solo Early Game</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nThere's been a few dexterity rogues posted in the forum recently and I've been playing a few<br/>\nThe early game is possibly the hardest part of such builds. Perhaps.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I thought I would put up for discussion things I'm doing when playing these builds in PvM solo, and things I'm unsure about.<br/>\nDelighted to hear any comments.<br/>\nMaybe you guys have different survival strategies<br/>\nI did a search for rogue guides and this appears to be <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/nwn-character-class-guides-an-attempt-at-a-compreh-t2355107.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a bit of a gap</a>, the best I could find was Hip's 3 pure yardstick rogue 40 builds with strategies, and a pre-epic rogue guide for NWN.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Weapon Finesse<br/>\n-&gt; I aim to get this ASAP. Either Level 1-2 (ie with Fighter 1 at level 2 as a bonus feat) or Level 3 (other builds).\u00a0<br/>\n-&gt; Before I get this feat I use a ranged weapon, my go to early game is the Heavy Crossbow for the extra damage (1d10 19-20/x2)<br/>\n-&gt; even when I get this, I like to make sure my HP and AC is good enough to melee before I commit to it, otherwise I am still using my ranged weapon. If I can die to a critical hit, or get knocked down and die in a round, I'm not going to want to melee.<br/>\n-&gt; once I get BAB 6+ I switch from Heavy Crossbow to Shortbow (or Longbow if Elf/Martial, Sling perhaps if Halfling) if I am still using a ranged weapon but usually by then I have switched to Melee<br/>\n-&gt; small and large shields are quite useful if access is available to them. when AB is higher dual wielding is extremely attractive<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Stealth / Detection<br/>\n-&gt; Seeing things before they see you (scouting) is very important hence high spot (or listen) + stealth is very important<br/>\n-&gt; you can then plan a strategy well before you engage, giving you a tactical advantage<br/>\n-&gt; I aim to max these asap<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Traps<br/>\n-&gt; 1 rank in Set Trap is enough for the early game. Minor electrical/fire traps can be set with Set Trap 0 (modified), and average electrical/fire traps with Set Trap 5 (modified).<br/>\n-&gt; I like some search to detect traps but not overboard<br/>\n-&gt; I like to put a decent amount early into disable trap. The big nasty traps are minor/average electrical and minor/average fire which have a base disarm DC of 26 +the skill of the setter, (at least until you have an ultra high reflex save with evasion/improved evasion). Retrieving traps is pretty hard low levels with the +10 modifier but more realistic perhaps mid to late pre-epic<br/>\n-&gt; Craft trap sometimes I put a few ranks sometimes I don't, it depends on whether there are 1. components 2. equipment which adds to craft trap skill (ie Lesser Ring of Trap Creation +5, Gloves of the Artificer +3 etc etc). If there aren't components its not worth investing much in this at all. Even if there are, sometimes equipment + fox's cunning potion can boost the score enough to make minors and average traps to help you through the hard early game.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Generating Sneaks<br/>\n-&gt; Stealth + Sneak Attack with a ranged weapon early game is my go to<br/>\n-&gt; Even later on this is good until one dual wields and gets 4+ APR faster (for 2-3 attack flurries with dual wielding)<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Use Magical Device<br/>\n-&gt; This I view as my 'cheat' ability<br/>\n-&gt; Wands of Magic Missile will help one hit opponents you normally cannot hit, and Beamdog has recently patched this so it is cheap to buy<br/>\n-&gt; Certain summon spells are great early game, Animate Dead for Tyrantfog Zombie has great +1 damage soak, Wands with Summon IV are fabulous<br/>\n-&gt; Wands of fire are ok, I like Wands of the Heavens for flame strike though<br/>\n-&gt; Low level scrolls such as Bless Weapon (+2d6 divine vs undead!), Mage Armor, Ghostly Visage can be very helpful<br/>\n<br/>\n6. Improved Knockdown<br/>\n-&gt; I want to get this on all melee dex rogues, there are just circumstances solo where one cannot flank or stealthily sneak attack<br/>\n<br/>\nEarly Leveling<br/>\n-&gt; Rogue / Fighter I like to go Rogue 1 -&gt; Fighter 1-2 (weapon finesse + extra feat), then Rogue 2-3 for 2d6 sneak attack/uncanny dodge/evasion asap. More sneak attack damage = more power in general<br/>\n-&gt; Similar idea with Rogue / Paladin, Rogue 1 -&gt; Paladin 1-2 (disease/fear immunity/divine grace/lay on hands), then rogue 2-3 as above, more rogue more power<br/>\n-&gt; Haven't done a Rogue/Ranger yet, I assume Rogue 1-&gt;Ranger 1 then Rogue 2-3 then whatever you want to do<br/>\n<br/>\nStats<br/>\n-&gt; High dex, Int 14 makes sense to me<br/>\n-&gt; Con 12-16 also makes sense if you want to melee, I like HP<br/>\n-&gt; Str vs Dex balance is tricky for me. I like Str 14 to help with encumbrance and a little non-sneak damage but I can see the appeal of dumping it to 10 or even 8 to max out Dex, just means one will go searching for good bags to reduce encumberance and items to boost Str more urgently. Perhaps Str is kind of a luxury type stat for a Dex Rogue<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway this looks like enough text &amp; thoughts for now, anyway keen to keep learning + improving\u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>Those are the rules I follow, mostly.  A few more from my list for review:<br/>\n1. I specifically take Knockdown/Improved Knockdown AFTER BAB 6.<br/>\n2. Use a shield early on Dual Weapon Dexers until your AB is high enough to dual and to take dual weapon feats.<br/>\n3. People focus on early sneak Damage.  This is 100% correct for grouping characters and not unreasonable for the early Missile weapon game when soloing.  However, I tend to find Weapon Spec more useful as it is not situational damage.  Sneak Damage is situational through the whole game, but really comes into its power when you have more CC options.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, a caution/suggestion ... much of this approach and others is heavily dependant on the PW.  This is effective on WoG, on Arelith and Blackstone, the approach is very different.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hey Zanithar<br/>\nThanks for the reply<br/>\n<br/>\nKnockdown after 2+ APR/round is certainly valuable solo<br/>\nRogues get this earlier than most if they dual wield, if they have an ultra high dex score (ie 18-20 starting dex) I *think* it is viable to even get knockdown early<br/>\nEspecially if you buff yourself with Cats, Bless/Aid etc<br/>\nIf they are knocked down enemies get their Dex/Dodge/Tumble AC destroyed so it might be effective +3-5 AB if they are on the floor perhaps?<br/>\nKnockdown with 1 APR is valuable in parties or if you have a summon with UMD/Cleric etc.\u00a0<br/>\nSometimes I wonder if it is valuable solo with 1 APR? Like if you knock them down, then you get your next attack in the next round with them flatfooted? Often they still get their attack in before I get a chance to knock them down again (meaning they aren't flatfooted again) so I don't think it is. Perhaps it is useful against a caster, but then a self-targeted silence scroll might be more effective.<br/>\n<br/>\nI certainly appreciate Weapon Spec/EWS for sure I like to rush it after 2d6 sneak (I wouldn't get any more sneak before WS unless there are exp penalties or something to consider), getting it earlier is good too. I think you are right re the sneak+2d6 with the ranged weapon, that is the reason why I like it, I don't really like to melee early with my rogues due to the low hit die, but other environments might be safer to do so. That being said the fighter 4 levels is d10 hit die... so heh :) go figure maybe both work fine with adjusted playstyles</div>"

Sometimes the AI will pause when recovering from Knockdown, usually when it attempts to cast a spell or switch weapons, but if it's solely melee attacking then there's no pause. If you have both 1 APR and HiPS then it can work, but if you're qualified for Shadowdancer then you're probably close to 2 APR anyway.</div>"

I think humans and dwarves are good too they avoid a lot of multiclass penalties more easily than elf, and have some other nice features depending what you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking forward to what others think.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Interesting post. A few things I guess to add:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. BAB and taking HIPS early.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaking HIPS early is only really an issue if you\u2019re planning on playing a class split that gains and extra attack with BAB 16 at level 20, such as Rogue/Fighter/SD. Missing out on 1 BAB point for a Rogue by itself doesn\u2019t mean that much, but missing out on a whole attack does. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf one plans on making a build like this, then to get BAB 16, they will have to index more heavily into SD early (eg Rogue 12 Ft 4 SD 4, usually this is more common on Monk/SD\u2019s) or index more heavily into a high BAB class early (Rogue 12 Fighter 7 SD 1).<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Corner Sneaking.<br/>\n<br/>\nCorner sneaking is basically making use of nearby terrain to hide behind (usually \u2018corners\u2019 in buildings, hence the name). Pre-HIPS, this is invaluable. This is most easily done with Monks as they have access to extra movement speed, but any stealth character can make use of this. On a pre-epic Rogue, this is particularly effective when combined with:<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Mastery Over the Ranged Sneak Attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nRanged Sneak attacks work over a distance of 30ft. In game terms, this is a little more than the diameter of a typical Mummy Fear Aura, or around about the radius of a Dragon Fear Aura. <br/>\n<br/>\nLearn this distance. It\u2019s really frickin useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn easy way to learn it is to engage on stationary targets from range when coming out of stealth, then running away to stealth behind terrain and trying again. Try doing this at different ranges, until sneak attacks stop working (which they won\u2019t, beyond 30ft). <br/>\n<br/>\nOnce you feel comfortable that you know what \u201830ft between your target\u2019 is, use this as a tether. Done properly, and combined with corner sneaking, it is near impossible for melee foes at early levels to reach you. Take a mid-range sneak attack pot shot coming out of stealth at an enemy, run behind some terrain to stealth (or use HIPS if you have the luxury), rinse and repeat.</div>"

A halfling would get to add +1 to AB from small stature.<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/202004/10759084_976c737832e0d254dda5d7ec22abe715_t.jpg\"/><br/>\n<br/>\nAlso as a follow up to the 1 APR knockdown thingo. Obviously a 1 APR knockdown is good in parties or if you have summons/familiar/animal to also hit the opponent<br/>\nBut as Yunim noted often the opponent gets an attack in before you can knock them down again, it is less useful without these features in PvM<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly if you get an excellent initiative roll, I have found that sometimes one can consistently knockdown an opponent without them being able to get an attack in when they stand up.<br/>\nSo you can keep them on the floor without receiving much damage. With a poor initiative roll they seemed to get attacks in more frequently before I can try to knock them down again.<br/>\nProbably most relevant for dexers as they seem to have excellent initiative rolls (haven't looked up the exact mechanics in the Wiki yet), and take a while to kill opponents which are sneak immune<br/>\nThought this would be a nice observation to share. Repeated 1 APR knockdown solo might be useful if you roll high with initiative. Roll low with initiative - don't bother.</div>"
