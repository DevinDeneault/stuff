Best to ask on BSN for confirmation but I think so, sorry.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I can confirm Shia's response.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEssentially, each patch upgrade creates a brand new game so you will be playing with the most current configuration and balanced as best as it could be when Bioware staffers dropped the support.   I personally found it interesting to revisit some of the older content after v1.69 was installed to see how it affected game play.  Sometimes the changes are blatantly obvious and other times very subtle.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best news is:  about 90% of all the newest and most creative custom content and PWs will now be available...  as is all versions of the CEP, as well.  It's still 100% downward compatible though, so you can play all content designed with lesser versions just as before.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I experimented, and successfully loaded a saved game. Apparently, the answer to my question is no: upgrading from 1.68 to 1.69 does not break saved games.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
