I have come for your help in a problem I have run into, as such I should go onto explain some things, before I go into anything I want to make, I should probably go into what's changed on the server I chose to play on (only one I could find, but it shall be good regardless) <ul><li>A Level 30 server named Arelith.</li> <li>Class changes are mostly none existence except sub-classes Bard gains warlock etc, but this is not my intent, though you can get gifts that do different things</li> <li>It seems AA, BG, DC, DD, SD, and WM are free reign, the others require permission, as such I would like to remain in these if needed.</li> </ul> Now here comes the long part, I've played a warrior, mage, and that was all fun. But, I decided to take a route less traveled. I wanted to make a support character, I suppose I should go on, I wanted to make a bard, but wondered if a pure bard was a bad idea, now here are some bullets though I know somethings have a negative impact perhaps. <ul><li>I wanted to make it a dwarf regardless of the current situation of it getting a -2 to its CHA.</li> <li>I have no specific weapon in mind actually, so that itself would be free reign.</li> <li>I wanted it to be capable of support, so I'm not looking for a solo major big number one shotting paladin. Some survivability solo would be nice, but it's majority, I would like to focus on buffing, (and if possible healing)</li> <li>I did not know if leaving it a pure bard would be good or not, I've read the guides here and while informative, that multiple classes can be better than a pure one, this can sometimes be a rare case, not many people I see aren't wanting a power build.</li> </ul> Now whilst I said all that there are a few things I did want to say beforehand, they aren't really necessary to the character itself but, <ul><li>I don't want a build handed to me, I may not know the ways of making one, but I'd rather be apart of making my character (if someone is willing to teach me all the better). Getting a build tossed at me is no fun in comparison to at least helping forge it myself.</li> <li>I'm not looking for the Ultimate Build, as there is no such thing, I'm looking for help to create something with practical use in PvE, and PvP.</li> </ul> If I missed giving any information that is needed please tell me, and I look forward to discussing it with you all.</div>"

Giving undispellable spells (Minus that Mordenkainen's disjunction if that can dispel it, which worries me because I hear people can just put that on a wand and have it 24/7. And if such what is your recommedation for the last 6 levels? I was thinking bards can be lawful apparently (after creation) So, I was thinking monk, but then a Sorcerer might better benefit from it as well correct? Seeing as it may potentially bring in spells I don't have, whilst also gaining from CHA much like the bard. If they can be powerful allies in combat, it still reigns as support to me, I just wanted to try something different from the pew pew magic missles, pew pew arrows, cut cut pure sword brute.</div></div>"

Perhaps, it might be wise to test out a pure bard and see what's what, before deciding the best way to cut out, and see what's capable of going alongside it in synch, it seems 24 levels would help greatly, I found some new knowledge myself, making a wand with MD is expensive, very much so to the point unless someone is exploiting they likely won't have more than one, it's a danger, but lots of other mages seem to love their other dispels in favor of saving the final spells for more variety. Would the OC, or other three campaigns be suitable testing grounds or?</div></div>"

It seemed to go well to an extent, it's usefulness is undeniable, but it's versatility as a pure bard is woefully lacking. It will likely need to be cut off at some point, I've yet to find a perfect way to mesh that, from the looks of it, without going a fighter/bard hybrid, those six other levels would definitely be crucial. From the knowledge I've gathered everyone doesn't seem to bother will low level dispels, rather they go with MD around 95% of the time. The breach will be a big problem, but the spells on both sides limited, it will be quite troublesome to find something optimal.</div></div>"

I thought about healing, but then if people can just buy potions of heal, to fully restore themselves I don't think that's as viable as I would like. I mean it could be, I think clerics have ressurrection, but they also have scrolls, though expensive.Is there even such a thing as a support ...wizard? I'm opening up my options quite a bit actually, I still do want a support character, but maybe the 'buff-bot' isn't what I'D have fun playing.
