      "content": "<div>I want to thank Valerfor, and the others for being patient with me, and helping me in where I haven't really gained any knowledge (creating builds). My friend wanted me to play a server called Amia (alongside my arelith time.) and I would like to request a little help in that regard since it's a whole new system. I would like to try and go for the necromancer. Classes such as Palemaster do not seem to be restricted in choice so long as you meet the bare requirements.<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#FF0000\">Caster Level:</span><br/>\n Palemaster levels are counted toward the caster's level when casting spells of the Necromancy school, provided they are arcane in origin (divine-only spells are not affected by this). This includes damage, duration and casting level for the purposes of piercing spell resistance, though due to engine limitations, monk spell resistance is not affected.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#FF0000\">Undead Grafts:</span><br/>\n The Palemaster has access to an extended selection of undead grafts in order to strengthen their deathless arts. <ul><li><span style=\"color:#FFBF40\">Paralyzing Touch</span><br/>\n<em>6 Palemaster levels</em><br/>\n Paralysis on melee touch attack. Fortitude Save at DC 10 + INT mod + PM level, with a duration of round/Palemaster level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#FFBF40\">Weakening Touch</span><br/>\n<em>6 Palemaster levels</em><br/>\n 1d6 STR damage on melee touch attack, Fortitude Save at DC 10 + int mod + PM level. Lasts 1 hour/Palemaster level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#FFBF40\">Degenerative Touch</span><br/>\n<em>7 Palemaster levels</em><br/>\n Level Drain of 1 level on melee touch attack, Fortitude Save at DC 10 + int mod + PM level. Lasts 1 hour/Palemaster level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#FFBF40\">Commanding Touch</span><br/>\n<em>8 Palemaster levels</em><br/>\n As \"Control Undead\" on melee touch attack, with caster level (wizard + sorcerer + PM levels), lasting for (wizard + sorcerer + PM level) rounds. Will Save at DC 10 + int mod + PM level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#FFBF40\">Destructive Touch</span><br/>\n<em>9 Palemaster levels</em><br/>\n 1d6 CON damage on melee touch attack, Fortitude Save at DC 10 + int mod + PM level, successful save negates CON damage. Lasts 1 hour/Palemaster level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#FFBF40\">Deathless Touch</span><br/>\n<em>10 Palemaster levels</em><br/>\n Death on melee touch attack. Fortitude Save at DC 10 + INT mod + PM level.<br/>\n<br/>\n These would be the class changes from the looks of it, but I need a little guidance.<br/>\n<br/>\n Edit: Also appears to be no class taking limit like 3 levels before switch etc.</li> </ul></div>"

Having the ability for stronger summons hardly matters if the A.I isn't up to the task for example. And all that i see are flavour changes, that won't increase your build's power. You might think these changes are cool and funny to role-play but all a trained eye sees are distactions to make you invest on more pale-master levels than you need for. And in a Level 30 environment taking pale-master at all is going to be a tough undertaking.</div>"

Having the ability for stronger summons hardly matters if the A.I isn't up to the task for example. And all that i see are flavour changes, that won't increase your build's power. You might think these changes are cool and funny to role-play but all a trained eye sees are distactions to make you invest on more pale-master levels than you need for. And in a Level 30 environment taking pale-master at all is going to be a tough undertaking.</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">Yeah, I understand. It is all for roleplay as well ^^. But, that's the why I'm leaving your decision in your capable hands ^^ I know you guys are \"trained eyes\" Which is perfectly fine, but only have 30 levels I'm limited to my ideas to little and you don't get enough, to much and it becomes a burden. ^^</div></div>"

In order to gain any abilities on PrC classes you have to take them at least twice it seems to get the first ability. On top of that the BG has to search for NPC's all over the world to just get their abilities while being at a certain level.</div></div>"

It also prevents travel to any <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Portals\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">portals</a> within the area.</li> </ul><strong>Spell Focus: Conjuration</strong> <ul><li>Each Spell Focus in Conjuration grants a small bonus to the statistics of creatures summoned by the [Lesser/Greater] Planar Binding Spells, and Epic Spell: Dragon Knight.</li> <li>Greater Spell Focus: Conjuration causes a caster to summon a creature one \"level\" higher than normal when using the Summon Creature I-VIII spells, in the same way as the bonus provided by the Cleric's Animal <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Animal_domain%7CAnimal\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Domain</a>. Note that Animal Domain and Greater Spell Focus: Conjuration <em><strong>do not</strong></em> stack in this respect. This feat will also grant <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Warlock#Fiendish_Summons\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Fiendish Warlocks</a> an empowered version of their final summon, and allows Summon Creature IX to summon a more powerful Ancient Elemental.</li> <li>Epic Spell Focus: Conjuration enables the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Console_command#-yoink\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">-yoink</a> command. Once per rest, a character may send -yoink as a tell to another PC, which will cause them to enter a dialogue telling them that your PC is attempting to summon them. If they accept, they are transported instantly to your location.</li> </ul><strong>Spell Focus: Divination</strong> <ul><li>Spell Focus: Divination allows a character using the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Look\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">*looks*</a> command to see whether a character is \"attuned\" to Life, Death, Fire, Water, Earth, or Air. This information is displayed even if the target is disguised. Through trial and error association, a player may learn much about another character's habits and abilities from their attunement. Also allows a character to use the mysterious and rare Deck of Stars item.</li> <li>With Epic Spell Focus: Divination, the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Console_command#-scry\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">-scry</a> command becomes available. Once per rest, with the Clairaudience/Clairvoyance spell active, the character may send -scry as a tell to another PC (or type -scry [START OF TARGET'S NAME]). This permits the character to spy on their target for roughly one minute. It is possible to protect against this, but means of doing so are considered <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/w/index.php?title=Find_Out_In_Game&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find Out In Game</a> information.</li> </ul><strong>Spell Focus: Enchantment</strong> <ul><li>Each Spell Focus in Enchantment reduces the base cost of an enchantment when using the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/w/index.php?title=Enchantment_Basin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Enchantment Basin</a>. This, in turn, means the chances of success with any given enchantment are increased, and that more valuable/powerful items can be created.</li> <li>The (non-cumulative) reduction in costs are 10% for Spell Focus, 20% for Greater Spell Focus, and 35% for Epic Spell Focus.</li> </ul><strong>Spell Focus: Evocation</strong> <ul><li>Epic Spell Focus: Evocation drastically improves both <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Greater_ruin\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Spell: Greater Ruin</a> and <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Hellball\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Spell: Hellball</a>, to several times their normal effectiveness. Without this focus, their power is equivalent to Vanilla NWN.</li> </ul><strong>Spell Focus: Illusion</strong> <ul><li>Epic Spell Focus: Illusion enables the -send_image command. Once per rest, the character may send -send_image XXXX as a tell to another PC (or type -send_image [START OF TARGET'S NAME] XXXX), where \"XXXX\" is the message they wish to send. Your character's avatar, with the appropriate <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Console_command#Other_emotes\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">*conjures* or *casts* visual</a> and/or polymorph state, will appear like a <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/w/index.php?title=Speedy_Messenger&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Speedy Messenger</a> beside the target and relate your message. If you are targeting a PC on a different server, they will instead see only a \"Mysterious Ball of Light\".</li> </ul><strong>Spell Focus: Necromancy</strong> <ul><li>Greater Spell Focus: Necromancy turns Summoned Undead (from any Spell, Class Ability or Feat except Epic Spell: Mummy Dust) into Henchmen. Your character may therefore use such an ability twice (or two such abilities once), and have two undead at the same time. You may also have a normally summoned creature in addition to those two.</li> <li>Epic Spell Focus: Necromancy means that all abilities which summon undead summon two, with one casting.</li> </ul><strong>Spell Focus: Transmutation</strong> <ul><li>Greater Spell Focus: Transmutation allows a character, by travelling to the correct place (the location of which is <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/w/index.php?title=Find_Out_In_Game&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Find Out In Game</a> information), to activate Golems from their constituent parts so long as the character is Level 15 or over.</li> <li>Epic Spell Focus: Transmutation enables the -teleport command. This allows the character to open the same dialogue they receive at an One-Way Entrance or Two-Way <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Portals\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Portal</a>. Once per rest, they may select one of these at a cost of 5 <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Spell_components\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Spell components</a>, and travel there as if using a portal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n This looks like all the changes took a big to type and edit, word from word...before I realized I could have copy and pasted it x.x. But, out of these do you still think necromancy is best? Because, necromancy on that server will get like 50 guys coming to kill you x.x if they see you summon undead and such xD</li> </ul></div></div>"

      "content": "<div>Hey man!<br/>\n<br/>\n It's hard to say because I haven't played there to actually see it happening and know which things are useful and which things are not. The focus in Necromancy is traditional for regular Neverwinter Nights to increase the DCs of insta-death spells like Finger of Death and Wail of the Banshee. From what I could see, I like Abjuration a lot, Conjuration also seems nice, but it will depend on how you play your character. That decision has to be yours, brother. Ask people in Arelith about the schools to focus in, and you'll get your answer for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n Here in the ECB, we are good at building generic powerful toons, but it's customary for the buildee (in this case you) to apply\u00a0the server-specific tweaks TO the build. I may have read all these focuses, but there are many things there that I don't understand and have never seen before such as Enchantment Basin, for example. The typing commands are also Arelith-only,\u00a0and since\u00a0I won't be playing in Arelith, I truly CAN'T tell you which schools to focus in. If you were playing on WoG, I could tell you, because I know the server very well. For Arelith stuff, better ask Arelith players.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div>"
