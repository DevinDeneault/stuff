I decided what I wanted to do is not a cleric surprisingly enough, but I wanted to do a necromancer type character. However, going through it in single player I don't really know how to do that (since I remembered now palemaster requires special permissions don't know if I could get that or not). From what it looks like I needed to buff conjuration but I could be wrong.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

We are talking about massive bonusses/anti-buffs here along with other goodies like epic specialization from Fighter, you will be a best. We might even be able to get some of those Divine feats (might/shield) on top of those. This type of anti-hero is simply good till he starts to buff, then he becomes monstrous! It might be a bit more tricky to play him in his full potencial though, i don't know your abilities. And then, there is the other type that gets Bard only for a few strong points like (UMD, full Tumble, Taunt, fulll Spellcraft) and goes for more Blackguard/ Fighter Levels. That one anti-hero has much higher starting stats but lower end-potencial than the first, but he is also easier to play. Both builds are good. Select one and let me know.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I would say more of the range aspect, I mean melee is okay for close encounters, but I want him to really only be focused on range potential.

He has very good spot and elvensight for spotting hidden foes and even a low level but useful Bard song to aid him in battle.
