      "content": "<div>Hi, I just bought NwN EE and it's been a long time since I played this game. I'm looking to start playing the originial campaign in HC rules (maybe very difficult, but I don't know how hard it is) and without any henchman, since I prefer playing solo. I want to play a melee character, I like charging in a pack of enemies and doing a lot of damages and tanking. I dont like to play paladin or dwarf, so I'm probably gonna be playing a barbarian, fighter or sword master. But if you have a better suggestion, I'm open to it. For weapons I like to play with a two-handed weapon, but I don't mind playing with a shield if it what I need to stay alive. If I remember, playing with weapon&amp;shield is a lot better in NwN, but I might be wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you in advance.</div>"
