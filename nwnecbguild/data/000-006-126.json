He's going to be chugging clarities indefinitely until he gets UMD and can use lesser mind blank scrolls, or has a mind immunity item. Petrify using enemies and devastating critical warriors will need to be approached with care.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I thought this would be fun to play. A 'Proper' warrior with all the combat feats.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOther notes:<br/>\nI initially made this guy a Half-Orc to get to Panthro's 44 Str (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/panthro-the-strongest-dever-in-the-world-fighter-1-t2354901.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">panthro-the-strongest-dever-in-the-worl ... 54901.html</a>), but he had about 120 odd less skill points so obviously for overall power Human is way better<br/>\n<br/>\nDwarf would have also been good too, add 40hp and a whole bunch of dwarven goodies,\u00a0 minus 43 skill points and a pre-epic feat<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOther F/B/RDD builds with Fighter 26+:<br/>\n<br/>\nECB Archives<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\"

high an AB or Str score.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nDraconic Warrior is the closest with Str 40 and AB 49, and doesn't have devastating critical (it dual wields bastard swords which is interesting)<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrent ECB forum:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/brutus-fighter-28-bard-2-red-dragon-disciple-10-t2354627.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">brutus-fighter-28-bard-2-red-dragon-dis ... 54627.html</a><br/>\n- Half-orc, has Str 44 and AB 51, is a very nice build<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\"

93083.html</a><br/>\n- TyrTemplar's build has AB 48, Str 40, EWS/EWF and Dev crit in both scimitar and heavy flail, also a pretty nice build<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDemos's Dreadnought also deserves a mention (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/dreadnought-fighter-24-bard-6-red-dragon-disciple--t515496.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"

Mostly for comic relief. (Yes, it's hilarious, Lily as the toon is called barely reaches to the knee of the Ettins and Giants, but can still manage knockdowns due to the ginormous strength.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSince it's a gnome, I added Epic DR, since DR is king on Blackstone where I play. So far, doing good. A bit of a glass jaw, but if I get a few crits in before they hit me, I'm good. Can't really fight several enemies at once, though. Other than that, very fun build.

Hilarious gnomish lady knocking down Giants etc, sometimes its best to sacrifice some power just to watch that!<br/>\n<br/>\nI *suspect* a dex halfling build would potentially be the highest AB melee build, I also think knockdown's discipline check depends on size and AB, so a dex elf build might be the best knockdown build rather than strength. Anyway it might be time for a bit of investigation / experimentation when I get some time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've also been game testing this build. Its great right from the beginning, particularly the 18 Str for +4 AB +4 damage (+6 damage two handed).

And that's Luck of Heroes at level 1. So you could take the acid resistance there, for a drop of 1 to every saving throw (as you can only take LoH at level 1).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile I'm at it, I must confess, <em>@Orion</em>, that I'm a wee bit befuddled about the reasons behind taking exotic weapon proficiency, but that's probably just me, sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
