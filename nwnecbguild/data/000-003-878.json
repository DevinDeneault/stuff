      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">I look at a build concept with a class combo that seems to be new. I want it to become a strength based dual wielding stealth build with HIPS and Dev crit if possible.<br/>\nI look to combine the Ranger, Weaponmaster and Shadowdancer classes. There are no such builds here, and there are only 3 builds with that class combo in the old forums. Two of them are dex based. The third one, another good build by Cinnabar Dinn, is strength based, but has a too strong Ranger focus for my use.<br/>\nWeaponmaster is feat demanding and for that reason often combined with Fighter. You already want WF with every build, and Dodge/Mobility opens up SD. Expertise is fine sometimes, so the only less useful feats are Spring attack and WWA.<br/>\nRanger gives a good class skill selection with early access to SD and gets the Dual wield feats for free without having to take dex 15.<br/>\nI could have made a strength based dual wielding stealth build with Ranger and SD alone and gotten a character with wis 14 and full Ranger spellbook and a dual wield AB of 41 or 42.<br/>\nSo why pay the price for WM? I can get a dual wield AB of 47 or 48 (49 or 50 with a single weapon) I also get a better threat range and have a very high AB to confirm the threats. <br/>\nMy only concern is if I can live with the feat starvation, especially so if I try to reach for Dev crit.<br/>\nRanger Dual wield needs fighting in light armor. How well does that fit a strength build? And will I need to take Armor proficiency heavy?<br/>\nWith a dexterity of 14, the best AC you can get from medium armor is from Breast plate/Chain mail with 5 + 2 = 7. Once you can self buff with Cat's, a dexterity of 18 will give 4 + 4 = 8 in Chain shirt/Scale mail, or 3 + 4 = 7 in Studded/ Hide. Not quite as good as 8 + 1 = 9 from full plate. If you have access to dexterity boosting items, dex 22 gives AC 8 in leather and capped dex 26 gives AC 9 in padded armor.<br/>\nSo improving dex becomes important if you want to have a competing AC and dual wield in light armor. If you need better AC than that, you can single wield and grab a shield, activate expertise, or HIPS away.<br/>\nAny thoughts?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi Mick,<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I'm going to have to crap on the idea of a potential Dev Crit build - sorry. Assuming you go human for the extra feat, you're still only going to have 8 pre-epic feats, and WF, Dodge, Mobility, Expertise and the Spring and WW Attacks, make 6. That gives no room for all of PA, Cleave, GCleave and Imp Crit, unless, of course, you're happy taking a couple of them in epic levels. And even then you'd have no room for KD or Blind Fight, let alone heavy armour (the long-term merits of which I'm not sure about in any case).<br/>\n<br/>\nAn interesting stat spread that I recall is Valerfor's <strong>Dodji Domotai</strong> (apologies, links still don't seem to be working for me atm). I have played the build and enjoyed doing so. Admittedly, it's an elf Fighter16/ Rogue17/ WM7 and was apparently made with a particular purpose in mind, and has ED, but the stats are fairly unique: Str 16(26), Dex 18(25), Con 10, Wis 8, Int 14, Cha 8. Don't know if that helps or not <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\nAt least losing Dev Crit opens other avenues, maybe? I'll keep thinking...<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Very interesting. I think the balance point for AC is what you can max get in leather armor (or studded leather). It means you will have to spend some points on dexterity, so you will not really save the dex investment you need on a fighter build for dualwield. That in itself may make one question why ranger. It's not like the ranger spellbook is extremely good. Also, the companion is seldom useful on PW:s (even if some, like Blackstone Keep has buffed the familiars/companions).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy feeling is that this is a dead end, but I'm sincerely hoping you will prove me wrong. I will be following this with interest!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Although, you need 12 ranger levels to get the feats needed for WM, so you might as well go Ranger 13 (which will give you 3rd level spells which is enough since 4th level spells suck), WM 7 pre-epic to keep max pre-epic AB. Then add 10 SD and 10 WM post-epic. I'm thinking it's gonna be hard finding another split that makes sense (but please prove me wrong).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I mean he had no sneaks or CS, so what's the deal with hiding? Who would play such a thing?!<br/>\nAnd now I see the SD again!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, let's be serious for a moment here, why do you have to take Dev Crit in the first place with this build again Mick?<br/>\nYou could make it, yes, but at what cost?<br/>\nYou want to make this one of the old \"achievement builds\" of the past or something that actually works &amp; plays well?<br/>\nIf you want to have Dev Crit anyway, then the solution is to take as many Weapon-Master levels as possible &amp; ditch the extra SD levels, something like Ranger 15/ SD 3/ Weapon-Master 22 or similar.<br/>\nBut there is another way too, I am kinda fond of Cin's \"Baneblade\", but to perfect it I would actually take even more Ranger levels, I think Ranger 30/ SD 3/ Weapon-Master 7 would work like a charm.<br/>\nThink about it, full Ranger spells &amp; Animal Companion, HiPS, Bane of Enemies, 30-32 Strength, Dual-Kukris, Weapon-Master Crits, yummy...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this is getting long, so farewell for now ;)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Yes, I know, you could only take one of KD/BF/IC, but come on, roll with it for a moment. You're walking down a corridor whistling a merry tune when a seven foot lunatic appears from nowhere, knocks your head through a wall, smiles, nicks your purse, and is gone. I've even got the name...wait for it...\"The Invisible Hulk\". Got to be worth it!<br/>\n<br/>\nI like Valerfor's suggested R15/ SD3/ WM22 split, btw. Ample to get full BAB if you're prepared to hold SD until epic levels, or just dip by 1 if you want early HiPS. Presumably the last two SD levels are more for tumble dumps than anything. SD5 brings Def Roll, but you'd normally only want that on the way to ED, wouldn't you?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are still sacrifices, of course. No Imp Evasion, no UMD, no (your choice) KD/BF/IC, limited skills options, unpleasant saves.

Train journeys do seem to trigger interesting thoughts though - my messing about with GDL's Hearth Guard was the result of one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know what you mean about kamas, but I'm not sure how much better other dual-wield weapons would fare.

(I've just realized that while I'm supposed to be weaning myself off monk builds, I'm now trying to push them onto other people - oops!)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're looking for more AB, maybe Ranger 10/ Monk 11/ WM 19 might cut it?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

However, it comes at a price. If you take EWF as the WM13 bonus feat, EP at WM16 and AS at WM19, you could take Great Strength 1 at level 21. You'd also have to drop your starting Con by 2 and Int or Dex by 1 (or even Wis - I think you only need a starter of 11 for Ranger, but I might be wrong). So is 1AB worth 60 hps, either 1AC or 40 skill points or Ranger spells, and delaying EWF by 5 levels, EP by 10 and AS by 4? It wouldn't be for me, but I'm just saying that you could.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe lack of Blind Fight and Knockdown does still worry me, though. This fellow seems pretty much a one-trick pony, I'm afraid, and while the Dev Crit DC isn't at all bad, it's not stellar, and it comes fairly late in the build (and you play on hardcore as well, which ain't going help, is it?). I just wonder whether the same feat starvation that afflicted my thoughts about Bard/ WM/ RDD is similarly applicable here.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon't get me wrong, this is probably as optimized as it's going to get, I just wouldn't fancy trying it myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, the non-Dev Crit version might be a different story...<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to sound so downbeat <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT:</strong></em> Oh, and just to be selfish, shortswords are poo - go for hatchets!

What fires first in the round, a spot check or the first flurry of attacks, I don't know.<br/>\nIf you hide and are detected, you can reverse that by going out of stealth and enter stealth (HIPS) again immediately. If you can do that more often than the spot checks, it raises the question if you can avoid or at least escape detection by spamming HIPS even if your hide skill is very low.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
