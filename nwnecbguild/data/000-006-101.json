      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hail, ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\n I have just finalized what I consider to be a really cool concept build. Aerie is an Avariel Cleric / Mage multiclass from the Baldur's Gate Saga, who lost her wings and wound up in a Circus travelling with an old Illusionist named Quayle. She was really needy (like a real pain in the arse sometimes), easily offended, but also very pure and always eager to help. As Mick Dagger, Valerfor and I discussed back and forth several possible builds for her, I came up with this concept. In 3rd edition rules, I would need a lot of craftiness to translate what she was all about. She was always kind of frail (low CON) and cast a ton of spells when in your party, and she died quite quickly when enemies got in melee range (and I didn't click fast enough to get her out of trouble). Well, Clerics don't have ANY\u00a0no-save spells, so if I had gone for split stats (half and half between INT and WIS), half of her spells (the Cleric side) would have become useless. Wizards, on the other hand, have many options when it comes to no-save spells. Magic Missile, ILMS, IGMS are my favorite attack ones, but also the Bigby line and Time Stop, Spell Breaches, Mord's, Tenser's Transformation, Improved Invisibility, Damage Shields, Spell Mantle line,\u00a0etc..<br/>\n<br/>\n A sacrifice needed to be made in order to make both her sources of spell useful, and there's also Zen Archery, which makes WIS be the attacking stat and Monk AC bonus which also uses WIS. So, it was not as hard. She will use Cleric spells for killing with save spells, snipe with a bow to conserve her spells, scribe scrolls to have many tools and use the no-save wizard spells to be a very versatile caster. BUT, then there was the low CL issue, which was addressed with the taking of all Penetration feats. In combination with Mord's (preferrably from scrolls), is enough to pierce Toolset SR cap of 32. So, she can handle herself pretty well. Some Drow and high-level Monk enemies will be challenging but doable. She can snipe them and hide behind a Summoned Creature, use Invisibility potions or Scrolls or just stop time and either flee or kill.<br/>\n<br/>\n She is VERY DISPELLABLE, so that is something that you need to know and prepare for in advance. You can deal with dispel-spammers in many different ways: stopping time and attacking, Bigby 6ing them to the ground, or simply blowing out IGMSs at their faces, stopping time so they can't heal. Or buffing from scrolls and conserving her buffs for after she's been dispelled. I think this is a very faithful build to the character and I hope most who have played BG saga will agree. Thanks to Mick and Valerfor for the (slightly heated) discussions that led to the completion of this build.<br/>\n<br/>\n Aerie, the wingless Avariel:<br/>\n<br/>\n Cleric(19), Illusionist(19),

Valerfor suggested a tweak that is worth mentioning. If you want your\u00a0Evocation spells DC\u00a0to be slightly\u00a0higher and to be able to acommodate Craft Wand in pre-epics, delay GSF: Evocation to epics, drop 2 Great Wisdom and take GSF and ESF in Evocation. The balance is:<br/>\n<br/>\n - You gain: Craft Wand and +1 DC for Evocation spells<br/>\n - You lose: 1 AB, 1 AC, 1 DC for all spells from other schools (which there aren't many useful ones, I only ever use\u00a0Destruction\u00a0and Storm of Vengeance, but especially SoV I use a lot).<br/>\n<br/>\n I would rather not mess with the usefulness of SoV for my playing style, but if you think the above trade is worthwhile, it's doable.<br/>\n<br/>\n There are some builds in the Search Engine that could be compared to this one, except they all have a very different layout. 4 builds have 23 Wiz / 17 Cleric, two have Monk as well (the two that inspired my Magical Master) and there are two other builds here. My Magical Master and my Speedy Sniper, but neither is even close to the same concept. A very well-rounded high-AC, good-AB, Zen-Arching Divine and Arcane dual-caster whose primary focus is SPELLS (not buffs and combat), but who can hold her own if the need arises as long as enemies are far away. I like this build a lot not because it's UBER-powerful, but because it's very well thought out and demanded extreme building finesse on my part. Like a father whose son got an A, I am proud of the way my Aerie turned out.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Harm is a spell that is cast up-close with a melee touch attack, which is ill-advised for her to say the least, since she's supposed to stay away from physical confrontations to shine, but I guess I should've said that Clerics have no\u00a0reliable no-save spells. I know you get my point, but anyway. Harm is a 6th level spell, WoF is a 7th level spell, what about 8th and 9th level spells? I do use them, especially WoF, but not for killing, more for crowd control and summon dispelling. Since she kills things with spells, I reckon she needs to rely on DCs for Cleric spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for dispellability we are talking exclusively about Greater Dispelling, because Mord's cast by any even mediocre caster will strip you of all your buffs most likely. So yeah, she's very dispellable. But she's also very resourceful, so it's OK.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks :D<br/>\n \u00a0</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Wands give you comfort, but aren't necessary. If you drop the Evocation focus, what will happen is you'll lose 6 points on your Implosion DC to do something that you have other ways of doing already (scrolls). The thing about her is that, despite being the same 3 classes as the MM, she's actually VERY different to play. For starters, she's an archer, which makes her easier to play early on, and harder to play in high epics. Secondly, I made her worship Ehlonna, which means she has improved Summons. And finally, she has access to tools that the MM doesn't have, like high-DC 9th level spells on the Cleric side, which would be a shame to lose, and IMO would limit her effectiveness. Why don't you have the MM craft her the wands you want, but them from him, and keep her as is? I'll PM you about something.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
