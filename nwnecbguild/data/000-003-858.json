It also looks like you're taking Power Attack twice, so that's another one - hooray! Now that's good for another reason as well, as you'll only need 5 levels of Fighter pre-epic (with WM7 in there to replace it), so you can use the level 6 bonus feat for EWS, thereby freeing up a general feat. I'd look at only taking those 6 levels of Fighter and taking 8 levels of WM, as Nordock gives the WM +2 strength for every 8 levels taken. And it will also give you the space to include Devastating Critical.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I say, that's just on a quick look, but might it be a reasonable direction?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">A couple more quickies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat remaining spare feat pre-epic could be used for Knockdown.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can't see anything to suggest you need a starting Dex of 15, so I'd drop that to 12 (particularly with the smith getting a -5 to Dex), assuming you'll be wearing full plate of course. And I'm not sure why you want your Wis at 11 either, but you probably have a good reason. That should give you some more points to play with at creation (with or without any changes to Wis).<br/>\n<br/>\nEqually, and given that you'll be getting +4 to Con from DwD (+2 at 10 and another +2 at 20), even with a final Con of 22 (for EDR III) you'll have a ridiculously high hp pool, so you wouldn't need to use so many stat bumps for it - 2 should be enough. So even more for Strength becomes available.<br/>\n<br/>\nI notice, though, that you don't currently take EDR II, just I and III, so you'll need to change that. And you might also think about taking Armor Skin as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdmittedly, that looks bad for taking all the Great Strengths you want, but with the changes I'm suggesting you'll end up with a higher Str anyway (2 from stat bumps, 2 from WM 8, and at least 1 from dropping Dex down, and maybe another if you do the same with Wis).<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease tell me if I'm barking up the wrong tree here!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

So I wondered about taking Int 14, making it a more respectable 172. If I've got my sums right, your starting (finishing) stats could then read:<br/>\n<br/>\nStr 16 (30) [comprising 16 + 9 stat bumps + 2 WM level 8 + 3 Great Strengths]<br/>\nDex 10 [losing 1 AC]<br/>\nCon 16 (21) [comprising 16 + 1 stat bump + 4 DwD level 20. That's enough for EDR III and still gives 692 hps]<br/>\nWis 12 [to be tidy and boost will save by 1. And with a +3 to Wis at creation, 11 is your minimum real starting point]<br/>\nInt 14 [for the extra 43 skill points]<br/>\nCha 6<br/>\n<br/>\nThat would enable you to take all your current pre-epic feats (though I'd still swap Imp Power Attack for Knockdown), and 3 Great Strengths, EWF, Ow Crit, Dev Crit and Epic Prowess as general epic feats, with EWS as your epic Fighter bonus feat, and EDR I, II and III as well as Armor Skin (and the extra AC is very useful, particularly if dropping Dex down to 10) as DwD bonus feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the skills go, you can max Discipline (43 pts), cross class 20 in Tumble (costing 40 pts), and take your 4 in Intimidate (costing 8). That still leaves you with 81 points to play with, which is almost 2 more maxed skills - such as Spellcraft (cross classed again), Listen, and Concentration.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow does that sound?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Sorry, you Ninja'd me! That all sounds a bit weird, particularly with an AB of 45 (30 BAB + 10 Str + 3 WF/EWF + 1 EP + 1 WM). I'll have to have a think.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
