      "content": "<div>Hello all!<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first Aielund completion has been done with a female paladin smiter, Cylla....I enjoyed the playthrough a lot, but wanted to try other classes and pcs....and then became WoG.<br/>\n<br/>\nBard fighters, sorcerer/Pal/CoTs, Bard sorcerers.....only arcane magic here, in WoG (offline). Then, the first PC in the server is a divine caster/meeler: next character for my playthroughs will be a PM STR fighter and, after that, a paladin smiter.<br/>\nI have never found class splits as the below one; I understand that there is a \"why\", as it lacks the mega saves provided by Champion of Torm, and she has less strenght than <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2294236/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dragon lance<span style=\"color:#000000\"> by TyrTemplar (no RDD class).</span></a><br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, I tried to balance smite power (up to great smite +5) with an average melee prowess. I post the draft, for your review.<br/>\nI point out that, even if I though about playing the build in WoG, this is a general build.

      "content": "<div>Overall it looks like a decent melee build with a nice trump card for any tough bosses. The Divine Might damage alone should be enough to finish off any enemies that your physical damage can't deal with.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy default smiter is a rapier-wielding Pal29/CoT10/Monk1 with Great Smiting X since there is a larger chance of a smite critical compared to other weapons. Although bastard sword does have higher base damage, I think that the increased threat range makes switching to rapier or scimitar worthwhile.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think you should try to fit in Epic Prowess, either by dropping Armor Skin, dropping Great STR, or moving your pre-epic Fighter level to epic levels. I also think that Divine Shield is worth considering if you're planning on having a high AC, with fully buffed CHA you can potentially reach the dodge cap depending on the items available on your server.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless your server has altered Smite Evil then the extra damage is physical rather than divine, so it will be affected by DI/DR just as your regular physical attacks are.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is no way to prevent vanilla Mords from dispelling your buffs, however since it is based on the dispeller's caster level your buffs can't be dispelled by a mage with 26 caster levels or less. The dispel check is Dispeller CL + 1d20 vs Buffer CL + 12, with a draw resulting in a dispel. In this case we have 26 + 20 = 46 vs 35 + 12 = 47, so a 26 CL dispeller can't win. This only affects the dispel effect of Mords though, the breach effect ignores caster level completely.</div>"
