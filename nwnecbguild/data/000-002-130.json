      "content": "<div>It depends a lot on what your build goals are and most definitely where you play and how things are balanced.  It is different for every world / module.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have, for example, played on persistent worlds where cleave/great cleave is important because the enemies have low HP but come in hoards.  I have also played on worlds where enemies have high HP so cleave is less effective.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, all things remaining equal, in general:<br/>\n1. The ability to hit something is the most critical.  So Weapon Focus is first on the list.<br/>\n2. The ability to damage something is the second most critical. Weapon specialisation offers damage with no downside/cost, so second on the list.  Power attack / cleave offer additional damage each with caveats and cleave requires power attack.<br/>\n3. You cannot hit or damage if you are not alive.  So things that keep you alive are either #1 on the list or #3 on the list depending on what is needed to keep you alive whilst you hit and deliver damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>"

      "content": "<div>Massive question, darktooth. As Zanithar says, so much will depend on the type of build (there are many, many \"pure\" fighter types) and environment (solo/coop, modules/pws - and different types of both, Dev Crit-enabled or not, types of enemy you'll encounter, whether you need playability throughout or are just seeking L40 power, and so on).<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, always hold at the front of your mind that the \"Recommended\" button awakens an idiot who proceeds to handicap any build at all times. Ignore it always, please.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou list 9 feats available pre-epic. Of those, I believe only Blind Fight is absolutely necessary. When you take it will depend on where you play, and when folk will start casting darkness and/or sneaking on you. A meleer has one job, and one alone, and that's to fight. If you're just standing there like a dummy you'll get hit and it will hurt, and you can't respond. Take it early (levels 1-6, unless there are more pressing demands on your schedule).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou left Knockdown out (and possibly its bigger brother) of your list. This is also a necessity (as is IKD if you're a Hin or Gnome - stats permitting). Mages in particular are bastards. Stop 'em casting by flattening them then chopping them to bits. KD will gimp your AB, so there's no point taking it until you've a reasonable chance of it working - probably between levels 6 and 9.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only other necessity is if you're going for a DEX build, in which case you'll want Weapon Finesse (probably at level 1-3).<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously you can only take WS on or after Fighter 4 (always on a Fighter level). My advice would be to take it as early as possible. Your defences will be weak at lower levels, and your AB will be relatively low, so when you do hit enemies you want it to hurt as much as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapon Focus is traditional (some with more than one, others with none) because it bumps AB by 1, which is always good. But it's with a particular weapon type, so it helps to know your environment again (are there any decent morningstars/Dwarven waraxes/scythes/etc available?), or you might end up being great with a weapon that there are none of where you play. If taking the feat, and knowing where you play, take it when it's of most value. That's likely to be early, but if you know Dwarven waraxes aren't available for the first 18 levels, you might want to wait before focusing in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nCleave is a nice feat to have. If you're playing a STR build, taking Power Attack is a pita though (unless you've got some Monk, of course). PA in itself is only really useful for DEX builds, or if you're going for Dev Crit or wanting some Blackguard. Great Cleave is only useful if going for Dev Crit. Others may argue, but they're wrong. You can easily get caught in a GC loop: you're in a chokepoint with enemies in the portal and there's an ill-tempered mage behind them. You want to cut through so you can reach the mage before everyone (mostly you) is dead, but GC virtually guarantees you'll be chopping into the mob for the duration. Not good. If you have to take it, make it between levels 18 and 20 - depending on Toughness.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of which, Toughness is a luxury. And it needs to be taken as a General Feat. If you're playing a tank, fair enough, roll another 40 hps up. But if you're going for a straight front-liner or flanker you'd be better served with other feats, otherwise it's a bit like saying \"I have no confidence in this build\". Of course, there are exceptions when it's a prerequisite for another class, but if you're taking it just because you can, take it at level 18.<br/>\n<br/>\nDodge is handy, particularly at early levels, for +1AC against a single enemy you're facing, but soon loses its value. It is, however, a prerequisite for several other classes and feats. Another one that doesn't hurt, but also a bit of a luxury.<br/>\n<br/>\nImproved Critical is definitely a should-have. Your job is to carve things to bits, and if you can do at least double damage by landing a crit on them, then critting them as often as possible has to be a good thing. Probably best taken between levels 9 and 15.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat'll probably do for now. The Disarm twins, dual-weapons, and epic feats can wait for another time. As can more defensive feats such as save boosts and how skills play into a build.<br/>\n<br/>\nI write as one who plays melee characters (without any arcane/divine mucking about) a good 90% of the time, so I hope this helps a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",
