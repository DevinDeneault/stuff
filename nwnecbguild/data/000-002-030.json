And no, they do not have Ultravision, vanilla TS, etc).\u00a0 The inclusion now of mighty (and many) spellcasters complicates the matter, due to the Eldar Riftlords bombing you with dispels, extremely high level Fingers of Death, Ice Storms, and total ignorance of stealth and any attempt to delay them.\u00a0 The Cyclops Warpriests are nasty, and rez constantly from the security of GS (that works, for them, but not for us Players).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs such, it is basically almost suicide for Gloomrazer to poke it's nose in there - not up to and including the Gates, but beyond that (where one runs into a literal HORDE of nasty opponents, just slavering to mash you into a pulp).<br/>\n<br/>\nHiPS, on the other hand, does not suffer from this, it shuts aggro down, IMMEDIATELY!\u00a0 That makes it possible to use the main weapons of the Gloomer - Crippling Strike, to reduce Str (and therefore combat effectiveness) AND gets the swarm to stop attacking all at once (not to mention breaking the spell targeting of spellcasters). It is this factor (and this alone) that has convinced me to go with a HiPS based Gloomy.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I am sure that oodles of Epic Trap fields would win the day - but that is not really a Gloomrazer highpoint (it is more a point of any build that can lay down such traps).<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that without the valuable feedback from sandii, I would have never experienced this, because I have already levelled Gloomrazer to 40 and saw no need to muck around in old stomping grounds.\u00a0 So a big thank you to sandii, for giving me this feedback, so that I could go there, test, and get totally wrecked...hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd by that, I mean like 10 times in a row (4 to Finger of Death, I know, I know, I roll 1s all the time, but still...meh) and the other 6 times just squashed like a bug.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
