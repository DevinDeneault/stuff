That gives you a \"free spell book\" with those spells stored in the sequencer every day. You only need to be able to cast from scrolls, so it is even possible with a Monk10/Wiz 1/AA29 or Monk9 Wiz1/AA30 build.<br/>\n\u00a0As for the build, I would drop Toughness and maybe even Called shot. After all you are supposed to be able to outrun the foes to begin with. That let you clear two epic feat slots.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
