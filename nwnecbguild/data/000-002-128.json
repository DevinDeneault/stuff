      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">It's a matter of feats and priority mostly, improved knockdown has priority over improved disarm for disabling mages and thieves and has to be taken first. After that you may not have the available feats for that, not everybody is a fighter/ xx/ champion of torm build anyway. But after all is said and done it is also a matter of playing style. Most people tend to play defensively, so when they have to go without the shield's armour class (wog and sinfar aside) they want to see a really good benefit for that and not just a situational AB boost.<br/>\n<br/>\n Those things, don't change the fact that iimproved disarm is an awesome feat though. Take it whenever you can.<br/>\n<br/>\n See here also, i am talking about it =&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2354319/BARBARIANROGUE?page=1#.VDfoMRZIrhQ\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/23 ...

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Greetings\u00a0Theophilus Fist!<br/>\n<br/>\nImproved disarm is a fabulous feat for any strength two handed build (or two bladed sword/double axe/dire mace), if you can spare the feats, exactly as Valerfor writes.<br/>\nI agree it is very underrated and should be used more. In fact I believe any serious two handed strength fighter build should try to get improved disarm.<br/>\nIt makes you feel like any non-spellcaster who doesnt bring a proper (large) weapon to a fight with you is not worthy of truly battling you.<br/>\nSmack that weapon out of their hand! Show me a proper weapon :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is basically a free disarm attempt for anyone who is not using a large weapon, fists, or a creature weapon. Plus one gets bonus +4 and +8 AB if they are using a small or tiny weapon. That bonus AB is also added to threat rolls, so you also have an additional chance to critical hit. One gets attacks of opportunity if NPC enemies are disarmed and not wearing gloves. Ordinary fists also struggle to penetrate damage reduction unless they are a monk or are wearing monk gloves. That ghostly visage becomes very high value all of a sudden. The feat also makes one change their cognitive strategy against rogue enemies. Without improved disarm one might try to knock them down or at least attack them so they don't sneak you to death. With Improved disarm one is spamming that feat as soon as a rogue with a knife turns up. Sometimes I am hoping the disarm attempt fails so I can continue to have that sweet sweet +4-8 AB :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Valerfor that Blind Fight, Knockdown and Improved Knockdown are higher on the priority list than Improved Disarm.<br/>\nTherefore feats become a problem and I've struggled to find a way to put improved disarm into builds without bonus combat feats, ie without Fighter or CoT, it is just far too much of a compromise and there arent enough feats.<br/>\nBut in any two handed strength fighter build, I try to get it with all the bonus feats available.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI think <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build303254.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Charnel Lord</a> is a nice example of very good usage of the Improved Disarm feat. Palemaster builds have amazing defensive abilities but are hard to get the AB up compared with others, the improved disarm plus large weapon helps balance the build out quite nicely, plus the extra AB helps with devastating critical attempts :)<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding exceeding the +20 AB Cap, there was a competition in the ECB many years back to try to get the highest melee AB possible in a single attack. Improved Disarm featured, along with cheesy Druid levels for extra AB outdoors, Weapon Master 28, Paladin for Taunt and Smite Evil for extra bonus AB was also used.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's a few posts from the ages:<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build240191.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Strength Highest Possible Melee AB</a> by Mithdradates<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build239999.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dexterity Highest Possible Melee AB</a> by Grimnir77<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps with some insight into this feat, it is definitely one of my favorites<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Actually I have noted some creatures (for example, the Duergar Rogues in the Duergar Mines of Abbor-Alz in WoG who seem to be wielding a shortsword) cannot be disarmed, however in the same module, similar creatures can be disarmed (ie Duergar Wall who dual wield warhammers or light hammers in the same area - hard to say which is which visually).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt raises two questions for me:<br/>\n1. Do I get the AB bonus from the improved disarm attempt despite the creature not being disarmable<br/>\n2. What is in the toolset which makes one creature (who should be disarmable) undisarmable, while another disarmable? My guess is that one creature has a weapon listed as a 'creature' weapon, while the other has it equipped.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n1. is going to be just being more observant I think, 2. should be simple enough when I get time to open the toolset<br/>\n<br/>\nI also am curious as to which SP modules D/ID shouldn't be taken, so I take a build with those feats taken out :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">The AB effects of Disarm will remain even if the target can't be disarmed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only way to make a creature immune to Disarm is to curse their weapon. This prevents the Disarm from working at all but the AB effect will remain.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just did some testing with a few different cases.<br/>\nBy default creatures are not disarmable, which means that they can lose their weapon to Disarm but they won't drop it. To make a disarmed weapon drop the creature must be disarmable and the weapon must be droppable, which requires changing the default settings. So making Disarm work on NPCs the same way it works for PCs is a conscious choice on the part of the module's creator.<br/>\nIf the creator chooses to make the creature immune to Disarm then they have to curse the weapon in the creature's right hand, so that is also a conscious choice.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
