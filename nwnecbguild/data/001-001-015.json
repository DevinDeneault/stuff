      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">I could use some help modding my game. \u00a0I\u2019m having difficulty finding any modules and custom content that work.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be clear and reiterate, my only option is to play NWN:EE, and only on my iOS device.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019ve spent many hours searching for how to do this. \u00a0The single source I found explaining how is one Reddit post from months ago. \u00a0Here is a quote of the relevant info explaining how to mod the iOS version of the game:<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2018Step 1: Head over to Neverwinter Vault and look for a module you want.<br/>\nStep 2: Download the module, make sure to grab any extra files the module might require<br/>\nStep 3: When the module finishes downloading save it into your files<br/>\nStep 4: Extract the files from the zip into a separate folder (ONLY FILES IN THE SEPARATE FOLDER, NO SUB DIRECTORIES aka NO OTHER FOLDERS IN THE FOLDER)<br/>\nStep 5: rename the folder to include an @ symbol at the beginning of it, ie: @eyeofthebeholder<br/>\nStep 6: move this folder into your NVN/EE folder in your files<br/>\nStep 7: Load up the game and click on the store, and hit customize, on the left side of the screen you should see your module, install it. It will appear under \u201cother modules\u201d when you start new game.\u2019 [sic]<br/>\n<br/>\nMy first question is: \u00a0what are the good websites to find modules? \u00a0The only one I know of is neverwintervault.org, and every page loads painfully slow for me (my internet connection speed seems plenty fast in every other way I\u2019ve used it so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the issue).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy next question is: \u00a0will someone please spell out in great detail exactly how to install mods on iOS?<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing the instructions above I attempted to install numerous modules and types of custom content and so far I found exactly one that works: \u00a0Customize Character Override HAK (CCOH). \u00a0I love this one because I hate the way most default armors look.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a short list of mods I tried that don\u2019t work using the above technique:<br/>\n* The Lord of Terror module<br/>\n* CEP 2.6 (it installs with no error messages, but it doesn\u2019t do anything?)<br/>\n* several portrait packs (again, no errors but no new portraits are available to choose in game)<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if I have to limit myself to EE only mods, or if there are some other basic filters I need to consider that I am currently unaware of. \u00a0Is there a defined list of mods that are known to work with NWN:EE iOS?<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of my desperation stems from the fact I only have about 20 free hours per week to play around with this. \u00a0I might even figure it out myself in a few months time....<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease help me out? \u00a0I am in love with this game and will really bummed out if I\u2019m limited to the OC, expansions, and official modules only.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Alright, OrangeAGENT, I can't promise anything, but I might be able to help a bit (I am to technology what Minsc is to diplomacy).<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, are we clear about the difference between \"modules\" and \"modifications\"? Both tend to be unhelpfully shortened to \"mods\". Using your 3 examples of \"failed mods\", Lord of Terror is a module, and requires a CEP modification to work. Unfortunately, it needs an earlier one than you've loaded (check the Lord of Terror thread in this forum for details on which one you do need). The CEP modification you have loaded won't \"do\" anything - what it will do is allow you to play the newer modules you might want to load up. Afraid I'm not going to be much use as far as the portrait packs go, but I suspect they, too, are modifications rather than modules, so you'll only be able to use them when playing an appropriate module.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn essence, a module is what you play: a modification alters the experience of playing. We've tried to be helpful here in the Guild by putting modifications under the heading \"Add-Ons\".<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, over to people who know what they're on about...<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The cep1.x is the only cep on the vault that\u2019s an .exe, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s even possible to run a .exe on iOS.  It\u2019s also likely that cep1.x will be necessary to run some of these modules.  Sigh.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
