      "content": "<div>First off thank y'all for the info on the first build I was playing with. Learning about the strengths and weaknesses of various ways to build is great. I've a different idea here, though not completely new, viewing the archives.<br/>\n<br/>\n I like Paladin, both for its strengths and for RP reasons, so I decided to go and find some builds that involved it as the main class. Lots of smite builds, dev crit cot/fighter/paladin, etc. I saw rogue in a build and went \"...that's interesting\" then realized \"hey, tumble!\" which lead me to \"harper scout has tumble...lets use that?\" Of course I'm far from the first person to think of that, so there's a few builds lying around that were Pal/CoT/Harper. There's one on these forums that's a dexer. That's neat! And several smiters in the build archives. I didn't find a non-smiter though. (I really don't like dedicating tons of epic levels to smiting, it feels too \"one-trick-pony\"ish). So, lets give this a shot.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\nPaladin(25), Champion of Torm(10), Harper Scout(5), Human<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 16 (18)<br/>\n DEX: 8<br/>\n CON: 12<br/>\n WIS: 14<br/>\n INT: 12<br/>\n CHA: 14 (31)<br/>\n<br/>\n Human: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n 01: Paladin(1): Iron Will, Alertness, {Divine Grace, Divine Health, Lay on Hands}<br/>\n 02: Paladin(2): {Aura of Courage, Smite Evil}<br/>\n 03: Paladin(3): Weapon Focus: Longsword, {Remove Disease, Turn Undead}<br/>\n 04: Paladin(4): CHA+1, (CHA=15)<br/>\n 05: Paladin(5)<br/>\n 06: Paladin(6): Extend Spell<br/>\n 07: Paladin(7)<br/>\n 08: Paladin(8): CHA+1, (CHA=16)<br/>\n 09: Paladin(9): Extra Turning<br/>\n 10: Paladin(10)<br/>\n 11: Champion of Torm(1)<br/>\n 12: Champion of Torm(2): CHA+1, Toughness, Power Attack, {Sacred Defense}, (CHA=17)<br/>\n 13: Champion of Torm(3)<br/>\n 14: Champion of Torm(4): Blind Fight<br/>\n 15: Paladin(11): Divine Might<br/>\n 16: Champion of Torm(5): CHA+1, {Divine Wrath}, (CHA=18)<br/>\n 17: Champion of Torm(6): Knockdown<br/>\n 18: Paladin(12): Divine Shield<br/>\n 19: Paladin(13)<br/>\n 20: Paladin(14): CHA+1, (CHA=19)<br/>\n 21: Harper Scout(1): Great Strength I, Great Charisma I, {Bardic Knowledge}, (STR=17), (CHA=20)<br/>\n 22: Harper Scout(2): {Deneir's Eye, Sleep}<br/>\n 23: Paladin(15)<br/>\n 24: Paladin(16): CHA+1, Great Strength II, (STR=18), (CHA=21)<br/>\n 25: Champion of Torm(7)<br/>\n 26: Champion of Torm(8): Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword<br/>\n 27: Harper Scout(3): Great Charisma II, {Cat's Grace, Tymora's Smile}, (CHA=22)<br/>\n 28: Champion of Torm(9): CHA+1, (CHA=23)<br/>\n 29: Champion of Torm(10): Armor Skin<br/>\n 30: Paladin(17): Great Charisma III, (CHA=24)<br/>\n 31: Paladin(18)<br/>\n 32: Harper Scout(4): CHA+1, {Eagle's Splendor, Lliira's Heart}, (CHA=25)<br/>\n 33: Paladin(19): Great Charisma IV, (CHA=26)<br/>\n 34: Paladin(20)<br/>\n 35: Paladin(21)<br/>\n 36: Paladin(22): CHA+1, Great Charisma V, (CHA=28)<br/>\n 37: Harper Scout(5): Great Charisma VI, {Craft Harper Item, Invisibility (Harper)}, (CHA=29)<br/>\n 38: Paladin(23): Epic Prowess<br/>\n 39: Paladin(24): Great Charisma VII, (CHA=30)<br/>\n 40: Paladin(25): CHA+1, (CHA=31)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 460<br/>\n Skillpoints: 182<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 40/35/33<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses: Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +2<br/>\n BAB: 30<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 38 (melee), 30 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 19/30<br/>\n Spell Casting: Paladin(4)<br/>\n Alignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\n Discipline 43(47), Lore 6(12), Persuade 8(18), Search 4(5), Taunt 43(53), Tumble 40(39), remaining skillpoints 34<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Discipline(4), Lore(4), Persuade(4), Taunt(4),\u00a0<br/>\n 02: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Persuade(1), Taunt(1),\u00a0<br/>\n 03: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Persuade(1), Taunt(1),\u00a0<br/>\n 04: Discipline(1), Persuade(1), Taunt(1), Save(1),\u00a0<br/>\n 05: Discipline(1), Persuade(1), Taunt(1), Save(2),\u00a0<br/>\n 06: Discipline(1), Search(2), Taunt(1),\u00a0<br/>\n 07: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(2),\u00a0<br/>\n 08: Discipline(1), Search(2), Taunt(1),\u00a0<br/>\n 09: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(2),\u00a0<br/>\n 10: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(4),\u00a0<br/>\n 11: Discipline(1), Save(7),\u00a0<br/>\n 12: Discipline(1), Save(10),\u00a0<br/>\n 13: Discipline(1), Save(13),\u00a0<br/>\n 14: Discipline(1), Save(16),\u00a0<br/>\n 15: Discipline(1), Taunt(5), Save(14),\u00a0<br/>\n 16: Discipline(1), Save(17),\u00a0<br/>\n 17: Discipline(1), Save(20),\u00a0<br/>\n 18: Discipline(1), Taunt(3), Save(20),\u00a0<br/>\n 19: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(22),\u00a0<br/>\n 20: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(24),\u00a0<br/>\n 21: Discipline(1), Tumble(20), Save(9),\u00a0<br/>\n 22: Discipline(1), Tumble(5), Save(9),\u00a0<br/>\n 23: Discipline(1), Taunt(3), Save(9),\u00a0<br/>\n 24: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(11),\u00a0<br/>\n 25: Discipline(1), Save(14),\u00a0<br/>\n 26: Discipline(1), Save(17),\u00a0<br/>\n 27: Discipline(1), Tumble(5), Save(17),\u00a0<br/>\n 28: Discipline(1), Save(20),\u00a0<br/>\n 29: Discipline(1), Save(23),\u00a0<br/>\n 30: Discipline(1), Taunt(6), Save(20),\u00a0<br/>\n 31: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(22),\u00a0<br/>\n 32: Discipline(1), Tumble(5), Save(22),\u00a0<br/>\n 33: Discipline(1), Taunt(2), Save(23),\u00a0<br/>\n 34: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(25),\u00a0<br/>\n 35: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(27),\u00a0<br/>\n 36: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(29),\u00a0<br/>\n 37: Discipline(1), Tumble(5), Save(29),\u00a0<br/>\n 38: Discipline(1), Taunt(2), Save(30),\u00a0<br/>\n 39: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(32),\u00a0<br/>\n 40: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(34),\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n The low level feats for this build are wonky. I worked in a lot of things that are valuable, as well as the HS prereqs, but due to the way feats can be taken, it's a weird progression. You could take the first two CoT levels earlier, get Divine Might 3 levels earlier, at the cost of level 2 Paladin spell slots delayed.<br/>\n<br/>\n Alternatively, drop Toughness. That shoves Iron Will up to level 18, Power Attack is taken at 1, and you have a much more sensible feat progression. You can move two CoT levels to Epic then. This is a better idea for a playable character at the low levels. You might start with 15Str and 14 Con to compensate. (The more I think, the more I like this option).<br/>\n<br/>\n Str/Cha balance. So with the HS feats, you take Great Charisma. However with all your other Epic feats, you can take whatever. Get more Str for more AB standard, or lean more Cha for DM/DS. All I know is I like starting with 15-16 str because armor is heavy.<br/>\n<br/>\n Leftover skill points - throw them into Listen or whatever makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n Of course maxxed tumble, the entire point of taking harper (also works better from an RP perspective than Rogue, imo.)<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyways, poke holes in this, or show me a build I missed. I appreciate the feedback!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hey man! I didn't have time to look into this much, but right off the bat, there are 2 holes I can poke.<br/>\n<br/>\n You take Alertness and Iron Will at level 1, but only take HS at 21, so why not take them at 15 and 18 respectively and anticipate some of your combat feats?<br/>\n<br/>\n Another thing is, if you're not going for Smiting, why so much CHA investment? STR gives you AB and damage, whereas CHA gives you saves and damage while in Divine Might, and AC while in Divine Shield, negated if you're flat-footed. That also begs the question: why did you end on an odd number? Generally, that's a bad idea, and I don't see anything in this build that tells me that this'd be an exception.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, Rogue gives Tumble and UMD, not just Tumble. HS gives only Tumble (nothing wrong with that, but I thought I'd point it out anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\n I gotta go to work now, but if I have some time later on, I'll take a deeper look into it.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, you should read my Paladin guide in the Game Guides section. It'll help you have a better understanding of what to aim for. And maybe even have a better grasp of the advice you'll receive.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div>"

The differences - Emp takes Fighter, and my build has COT. (I did set final str/cha to the same for comparison, but I was intending to increase str anyways). So what does that mean:<br/>\n Fighter - 1 extra feat and the ability to take Weapon Specialization. (also can take the feats earlier since you don't have the BAB +7 req)<br/>\n COT - Higher Saves, LoH synergy, Divine Wrath.<br/>\n The Fighter build took Cleave with that extra feat, dropped Toughness, and added Weapon Specialization. A feat in Epic levels was used for Epic Weapon Specialization.<br/>\n My build: I switched it up to Scimitar, took Improved Critical instead of Toughness (After realizing that the damage from Divine Might can Crit) and modified the starting stats from how I had it originally. Note that this starts with 15str and 14 con (40 extra hp at 40). Because I'm not taking EWS, I can take that extra Great Str to get the end stats to even out.<br/>\n<br/>\n When it comes down to it, Fighter may be a better choice! you get 6 more physical damage (and a feat to play with - cleave or Imp Crit) at the cost of 40hp and 6/5/8 worth of saves. Offense vs defense, as it were.<br/>\n<br/>\n One thing I'm still not certain of is what's place where you can say \"this is a good save value.\" Obviously Cha paladins are high, + CoT is quite high.<br/>\n My current questions in my head:<br/>\n 1. 6 physical dmg vs +40hp +6fort 5/will 8/reflex<br/>\n 2. Improved Crit or Cleave - both are excellent skills.<br/>\n 3. Str vs Chr - though I think a balance is best here. (24/24 or 26/22)<br/>\n<br/>\n With HS, you get Cat's Grace, to make up for your Dex. You also get a stackable Eagle's Splendor. That could negate the need for +cha gear (correct me if I'm wrong - +12 is the cap and Aura of Glory + Eagle's (+ Eagle's?) + gear would go right over that cap.)<br/>\n<br/>\n And to answer the question of why not rogue. Good question. I would get UMD, as well as a plethora of skill points, and Evasion. Harper gives Cats Grace, a few other minor abilities, and handily, the ability to use Great Charisma on its bonus feats in epic levels. There's something neat about everything in its place.<br/>\n<br/>\n As always thank for the feed back!<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

There's nothing wrong with the concept. I was merely pointing out that HS and Rogue weren't that similar. The fact you don't need to invest those feats and skills is nice, of course, but UMD makes such a HUGE difference for a melee toon! For example: without UMD, your toon won't be able to wear monk boots, buff with FW or DF scrolls / wands, Stoneskin, Premonition, Greater Spell Mantle scrolls, use scrolls of summons to help out or simply die while you kill! The impact of losing UMD is just too great in-game, much more than it looks on paper.<br/>\n<br/>\n That being said, building with HS IS FUN and I totally encourage it!<br/>\n<br/>\n As for the second version of your build, here are my comments:<br/>\n<br/>\n I like the stats, except for CON x INT. I'd drop CON down to 12 and get INT up to 14. That will allow you to take Expertise (to combo with Taunt) and IKD, which are really good to have, plus another full skill, although there isn't much to choose from. Maybe you can take Listen to spot stealthers, and then dump the rest in other useful skills. One point in Open Locks, cross-classing Disable Traps or Spellcraft for saves vs spells, Concentration to resist Taunts. Options aren't great, but they do exist!<br/>\n<br/>\n I'd drop Power Attack. With your somewhat sub-par stats, you won't make much use of it. Expertise is MUCH better for you, even better than the 40 HP you get by 14 CON. What Expertise does for you is give you\u00a0A LOT OF\u00a0flexibility with AB and AC to use in different situations. If you need more AC in a certain encounter, you can Expertise / Taunt, then fight in Expertise mode for the next 6 rounds gaining +1 AB and +5 AC on a max Taunt roll, rinse and repeat. If you need more AB, you Expertise / Taunt, then fight without Expertise for +6 AB on a max Taunt roll. In both scenarios, you make good use of Expertise for a \"free\" +5 AC when taunting. It's good to note that Divine Shield doesn't work while Taunting (whether in Expertise or not), because it's Dodge AC and Taunt is a non-combat action, so if you're planning to Taunt, just use DS after the Taunt is resolved.<br/>\n<br/>\n Then you can also drop Extra Turning (and be more economical with your DM / DS) and add IKD with the reworked stats.<br/>\n<br/>\n You're half-right bout capping CHA with gear. You can if the gear is good enough and you roll a good enough number on the spells. AoG is the only one that is fixed at +4, the others are d4 +1, so they range from 2-5. A +5 Nymph's Cloak would assure a capped CHA, but IDK if that's available where you play. You also need to factor in being dispelled, which you can for most of the build's life. Undispellability (by all spells except for Mord's) is attained at level 24 in a caster class IIRC, which your build only gets at level 39.<br/>\n<br/>\n You can convert a pre-epic feat into an epic one by going Paladin 15 CoT 5 pre-epic, in which case I'd drop Improved Critical and maybe consider switching weapons. Or you can simply not take IKD (I'd favor Expertise over IKD for this guy), or you can even take it in Epics with a CoT bonus Feat. Also, GMW and Divine Favor cap at level 15, so you're hindering yourself by waiting all the way to level 23 for that 15th pally level. I would go for 15/5 pre-epic no matter what, just for the buff caps, even if you end up taking IC with that feat. I don't see any other epic feat that I'd want for this build anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n Another minor thing would be to swap Alertness with Iron Will. I reckon a boost to Will saves is more important than a boost to some skills you don't even have ranks on :D<br/>\n<br/>\n Other than these few things, it looks very solid!<br/>\n<br/>\n BTW, I'm curious, what don't you conform to in the pally guide?<br/>\n<br/>\n About Empyre's build, it gives up a lot defensively to give a little more offensively. The 6 damage is nice, but IMO not that important for this guy. You have loads of divine\u00a0damage with Divine Might and Holy Sword\u00a0and magical damage with\u00a0Divine Favor\u00a0to apply, both of which are really hard to resist\u00a0. I'd stick with CoT. Good job!<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div></div>"

      "content": "<div>I like your thought about hitting Paladin 15 immediately. It makes the most of your spell slots, and gets maxed out GMW and Divine Favor as you said, so my newest version starts with 15 levels of Paladin, then 5 levels of CoT. I don't mind taking a non-epic feat in an epic level because, quite honestly, there's nothing else I want there in this build, since I'm not buffing up Smite.<br/>\n<br/>\n Next, some notes pn the feats I take. I know I'm preaching to the choir on some of this, but I'm typing out my thought process.<br/>\n<br/>\n As you can tell, the biggest problem with this build is feat starvation. Due to having to take Iron Will and Alertness, that takes up slots. Also, I cannot drop Power Attack; it's required to get Divine Might and Divine Shield.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n I drop Extra Turning. Charisma will be kept high and so A) more uses of turn undead (And thus DM/DS), B) DM/DS last longer, and of course C) their effects increase. So the increased number of uses plus the increased length, lets drop Extra Turning.<br/>\n<br/>\n Extend Spell. With the number of Pally levels I'm taking, Bulls, GMW, Eagle's, will last forever. Bless, Aura of Glory, Aid, Freedom will all last a good amount of time as well. However Divine Favor is 1 turn, Prayer is 1 Round per level, Holy sword is one round per level. Extend spell will be really useful in making the most of my limited spell slots in keeping those up. Therefore I will keep that feat. It's not -necessary- however.<br/>\n<br/>\n So that leaves 1 paladin level feat, and 3 CoT bonus feats to slot some combat feats, at levels 3, 17, 19, and 22. A list:<br/>\n Cleave<br/>\n Improved Critical<br/>\n Blind Fight<br/>\n Knockdown<br/>\n Improved Knockdown<br/>\n Expertise<br/>\n<br/>\n - Improved Critical can be taken or left alone. This is a high Cha Divine Might build. Therefore I choose Scimitar, and Improved Critical for the increased range, as DM can crit. If this were an Str build, I would likely not take Improved Critical.<br/>\n - I hate whiffing. Blind Fight is taken.<br/>\n - Knockdown is horribly useful. That gets taken.<br/>\n -\u00a0I opt to take Cleave in the level 3 slot.\u00a0It's usefulness as an offensive weapon is good, particularly at low levels where a Paladin will struggle a little.<br/>\n - To take Expertise and/or Improved Knockdown, Int must be at 14. I am going to opt to not increase int, though if I did take IKD, I'd replace cleave.<br/>\n<br/>\n If I were taking Longsword, I would likely go Cleave, Blind Fight, Knockdown, Improved Knockdown.<br/>\n<br/>\n LOTS of choices.<br/>\n<br/>\n I was pondering the Rogue route. You could even keep 15/5 at level 20, pick up a rogue level at level 22 and 37, doing massive skill dumps then. That gets you evasion too (quite late but still.) But I'm sticking with the Paladin/Harper Scout combo. Is it the most powerful build? No, it's not. However the 3 classes synergize well, and I like it thematically. Besides, I'll go play the Tear of the Dragon build someday and see what getting a little bit of everything is all about. Anyways I digress, back to this build...<br/>\n<br/>\n So with that said, this is the build that I think I'm happy with for now. It has massive saves, Good BAB, Undispellable Paladin buffs, Tumble, Cats Grace (ah, another reason to take Extend spell - that will be cast at Harper level), and divine happiness. I opted to dump skill points into Listen. I don't see the need for spellcraft with saves already at super high levels. A case could be made for concentration.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Paladin(25), Champion of Torm(10), Harper Scout(5), Human<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 15 (20)<br/>\n DEX: 8<br/>\n CON: 14<br/>\n WIS: 14<br/>\n INT: 12<br/>\n CHA: 14 (28)<br/>\n<br/>\n Human: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n 01:Paladin(1):Power Attack, Weapon Focus: Scimitar, {Divine Grace, Divine Health, Lay on Hands}<br/>\n 02:Paladin(2):{Aura of Courage, Smite Evil}<br/>\n 03:Paladin(3):Cleave, {Remove Disease, Turn Undead}<br/>\n 04:Paladin(4):STR+1, (STR=16)<br/>\n 05:Paladin(5<br/>\n 06:Paladin(6):Divine Might<br/>\n 07:Paladin(7<br/>\n 08:Paladin(8):CHA+1, (CHA=15)<br/>\n 09:Paladin(9):Extend Spell<br/>\n 10:Paladin(10<br/>\n 11:Paladin(11)<br/>\n 12:Paladin(12): CHA+1, Divine Shield, (CHA=16)<br/>\n 13:Paladin(13)<br/>\n 14:Paladin(14)<br/>\n 15:Paladin(15): Iron Will<br/>\n 16:Champion of Torm(1): CHA+1,(CHA=17)<br/>\n 17:Champion of Torm(2): Improved Critical: Scimitar, {Sacred Defense}<br/>\n 18:Champion of Torm(3): Alertness<br/>\n 19:Champion of Torm(4): Blind Fight<br/>\n 20:Champion of Torm(5): CHA+1,{Divine Wrath}, (CHA=18)<br/>\n 21:Harper Scout(1): Great Charisma I, Great Charisma II, {Bardic Knowledge}, (CHA=20)<br/>\n 22:Champion of Torm(6): Knockdown<br/>\n 23:Harper Scout(2): {Deneir's Eye, Sleep}<br/>\n 24:Paladin(16): STR+1, Great Strength I, (STR=18)<br/>\n 25:Champion of Torm(7)<br/>\n 26:Champion of Torm(8): Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword<br/>\n 27:Harper Scout(3): Great Charisma III, {Cat's Grace, Tymora's Smile}, (CHA=21)<br/>\n 28:Champion of Torm(9): CHA+1, (CHA=22)<br/>\n 29:Champion of Torm(10): Armor Skin<br/>\n 30:Paladin(17): Great Strength II, (STR=19)<br/>\n 31:Paladin(18)<br/>\n 32:Harper Scout(4): STR+1, {Eagle's Splendor, Lliira's Heart}, (STR=20)<br/>\n 33:Paladin(19): Great Charisma IV, (CHA=23)<br/>\n 34:Paladin(20)<br/>\n 35:Paladin(21)<br/>\n 36:Paladin(22): CHA+1,Great Charisma V, (CHA=25)<br/>\n 37:Harper Scout(5): Great Charisma VI, {Craft Harper Item, Invisibility (Harper)}, (CHA=26)<br/>\n 38:Paladin(23): Epic Prowess<br/>\n 39:Paladin(24): Great Charisma VII, (CHA=27)<br/>\n 40:Paladin(25): CHA+1,(CHA=28)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 460<br/>\n Skillpoints: 182<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 39/34/32<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses: Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +2<br/>\n BAB: 30<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 38 (melee), 30 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 19/30<br/>\n Spell Casting: Paladin(4)<br/>\n Alignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\n Discipline 43(48), Listen 29(33), Lore 6(12), Persuade 8(17), Search 4(5), Taunt 43(52), Tumble 40(39), remaining skillpoints 5<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Discipline(4), Lore(4), Persuade(4), Taunt(4),<br/>\n 02:Discipline(1),Lore(1),Persuade(1),Taunt(1),<br/>\n 03:Discipline(1),Lore(1),Persuade(1),Taunt(1),<br/>\n 04:Discipline(1),Persuade(1),Taunt(1),Save(1),\u00a0<br/>\n 05:Discipline(1),Persuade(1),Search(1), Taunt(1),<br/>\n 06:Discipline(1),Search(1), Taunt(1),<br/>\n 07:Discipline(1),Search(1), Taunt(1),<br/>\n 08:Discipline(1),Search(1), Taunt(1),<br/>\n 09:Discipline(1),Taunt(1),Save(2),\u00a0<br/>\n 10:Discipline(1),Taunt(1),Save(4),\u00a0<br/>\n 11:Discipline(1),Taunt(1), Save(6),\u00a0<br/>\n 12:Discipline(1),Taunt(1), Save(8),\u00a0<br/>\n 13:Discipline(1),Taunt(1), Save(10),\u00a0<br/>\n 14:Discipline(1),Taunt(1), Save(12),\u00a0<br/>\n 15:Discipline(1),Taunt(1), Save(14),\u00a0<br/>\n 16:Discipline(1),Save(17),\u00a0<br/>\n 17:Discipline(1),Save(20),\u00a0<br/>\n 18:Discipline(1),Save(23),\u00a0<br/>\n 19:Discipline(1),Save(26),\u00a0<br/>\n 20:Discipline(1),Save(29),\u00a0<br/>\n 21:Discipline(1),Listen(11), Tumble(20),Save(3),\u00a0<br/>\n 22:Discipline(1),Save(6),\u00a0<br/>\n 23:Discipline(1),Tumble(5), Save(6),\u00a0<br/>\n 24:Discipline(1),Taunt(9),\u00a0<br/>\n 25:Discipline(1),Save(3),\u00a0<br/>\n 26:Discipline(1),Save(6),\u00a0<br/>\n 27:Discipline(1),Listen(6), Tumble(5),<br/>\n 28:Discipline(1),Save(3),\u00a0<br/>\n 29:Discipline(1),Save(6),\u00a0<br/>\n 30:Discipline(1),Taunt(6),Save(3),\u00a0<br/>\n 31:Discipline(1),Taunt(1),Save(5),\u00a0<br/>\n 32:Discipline(1),Listen(5), Tumble(5),<br/>\n 33:Discipline(1),Taunt(2),Save(1),\u00a0<br/>\n 34:Discipline(1),Taunt(1),Save(3),\u00a0<br/>\n 35:Discipline(1),Taunt(1),Save(5),\u00a0<br/>\n 36:Discipline(1),Taunt(1),Save(7),\u00a0<br/>\n 37:Discipline(1),Listen(7), Tumble(5),<br/>\n 38:Discipline(1),Taunt(2),Save(1),\u00a0<br/>\n 39:Discipline(1),Taunt(1),Save(3),\u00a0<br/>\n 40:Discipline(1),Taunt(1),Save(5),\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>Why not Paladin 29/HS 5/ FTR 6 Instead of Pal 25/ Ftr 10/ HS 5?<br/>\n Much better caster level this way, no? ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, you have to consider why the Smiting Pally can escape with such low's AB's and that's because of his Smiting ability. On a non-smiitng Paladin you need AB over 40 to be fun to play (and yes, that includes the +8 from his innate buffs). I would also drop Toughness like a stone, Cleave too in favour of Improved Critical (especially with a scimitar), Extend spell and Extra Turning. Blind-Fight is essential, as is Knockdown of course. Expertise meh... not so much since you have Divine Shield for +12/+15 AC.<br/>\n<br/>\n Personally if i would make a non-smiitng Paladin, i would opt for at least 22 strength, your saves in the last build are overwhelming since you will get another universal +6 from your charisma buffs and more when you buff your constitution and other abilities. You don't need that much.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Syphyreal,<br/>\n<br/>\n Your statement says a little about your playstyle. I don't know where you plan on playing this build, but if you like Cleave, it says that you're in the habit of fighting multiple foes at the same time. If your toon is going through the OC, that's fine, as it's hardly an issue, but if not, then you should probably read my Playing Better guide in the Game Guides section. I used to LOVE Cleave. In fact, all my first melee builds had it. Nowadays, it's little more than a requirement for BG and DevCrit. The reason for that is simple, I learned how to play the game against tough foes by taking countless dirtnaps on WoG. I describe my evolution as a player in the beginning of the topic, so you can have an idea of how I \"learned\". That also explains why you want HP so much (you need it if you're constantly getting attacked by multiple foes).<br/>\n<br/>\n 38 AB isn't bad, but it isn't top notch either. I like your split stats. 26 STR and 22 CHA seems like a good compromise that allows you to make use of all pally goodies. In that playstyle of yours, Expertise isn't really all that good, but once you start facing tough enemies 1 at a time (or a few at a time at a chokepoint with default AI), you'll find yourself using it a lot more often.<br/>\n<br/>\n I forgot about Power Attack being a requirement for DM / DS. I stand corrected. Sorry about that, it's been ages since I built a Pally!<br/>\n<br/>\n EDIT: Look who's back! WB Val!<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div>"

I'm learning as I go. I will take a read through your Playing Better guide and see what it has for me.</div>"
