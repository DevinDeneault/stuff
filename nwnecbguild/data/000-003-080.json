      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hello all,<br/>\n \u00a0 I am looking to get back into playing NWN on the Arelith server, but this time I would like a character that doesn't suck. I am terrible at builds. I have always made characters with RP in mind, but then I realized that I can still RP\u00a0<em>and\u00a0</em>have a character that can hold up well in a fight (I tend to end up with characters that do very little damage and cannot protect themselves very well). I want the days of watching people my level or lower hammering out two or three times the damage output than me to be over, so I'm asking this forum for help!\u00a0<br/>\n Some notes to help you help me:<br/>\n - I don't do too well with spellcasting classes, but am not opposed to trying it. I am simply inexperienced with using them. I have used a bard successfully to some degree.\u00a0<br/>\n - I am looking for a \"spy\" type build, so rogue/monk/shadowdancer might be ideal. This is NOT to say that I necessarily want a \"stealth\" build, but decent stealth would be helpful. Good Bluff, Listen, and Spot are desireable, and Lore if possible.\u00a0<br/>\n - I am also hoping to dual wield (short swords?), so maybe ranger would fit in there somewhere? I have been reading that a monk with dual kamas is a popular choice, so maybe ranger levels are not necessary.<br/>\n - Arelith has a level cap of 30, and when you multiclass, you must take 3 levels of the new class consecutively.\u00a0<br/>\n - Some of the feats, spells, and classes have been changed, nerfed, or prohibited on Arelith. They have a wiki page you can glance at to see what they are:\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Arelith_Wiki\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://wiki.arelith.com/Arelith_Wiki</a><br/>\n<br/>\n I think that's about all I can come up with. Obviously, I'll answer specific questions for anyone trying to help me, and I appreciate any and all help greatly! =)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi there, Nephylos - and welcome! <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" />There are some great builds and builders here, but I have to confess that I'm not one of them. However, I hope I can help in terms of guidance, if you'll bear with me until someone else comes along.<br/>\n<br/>\n First off, I don't know Arelith, but I do know that there have been lots of requests for builds and guidance about that server. You'll find some polished, high quality ones in our Mid-Epic (level 30) forum. Always worth a look. There are also many Arelith-specific builds bouncing around in this particular sub-forum, so again, worth scanning through.<br/>\n<br/>\n Weirdly, there are several conversations going on at the moment here about monk/rogue builds, so again...(you get the picture).<br/>\n<br/>\n If these are your preferred classes (something between monk, rogue, ranger, SD), unless you're going for only minimal monk input, dual-wielding kamas seems to me to make more sense than anything. Some would say it's a cliche, but there has to be some restriction on the (to my mind) best class in the game. More attacks than you can shake a stick at, solid AC and AB - what's not to like? Sorry, getting carried away again. Essentially, what I'm saying is have a good old browse around the site and get a bit more \"feel\" for what you want to play - RP is an important factor in any build that isn't merely robotic.<br/>\n<br/>\n I appreciate that you'd probably prefer a straight answer, but others are better at that than I am. Personally, I'm just really pleased you're here!<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I recommend some discipline compared to none. It gives him a little chance to resist it, plus it helps against called shots I believe. As for light offhand. Yes. The weapon itself has completely changed into a light variant. But, it also helps the ranger gets all its dual wield feats free. I'll admit, IDK could prove useful. But, this is more PvM than PvP. (Although, it is sufficent. Due to it also counter balancing player races as 'favored' i.e Even though, they have drow. They still used the 'Elf' race type.<br/>\n<br/>\n Seems to have been working okay for me. 4-5 attacks a round, nearly 50-70 dmg per hit (a bit more with sneak attack.) Granted, most of the enemies will fall below the 'favoured' enemies I listed for him. IKD Imp. Exp, either is a personal preference. It's up for him to decide. I chose it simply to become harder to hit, but because mobs aren't generally hard to hit. I recommend IKD if he intends to PvP as a sole focus, however.<br/>\n<br/>\n There's no XP penalty anymore, and I suppose I could update that thread with 'recent' information. No doubt, by the time I fill it, it might as just be looking into the Wiki again. In a bit, I will go and post thoroughly the Feat, Skill, Spell, and Class Changes Respectively. So, if that helps, it will be up soon. I will also post the paths and gifts one can take, as well as the backgrounds. However, due to how big the wiki is I may not cover everything.

Read my Complete Guide to the Basics of Character Building in the game guides section.<br/>\n<br/>\n Rua, if Katanas have been changed in Arelith, I have no way of knowing. The standard penalty for dual-wielding is -2 per attack, so you give up a bit of AB for more APR, but that only works if your offhand weapon is light, which means small for normal size and tiny for small size creatures. Otherwise that penatly is -4, which is kinda hefty if the monster ACs are competitive. Make sure that's the case and if so, please post wherever it is that Hip asked you to :).<br/>\n<br/>\n About discipline, here's how it works. Suppose you're a level 30 characte with 55 AC. Being a DEXer, that's easily attainable. My level 40 DEXers have a MINIMUM of 65 AC hasted. Actually, the lowest AC I have is 66 in a +5 environment. You can reach 33 Ranks in Discipline, with +1 from your STR score, that's 34 + d20 = 54, which is still lower than your AC. Now, if you get attacked, it means that the guy rolled more than your AC, which is higher than your Discipline score, so you WILL FAIL the discipline check no matter what, does that make sense?<br/>\n<br/>\n cheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I kept 6 Monk levels to retain KD and IKD so I can ensure SA damage is dealt. I still get an animal companion (which is just cool) and all the dual wield feats afforded the Ranger, plus the benefit of dual wielding kamas and the speed bonus from the monk class with flurry of blows. I'm not sure how AC will turn out, but this build seems like a fast walking blender!</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

For FE I would choose sneak immunes, like undead and maybe dragons, but I'm not familiar with arelith, you know better what will you encounter there.<br/>\n I dropped two points from wis to get 18 starting dex. Ranger 10 only gets lvl2 spells, so the wis is enough, and the dex helps a bit with feats (only one great dex is needed to reach 26 at the end).<br/>\n I didn't bother much with the skills, I just put the point where Nephylos put them :)<br/>\n<br/>\n EDIT: I gathered a little info about arelith, and realized that some rearrangement in the levels is a must to fulfill the \"first 3 levels in a new class must be taken in a row\" requirement, but this doesn't change much, just the leveling order... maybe 1-3 rogue, 4-8 ranger, 9-11 monk and the rest as you like.<br/>\n EDIT2: instead of that heal I would get some trap setting... with my lvl spread and rog at first level I get 26 spare points, wich is more than enough for deadly traps.<br/>\n<br/>\n</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">I do like some of your ideas. You managed to get +2 AB even though our BAB is the same. You\u00a0squeezed out 10 more HP than my revision, but I got more skill points and higher saving throws. I think I like your idea of taking from Wis instead of Str to bump Dex up. However, I was able to get Imp Evasion by just choosing it instead of getting it free from leveling Monk, which allowed me to pump more levels into rogue and givng me Uncanny Dodge and more SA, which I like! =)</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Monk 6 for IKD, but I would take that 10th ranger, I like the bonus feat better.<br/>\n Pre-epic I prefer to take 4 monks and 7 rogue, you get one point better base saves in will and forti, while still get the same reflex and BAB.<br/>\n For even more skillpoints, it is considerable to begin with three rogue levels. This way you could get fairly good trap skills - <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2176824/Unravelling-the-World-of-NWN-Traps-A-Primer\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">check this guide</a>.

In vanilla only base ranks count, so 30 is enough.<br/>\n Why 31 in UMD?

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I know you're right, but it is my hope that choosing a slightly different set of skills won't hurt the build too badly in combat. In fact, the stealth skills, Spot, Listen, Tumble, and UMD are all essentials no matter what, I think. I even diverted 26 points into Discipline based on the suggestions you all made. The only thing I did differently or am thinking of doing differently is Lore instead of Set Traps, and I am waiting until level 30 to decide where to dump that last 30 points, so I have plenty of time to decide that. It may be the case that I decide much sooner to just start dumping those excess points into Set Traps. <br/>\n<br/>\n I am torn between Ranger 10 for a bonus feat rather than SA8. I'm pretty sure I have the essential Feats for my build, so I'm not sure which other Feat I would choose. The extra d6 every time I hit sounds pretty sweet, though. =P Am I overthinking it?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That is actually quite irrelevant IMO. The most important ratio you should have in mind is your own AC vs your max Discipline Check. That'll help you figure out how often your discipline will actually even come into play. If your AC is higher than your Discipline Check, you'll only ever use it when the enemy hits you on a natural 20. That's exactly 5% of the time. Even if your max discipline is slightly higher than your AC, that'll go up to 25% chance tops. And a 25% chance of it coming into play. You'd still need to ROLL a high number to be able to resist the combat feat being used on you. IMO Discipline for DEXers will only work in extremely low magic settings, where you can't get your AC high enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I look at each build as if it were a course. You can cheat to get the grades you need and graduate with a moderate proficiency in whatever skill you set out to learn. Or, you can endure the hard-fought path of actually pulling all-nighters studying and doing everything you can to actually come out of it knowing as much as possible about the subject. Now in this comparison, the knowledge you have upon graduation would be the level 40 power of your build. The \"cheating\" would be reducing the knowledge you have\u00a0by getting the marks without actually learning the stuff, or in this case, taking away from the final result (level 40 power) to make the journey (leveling)\u00a0easier.<br/>\n<br/>\n So as a rule of thumb, I tend to make decisions that will increase the overall power of the build at level 40 when I'm building, which also makes me aware of the build's weaknesses when I'm playing it. Then, in-game, I try to compensate the weaknesses that I know the build has with intelligent decision-making. As an example, on a Fighter 10 / Dwarven Defender 26 / Rogue 4, it'd mean not taking Rogue until epics to maintain MAX pre-epic BAB. And so far, I've played many such builds. I've always been able to find a way to overcome the challenges I face with in-game decisions. And I've played some pretty gimped builds, such as Edwin Odeisseron (Wizard 29 / PM 10 / Assassin 1), whose only Tumble and UMD dumps were at level 37, or Nathyrra (Ranger 12 / Wizard 10 / Assassin 18), who is a concept build that really surprised me, as I expected to have a lot more trouble with\u00a0 than I actually ended up having, because she was basically good at nothing, but once I figured out how to use the very few spells to the fullest, became a really strong \"spell\"sword. Spell is between quotes there because when you make a spellsword, you generally do it to cast high-level spells, whereas she only has the crappy ones LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for the NPCs rolling 20s 30% of the time, IDK if that can be scripted, but if it can, shame on the builders! So they can't make a decent AI script and they decide to cut corners by increasing the \"luck factor\"????? That sucks! But you'd still need to ROLL the required Discipline total to succeed. That's still a 25% success rate AT BEST! IDK about investing skill points with those odds. I think I wouldn't.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'm sure the community would laud your efforts. But it is easier to criticize than be proactive, I suppose.\u00a0 Human nature.\u00a0 Even in Brazil.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow... back to our regularly-scheduled program that has something to do with helping a returning player achieve his goals on the Arelith server.\u00a0 Apologies for the interruption, Nephylos.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
