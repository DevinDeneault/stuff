Arcane Archers) +/- Intervening Terrain<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Edit:\u00a0</strong><br/>\nAdjustments made after I discovered Terrifying Rage only requires Barb 15 and Mighty Rage only Barb 20.\u00a0<br/>\nFurther adjustments made - dropped Epic Fortitude, added 1 BAB by moving Rogue to epic levels, changed leveling split to Barbarian 20 / CoT 18 / Rogue 2.<br/>\nAdjusted images for the build.

      "content": "<div>As an aforementioned mechanical builder (otherwise known as a minmaxer) I would likely drop 1 rogue (as noted) and add 1 barbarian.  Then swap a Great Strength into a general feat and a barbarian feat into the Barbarian bonus feat.  With the spare strength I would drop 1 Str and bump 2 Int for the starting stats. Netting 1 more rage per day (7 total) and some skills :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, IMO, barbarian is one of the classes that needs some attention in NWN.  It does not offer enough to not take one of the other full melee classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith respect to build advice, I generally find that Barbarian is one of those classes that is a one trick pony with that trick being gather a crowd, panic the crowd and then gut the crowd.  Personally I would spec into great sword or axe and go two handed.  Drop to sword and board when you need a moment to heal.  This lets you make the most out of your rage in my experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>"

I would likely focus on that over Improved Knockdown by default as a result focusing on making that DC as high as possible.  I would probably drop one of the save skills over SF: Intimidate but that really would be dependant on end game stuff, especially given it is a COT secondary.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hi everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the comments<br/>\nI made adjustments to the build, moving Rogue to epic levels (for +1AB), adjusting the level split to Barb 20 / CoT 18 / Rogue 2.\u00a0<br/>\nFit in toughness and great constitution as the Fort saves are great.<br/>\nIt hits 700hp+.<br/>\nI like not taking Rogue level 1 because it allows me to take Heavy Armor Proficiency from level 1, and not having to suffer on level 1 playing a low dex high str rogue.<br/>\nAlso did a search using DPA's filter for Barb 20+ builds.</div>"
