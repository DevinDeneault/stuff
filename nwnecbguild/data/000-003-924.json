However, one question popped up at this early stage that I'd welcome your advice on...<br/>\n<br/>\nWould a split of Ranger 25/ Monk 9/ Fighter 6 be a better option (with the final level or 2 of Fighter taken in epic)? I'd lose a Ranger BF and 1AC from Monk, but I'd gain EWS from the Fighter BF. What do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance</div>",

Thus, I'm binning WS and EWS and using the Fighter BFs for the aforementioned crit feats and reverting to Max's original suggestion of Ranger 26/ Monk 10/ Fighter 4.<br/>\n<br/>\nApologies to all. I suppose I could simply cancel the thread, but it might be a salutary lesson to others who may be equally dim, so I'll let it stand.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

Question: Why is this build better than the Crimson Nun, who apart from the awesome name also seems very nicely constructed?\n</div></blockquote>\n\nVery kind of you to say so, Cornflower, thank you! The early Ploughman build here actually reaches maturity in my \"The Farmer\" thread in the Level 40 section (I think it's still on the first page of that sub-forum).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not really about it being better or worse, it's different, so brings about different playstyles. Apart from anything else, I've been nagged ceaselessly about not playing casters, so felt obliged to try some Ranger buffs for the first time - just to keep the great and good quiet for a while. The discussions on both the Farmer and the Crimson Nun threads have been very valuable to me. I've (obviously) played both - though I've yet to successfully reload NwN to complete the Farmer's journey - and the Crimson Nun has proved easier to play at lower levels (up to around L12), but lags a little when epic levels are reached.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll go and refresh my memory now...<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",
