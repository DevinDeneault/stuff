      "content": "<div>Hi there, ProphetRisen, sorry it's taken some time to get back to you - I was hoping people who played on various PWs would be falling over themselves here. But no.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm afraid I'm not a PW player, but the rest of this sub-forum should be helpful. What I can say is that there's a lot of input here from folk who play on World of Greyhawk (WoG) and, over the last year or two, Arelith appears to have a lot of acolytes. The latter is capped at level 30 and has many distinct features, which you can find in the Arelith thread somewhere in this sub-forum (I get scared just wandering into this area, so don't ask for specifics from me!)<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",
