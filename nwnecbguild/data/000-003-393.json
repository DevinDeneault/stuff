      "content": "<div>I had this crazy idea of making builds inspired by the classes in Team Fortress 2. They are only ideas now, but I hope to flesh them out eventually. Here they are, in no particular order:<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Scout:</strong> Monk for speed plus either Ranger, the traditional D&amp;D scout, or Rogue because TF2's Scout reminds me of Tomi.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Medic:</strong> Cleric with Healing as one of his domaigns, and the other domaign is either Earth for Stoneskin and Energy Bufrfer, Travel for Freedom of Movement and Haste, Trickery for Improved Invisibiolity, or War for Cat's Grace and Aura of Vitality<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Demoman:</strong> Dwarf Barbarian<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Soldier:</strong> Fighter, maybe with foci in 2 or 3 weapons<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Heavy Weapons Guy:</strong> Fighter / DD / WM with a 2-handed weapon, proabably a great axe to go with being a Dwarf<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Spy:</strong> Rogue / SD<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Sniper:</strong> Bard / AA<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Engineer:</strong> 1 level of Cleric with Animal domaign for stronger Summon Creature spells and Death domaign for Negative Plane Avatar, plus Wizard for his familiar and focusing on summoning spells, plus maybe PM 10 for even more summons<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Pyro:</strong> Sorcerer 30 /  RDD 10, focusing on flame-based spells</div>",
