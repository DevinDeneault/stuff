I'm puttering around in a Drow cleric right now designed as a caster. And not doing toooooo badly. But I'd like a Wizard I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd like to ensure my summons are strong, so I can have my familiar then a second minion to do my bidding.<br/>\nThe idea here is that if the event came to it where I needed to take out another player, I'd have the ability.<br/>\nAnd I suppose the issue creeps in where I'm limited to level 28, as Amia has a level 30 limit, and Drow are ECL+2<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you need any further info I'd be happy to provide it <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nOlly<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
