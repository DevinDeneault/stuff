      "content": "<div>Lethal axes (Bard 20/ Fighter 10/ RDD 10)<br/>\nI was thinking of trying the difficult throwing axe build.  So I looked through various RDD builds, and didn\u2019t find much that took on the throwing weapon.  Ideally, bard, RDD, and then one other class.  PM would be nice, but that causes feat starving.  So I was looking at fighter or champion of Torm as the third class.  Looking through those builds the only one I found to be boosting dex beyond 16 while maintaining a high enough strength for devastating critical was an IWA build called<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build278312.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Whirling Dever</a>.  The build was not commented well as it was made during the 1.68 the only patch to cause whirlwind attack to have a decreasing progression.  It now appears quite solid for the task of getting as many devastating criticals as possible against a large mob.  Anyway, back to this build, I did find somewhat of a compromise in Halfling (+1 throwing +1 small size) which really helps this devastating throwing build out.<br/>\nThe build can be used to automatically silence mages and avoid damage shields by high damage ranged throws.  It can also be used to throw at a distance, and the shield will really be a boon for the AC once the magical equipment begins to be found.  Also, unlike the bow counterparts, this one does not need the mighty property, because that property (in infinite amount) is inherent to the throwing axe.<br/>\n<br/>\nHalfling, True Neutral<br/>\nPvM/PvP 1-40 (Designed around normal +5 by level 40 environments)<br/>\nStrength 14 (26)<br/>\nDexterity 18 (28)<br/>\nConstitution 8 (10)<br/>\nWisdom 8<br/>\nIntelligence 12 (14)<br/>\nCharisma 14 (16)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 344 (max roll), 272.5 (average)<br/>\nSkillpoints:  201<br/>\nSaving throws: Fortitude 24, Reflex 29, Will 23<br/>\nBAB: 26<br/>\nAB: 40/35/30/25 (naked, unbuffed) <br/>\nAC: 34 (mundane clothes and large shield, unbuffed)<br/>\nDamage (mundane throwing axe): 1d6 + 14<br/>\n<br/>\nSkills:<br/>\nDiscipline 43 (51)<br/>\nLore 8 (10)<br/>\nPerform 27 (30) Bard song level 16<br/>\nSpellcraft 41 (43)<br/>\nTumble 40 (49)<br/>\nUMD 42 (45)<br/>\n<br/>\n1.

      "content": "<div>It's a stylish build if I ever saw one, although axes are a bit suboptimal for dev crit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see by the class split alone that it is a good, effective build. Although LI is good, I usually split Bard16/Fighter14. You get enough songs. You don't have Curse song, which for a dev critter is really useful. I say it trumps both Toughness and Called Shot. Damagewise, with bardsong you'll be above most ranged builds even without Dev. Although AB is low for a ranged build, it's easy to boost.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see that you lack still spell, you sure you don't want that 16/14 split? Okay, as it is then, I'd swap toughness and Called Shot for CurseSong and Still Spell. A devcritter with lasting inspiration without CurseSong? Nah.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood job.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Grim, the thing with Curse Song is that you need to get close to make it target people, which for a ranged toon isn't very convenient to say the least. I was thinking actually backwards. I was thinking something like Bard 26 Fighter 4 RDD 10 for undispellability and a much earlier Lasting Inspiration, but that would require getting rid of some feats pre-epic, and for this guy I don't think it's doable without hampering the build. I can see him dropping Toughness and Blind Fight, but as I see it, all others are essential.<br/>\n<br/>\n@ WhiZard<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I'm not seeing something, but I believe Throwing Axes use STR modifier for attack rolls, so why all the DEX? Spell Failure? I'd stop at 18 and use a Chain Shirt. There are a couple of Elven Chain Mails in many servers that can reduce your chance of Arcane Spell failure if not nullify it. You can buff up without armor, then equip it and cast in combat with little chance to fail, and your AB and damage will be just 5 points higher. If there are no such items where you play, then I understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd also move some feats around for more playability and damage, mainly an earlier Weapon Specialization, which would require reworking the leveling. Is there a particular reason for taking Fighter levels so far apart from one another? Why not go Bard 1, then Fighter 4 straight, then Bard 2 and RDD 10, with one bard in the middle for skill dumps, and another one at 17? This way you get WS at level 5, rather than 18 while delaying RDD one level (you don't even have to delay it if you can live without the skill dumps).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you were to delay RDD 9 and 10 to epics and drop Toughness, then you could take Fighter 6 in epics and grab Armor Skin or Epic Prowess by anticipating Bard 8 to pre-epic (Bard 8 Figher 4 RDD 8). That would also give you some earlier spells, while maintaining the same BAB.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the idea, though, but I have to agree with Grim that Throwing Axes (or any ranged weapon for that matter) aren't tailor-made for DevCrit.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

While scoring a dev every now and then was powerful, most of the strength to this playing style was due to the mayhem that it created.  For PvP there was the attacks coming out of nowhere, sometimes rolling a fortitude save vs. death.  Yes, there were axe marks, but often enough they weren't enough to help players indicate direction.  When one saw me I often dashed off, leaving him the odd option of persuing me or rejoining the battle where he was also needed.  I found that coming to close quarters to unleash a curse song with that build, often just attracted the sneak archers, which I couldn't deal with in close quarters.  Occasionally a mage would find me and target an IGM so I saw the possibility that HP might be more valuable in that playing style.  When fighting scripted AI (PvM) the monsters knew my where-about much more quickly however, trying to dash past a party member to get to me often made them the subject of AoO and after colliding they were often also caught flatfooted, after which they attacked party members and I found another target to pester.  Actually killing one now and then, caused mass mayhem as I was too far away for many of them to directly target so they had to spend time moving around until they realized again where the battle was and resumed fighting in it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general curse song and toughness would be a good switch if the idea is close to solo.  However, I have found considerable niches that can make a long distance attack quite potent even without getting close.  As for called shot, I feel it is essential especially for dealing with the occasional straggler here and then that tries to run off in persuit of me.  But all this is due to playing style, and I could easily see a good curse song implementation followed by a retreat.</div>"

Having Heal Potions(or any potions) in PvP really makes it last forever unless you can kill all your enemies in 1-2 rounds.
