      "content": "<div>This is a good build. The weapon choice makes it thematic. The double weapons give a stronger base weapon damage than the small and tiny weapons, but you may suffer from never being able to go sword'n board with your focused weapon.<br/>\nI second Valerfor's suggestion of using CoT (unless you intend to play as an evil character)<br/>\nAt first I wondered why you didn't take both TWF and Ambidexterity at lvl 1 and before WF, but then I realized that you only reach dex 15 at lvl 4.<br/>\nIf I may suggest any tweaks, it would be to take Blind fight earlier and take Great cleave as late pre epic as possible. It would also be fine if you could find a way to squeeze EWS in somehow. That would probably mean at least 4 more levels of Fighter\u00a0 in epic levels unless you start with Str 18, Wis 8 and Int 10 and take EWS on a general epic feat instead of one of the Great strengt feats.</div>",
