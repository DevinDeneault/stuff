This will outweigh the benefit of having a heavier weapon with a little more damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other option is a double-sided weapon, which counts as a light weapon for the off-hand, but which requires the Exotic Weapon Feat (and is less flexible).</div>"

      "content": "<div>A lot will depend on what build you're playing, but a light weapon in the off-hand is always going to be better in AB terms - as Thorsson says (tiny for halfling or gnome, obviously). However, if you've got lots of Fighter and/or CoT levels you might have enough feats to take WF, WS, Imp Crit, EWF, EWS in two different weapons as well as the 3 two-weapon fighting feats. In that case, it's worth thinking about different damage types - slashing in the main hand, piercing or blunt in the off, for example.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",
