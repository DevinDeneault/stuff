I'm truly clueless about shifters, but someone said, build a Rift lord. \"It's easy just barbarian 25, druid 5 shifter 10, then you shift into the rift lord with huge immunities. Remember to get all energy resist feats and Epic DR1-2-3 also\".<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I was: \"??????\" I googled and was still \"??????\"<br/>\nApparently, the big advantage is that this shifted form gets a huge DR or DI.<br/>\nOh, traditionally, this build may have been on dwarven defender rather than barbarian, which I can't for my life figure out how that's combined with druid/shifter in any useful way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suppose this is so well-known it's not documented anywhere? Can anyone help out?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thank you guys! For convoluted reasons, I'll have to try the barbarian version I think. (On BSK you can re-build any toon you like, just delete it and keep all the XP, quest progress, etc, but you can't change race, or you can but will get weird problems. The only toon I have that I need to rebuild is a human.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll read up on stuff and see if I can come up with something that works well on BSK where DR is king, AB is queen and AC is more or less useless unless you can get it up to 75 or so.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne quick question: If you use the barbarian rage (which on BSK gives you both bonus damage and some DR) and then shift, you lose all nice rage effects I guess?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
