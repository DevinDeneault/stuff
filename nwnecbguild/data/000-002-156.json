I'm trying out a build in Aielund\u00a0 atm and can't remember for the life of me how to perform Craft Weapon (those who know the modules will know where). I've taken the requisite points in the skill, just can't recall how to get it done.<br/>\n<br/>\nIirc, there's no difference from vanilla in Aielund as far as this goes. And your assistance might also help others to apply the skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for helping the numpty.</div>",
