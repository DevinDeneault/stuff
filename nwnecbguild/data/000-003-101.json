I know the original campaign is easy, but I wanted to make a character to have fun, because it's been almost a decade since I played this game. I will accept your suggestion to increase the difficulty of the game.\u00a0About the race, I'm a big dwarf fan, but I like playing with humans.I do not know if the rule allows, but I remember using two Bastard Swords, pretty destructive above level 10, and even got many attacks per turn.But I do not care much what weapons to use. It can be Long Sword, or Short, or even axes.</div></div>"

And that's basically it, I do not look for any specific weapons, but I prefer swords. It's been a long time since I played these rules of the game, so I do not remember exactly the difference of using strength or dexterity, so indifferent to me. I believe that if it is based on strength, it will need heavy armor, if it is based on dexterity, it may be light armor, what do you suggest? I believe I will not need a ranged attack, I'll get a companion who attacks from a distance to accompany me. I'm a big dwarf fan, but I like playing human too. I love chaotic and neutral characters, do you know the feeling of being able to do as you please? HAHA I've never played with a multiclass character, so I have no idea of \u200b\u200bany, feel free to suggest. Like I said before, maybe I'll get a mate to attack from a distance, or maybe not. I want to play the original campaign and all the expansions, yes. I do not want to play PVP.\u00a0Again, thank you very much for your attention.</div></div>"

      "content": "<div>Okay then, we're getting closer. Pretty much a straight-up melee build, dual-wielding, chaotic and/or neutral. Still a few more bits and bobs, I'm afraid...<br/>\n<br/>\n Yes, Fighter gives you full BAB progression and many bonus feats, but has a poor set of skills and saves. Champion of Torm (prestige class) also gives full BAB and many bonus feats (not, of course, Weapon Specialization), but has incremental saves boosts every other level, and a slightly better skill set, but you can't be evil. Ranger gives Ambidexterity and 2-Weapon Fighting as free feats at level 1 (provided you wear nothing heavier than light armour, and if you want to wear heavy armour you'll need to take it as a feat), also has full BAB, gives an animal companion at level 6 and Improved 2-Weapon Fighting at level 9, and Favoured Enemies at several levels (we can come to that later, if need be), but no non-Ranger bonus feats and still a fairly poor set of skills and saves. Barbarian also has full BAB and greater hit points, as well as Uncanny Dodge, Damage Reduction and Rage, but again, poor saves (unless raging) and skillset, no extra bonus feats and is restricted to medium armour (unless you take the Heavy Armour feat). And they're your basic melee-type builds (Paladin is a non-starter with your preferences).<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, for the Original Campaign I reckon you'd only need 4 levels of Fighter, to get Weapon Specialization (6 if you wanted two different attack types - most swords will be slashing damage, but rapier and short sword are piercing, or you might fancy bludgeoning with a mace or small hammer in your off-hand). You can dual-wield bastard swords, but your AB <strong>will</strong> be penalised - you need a light weapon in your off-hand not to be, and you'd need the feat in Weapon Proficiency: Exotic as well. You'll also want a class that has Tumble as a class skill - to boost your Armour Class in the absence of a shield and/or heavy armour. A couple of Rogue or Bard levels would seem obvious for skill dumps (together with either Uncanny Dodge or Bard Song).<br/>\n<br/>\n If you wanted to play as a dwarf, that would leave CoT as the other class unless you wanted an xp penalty - something like Fighter 6 / Rogue 2 / CoT 10. If human, anything goes. It all really depends on what you have in mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n Hope this is helpful <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/11.gif\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT:</strong></em> Bloody hell - Hip's ninja'd me again!
