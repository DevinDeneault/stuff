Due to limited rests and several factors I would like to mix wizard with fighter for all the weapon and heavy armor feats.<br/>\n<br/>\n Currently the character stands as an elf with the current class outline. 3 wizard, 3 fighter levels and I am looking to maximize the spell Flesh to Stone.\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Flesh_to_stone\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Flesh_to_stone</a><br/>\n<br/>\n I look forward to any and all suggestions, would love to see what some of you wizards can do.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">With that gifting system they use it's hard to give you any specific breakdown.\u00a0 Apparently, the prereqs for the autometamagic feats have been customized so that also adds another variable that can't be quantified using standard AD&amp;D 3.0 toon building (CBC). However, with the spread you've provided, there are some options that only you can decide.<br/>\n<br/>\n Still Spell in pre-epic followed by the 3 auto feats in epic will be a given (no other way to cast in heavy armor otherwise, and a shield makes failure even more likely).<br/>\n<br/>\n With ftr4/wiz16 pre-epic your BAB will be 12 (3 APR, 4APR hasted).<br/>\n<br/>\n You are committed to ImpDisarm and a large weapon w/o a shield else why would take disarm at all?\u00a0 There is no reason.\u00a0 Otherwise it's just a wasted feat. What?\u00a0 maybe a scythe?\u00a0 Not sure why exotic proficiency was stuck in there.\u00a0 Medium weapons and disarm don't mix.\u00a0 I would have gone with a Greatsword for disarm/impdisarm and saved a feat but that's water over the dam now.<br/>\n<br/>\n It's looking like you are going to be trusting in True Strike with your poor AB count.\u00a0 TS can't be stilled but perhaps Silent spell will gain enough slots.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n The other way would be heavier fighter pre-epic to gain more combat feats and BAB 16.\u00a0 That would be wiz8/ftr12 pre-epic to get that extra attack and probably the only way to hit anything without True Strikes in the queue. STR &amp; DEX are way too low to conjure an adequate AB.\u00a0 You could get EWS and Level 9 spells with a final split of wiz17/ftr13 but EWS will need to come very late, probably at Level 30, to get a solid discipline dump.<br/>\n<br/>\n You'll be needing to max conc and discipline, as high a spellcraft level as possible.\u00a0 I suppose Tumble 15 and perhaps another cross-class with Listen. Just about everything else must be cross-classed except a few non-combat skills.<br/>\n<br/>\n The main problem you guys have is no way to dump to a tumble class without committing 3 levels and that will really handicap your alternatives.\u00a0 In other words, something like Wiz24/Ftr5/Mnk1 isn't possible and those other monk levels really do nothing but make your buffs easier to dispel.<br/>\n<br/>\n The proverbial rock and a hard place IMO.\u00a0 If I was forced to try to get something out of this spread I would take 1 more point in CON and INT and the rest into STR. You've got 6 bumps left which will end up STR 18.\u00a0 I wouldn't try to venture any further calculating any Grt STR feats because you will have your hands full fitting 3 autostill feats in plus ICC (else why take CC?), EWF and EWS (I'm assuming you plan to take WF and ImpCrit at some point in pre-epic).\u00a0 Armor Skin and/or Epic Prowess would be nice but think you will run out of feats to get both.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I understand that shifter class had been banned on Arelith (so no basilisk shapes run around the server) but any CoT or high-CHA pally will be able to reduce the success of petrification down to 5% (i.e. only when they roll a 1).\u00a0 Add to that the fact that artillery spell casters and archers will never get caught within the range of this spell and I am dubious about how this plan will succeed, probably only effective against poorly-designed builds or those caught unprepared.<br/>\n<br/>\n I guess if I had to try to survive playing with this build, I'd just go high-mage (you still need to deal with SR) and use Invisibility and Greater Sanctuary to get within spell range.\u00a0 Take all the spell penetration feats you can to deal with opposed SR (will add +6 with epic spell pen).\u00a0 That means pump CON as high as possible in case your spells continue to fail... at least you'll have a high-damage acid sheath for recipro damage while you try to spam more petrify attempts and a large HP pool to take damage (not to mention your own Fort will be much better).\u00a0 Stacks of petrification scrolls are only caster level 5 but you'd still be able to force more saves and SR checks.\u00a0 Start scribing as many as you can afford.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
