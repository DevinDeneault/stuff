      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">...but I'm fixated on playing a Barb/Bard combo of some sort that actually uses CHA and doesn't see Bard as just a toehold into RDD-hood. I want someone with <em>charm</em>, someone with <em>smarm</em>, someone who can do<strong><em> great bodily harm</em></strong>. It all started when I had a high fever and saw a vision of a wandering barbarian who was so <em>foreign </em>to civilized society and, unintentionally, intimidating because of it that he figured he'd have to sing his own damn songs if he ever wanted an epic composed about his exploits. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm too old to be a n00b, but the moniker fits nonetheless. I played NWN OC when it first came out on disks, and dabbled in SoU/HotU when they too were in their infancy. Now that EE has arrived, I've been hooked all over again. I'm only playing PvM for now (OC is garbage but boy do I love Aielund so far) but I'd love to take a toon up to 40 somewhere/somehow and maybe even experience some PW action. I'm a huge fan of Mick, Valerfor, Max, and Stag's builds on here (can anyone say Paragon of Pain?!?) but that's not exactly how I'm vibing on this guy. He doesn't need to be evil, in fact I'd prefer if he isn't, so BG is right out. Barb/Bard/RDD but not the typical 28/2/10 build, more Bard in there? Something else altogether? Am I insane in the membrane for wanting this? Would it even work? Is there a way to make something *close to* truly epic out of this fever dream? Can one or more or all of you seasoned veterans help a brotha out?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Half-Orc for flavor maybe, but Human would probably be better all-around since I don't want CHA as a dump stat on this one. <br/>\n<br/>\n4) <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Class preference</strong></span> - Barb + Bard + surprise me = wandering minstrel of smashbashiness.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Melee preference</strong></span> - 2 Handed weapon (greataxe maybe?), or sword &amp; board; I could probably enjoy either.

On the first page Eastern Promises has a build called Death Metal Bardbarbian (Bard 20/ BG 4/ Barbarian 16) which is pretty cool - and the Blackguard can be changed for something else if you like the principle, as you say you don't want the class.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been trying to do something with Barbarian and Ranger for ages, but it just doesn't seem to work right for me (as you might have noticed, I tend towards the knuckle-runner end of things) - especially if lots of singing is involved. But I'm starting to wonder whether there might be some mileage in a Bard/ Barbarian/ CoT. Don't know if it's viable, but happy to explore, if you'd br interested.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers, and welcome aboard!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hiya Stag! Thanks for the reply. I've poked around in there, but mostly I just use the search function or Google to look up whatever build idea is floating my boat every 7-8 levels of gameplay when the burnout/boredom with my current toon sets in. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeath Metal Bardbarbian -- I heart that name! Being an actual death metal musician myself, that totally resonates with me (pun obvs intended); but yeah, not feeling the 3vil Blaggard vibe with this guy. CoT might just have some promise, though... CHA seems to work well with them, and it fits my concept of a character who isn't evil, just big and scary despite a decent charisma and \"well-meaning\" attitude. Bull in a china shop, and all that. Maybe his singing was so good (or bad?) that it caught the attention of some deity (not much for being railroaded into Torm -- thanks Bioware Devs!) <br/>\n<br/>\nI'll play around with your suggestions. If I follow the BardBarbian but swap BG into CoT, I like the idea of Greater Rage 5x and Uncanny 5 from Barb 16, full spells progression from Bard at 20, but am I missing out only going 4 deep into CoT? Hmmm, I'll have to have a drink and have a think on it. Thanks for the suggestions, and thanks for the warm welcome!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">This might not be terribly helpful, but I've had another thought...What about a Barbarian 15 or 19/ Bard 20 or 16/ Harper Scout 5? Again likely to be somewhat feat-starved (which was one reason I was thinking CoT - for the BFs), but if you take HS in epic levels you have a couple of potentially useful BFs available.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, for an extra feat human would be advisable, but maybe a sort of wood elf or a Daelan-esque half-orc could cut it as well (elf if going for a Dex build, half-orc for a Str one). Let's have a think...Presumably you'll be wanting WF, KD, BFight, Imp Crit, WFinesse (if Dexing), Iron Will and Alertness (if going HS) as a minimum, and Terryfing Rage, EWF, Armor Skin and Epic Prowess in epic levels. Then there's the singing and spelling feats you'd want for Bard. If you fancied concentrating on the singing, that might help in feat terms, but many things are possible...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're looking at PvM up to level 40 (Aielund should get you to 36-37), there are various options open to you. The OC followed by the Mines of Twin Summit trilogy; the OC followed by Aribeth's Redemption then Sands of Fate; SoU and HotU followed by Sands of Fate; and there's solo World of Greyhawk.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a few musings for you<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Sorry for mucking you about.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about a song-focused Bard 16/ Barbarian 16/ CoT 8 with stats (as a human) of STR 16 (30), DEX 10, CON 14, WIS 8, INT 14, CHA 14 (16)? I've yet to draw up a full schemata, but I reckon we can squeeze in (pre-epic) Lingering Song, Curse Song, Weapon Focus (let's go for Greatsword, shall we?), Improved Critical, Blind Fighting, Knockdown, Improved Knockdown (or Expertise or Heavy Armour Proficiency), Power Attack and Cleave (with 3 levels of CoT, 13 of Barbarian and 4 of Bard). Then in epic levels, 6 Great Strengths, Terrifying Rage, Epic Weapon Focus, Epic Prowess and Armor Skin. You'd take 8 natural strength bumps and 2 charisma ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe'd also have enough skill points to fully cover Discipline, Intimidate, Taunt and Tumble, one of Concentration or Spellcraft, sufficient Perform to hit 30 modified ranks, enough UMD to reach 33 modified ranks and a smattering of Lore or Listen (or Spot). All the saves should get over 20, and the BAB would be 29, and give a final AB of 43. The AC might be a bit sucky though.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think?

Bonus feats on every even level up to L10 (then every 4 levels), full BAB, and a not irrelevant +1 to all saves (Sacred Defense) also on every even level throughout, however many levels you take. 10 levels would normally be a sweet-spot, but I was trying for 16 Bard to hit its own sweet-spot for singing and 16 Barbarian so you didn't have to wait too long for Terrifying Rage (first available at Barbarian 15).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could make a Devastating Critical version if you dropped Expertise, Toughness and AN Other (though obviously not Weapon Focus or Improved Critical) for Power Attack, Cleave and Great Cleave, then lose a couple of Great Strengths for Overwhelming and Devastating Crits, but I'd be less keen, on balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I forgot to mention you get a +9 to saves vs spells and Uncanny Dodge (not that that's really going to make much difference with 10 Dex). I'd have liked to get a perception skill in (Listen or Spot), but other things took priority. Equally, I went for Taunt over Persuade - Intimidate was never a choice, you need it for your Terrifying Rage DC.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> And don't forget to strip before buffing!

Being somewhat nub-ish to Bards in general, is there an end-game reason that one is preferred over the other, such as longer boss-fights vs. not needing to cast it as often? Especially if doing the <em>Bard Song/Curse Song</em> in conjunction, it seems like more castings would be a good thing; but I'm not well-versed in the subtleties and intricacies of Epic Character building, which is why I'm here. :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Afraid in this instance it ain't subtleties and intricacies, it's maths.<br/>\n<br/>\nExtra Music will give you 4 extra uses of song per day, so at level 16 you have 20 uses. Each use lasts 10 rounds, so that's a total of 200 rounds of song per day (or rest period).<br/>\n<br/>\nLingering Song adds 5 rounds to the length of each song, so each lasts 15 rounds. With 16 uses per day, that's a total of 240 rounds of singing per day (or rest period). Which is 40 more than with Extra Music.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it's actually about getting more bang for your buck. Dull but true!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT:</strong></em> Of course, with the Lasting Inspiration feat, it becomes a largely redundant question, as each of your songs will last 100 rounds. But you need 20 levels of Bard for that (totalling 2,000 rounds per day, thus never really off) which we don't have here, sorry!<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></em> As a general rule of thumb, Extra Music is the more useful feat up to Bard 8 ( a total of 120 rounds), when Lingering Song gives the same duration but fewer songs. Alas, you can't simply replace one with the other, so I was thinking long-term. You can, of course, swap when you take the Lingering Song and Curse Song feats in this build, but I thought Lingering was the more effective early choice.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks Stag, that makes sense. Since it's only simple math, not game subtleties, I might ponder this further. <br/>\n<br/>\nSince I'm planning on using both Bard Song and Curse Song, I wonder if having more <em>castings </em>would be more useful than more <em>rounds of active song</em>? My thinking being, at Bd L16 with Lingering Song I would get 16 uses/day which, if I use BS/CS in unison every time, equals 8 castings of each. On the other hand, if I went with Extra Music, I would get 10 castings of each. I understand that LS means those 8 will last longer, but I wonder which is better from a situational perspective, length or number of castings? I guess the question comes down to whether I would rather have more opportunities to cast each buff and debuff between resting, or whether I would want less castings of each (but with more duration) between naps. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is pretty interesting stuff! I really didn't expect my fever-delerium-induced character idea would give me so much to think about. <br/>\n<br/>\nTL;DR, I'm going down the rabbit hole! I might play it both ways and see which one I personally enjoy more. :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That way you could take Extra Music at level 3, Curse Song at level 15 and Lingering Song at 18.<br/>\n<br/>\nSound better for you?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">To be honest, I went for a feat that could help with the fairly sucky AC (understanding that Song/Curse will help anyway, but Rage nullifies some of that). The Expertise/ Taunt combo is a happy by-product. However, I confess to being unclear how many things we can have active at one time - Song/ Curse/ Rage/ Expertise/ Taunt - I can't promise they'll all work together. I'm sure someone else will know...<br/>\n<br/>\nA second confession, I also tend to skip on the Expertise feat (again, unless it's a build whose AC is a bit shonky) - something else always seems more worthwhile. However, on WoG, for example, it's almost compulsory to take it (and maybe its big brother as well). It's also very handy for those loons who play on hardcore rules (no offence, Mick and Mirnaia!). But for most modules it's a \"nice to have\" rather than \"must have\" feat, I find. Essentially, you'll stand less chance of dying at early levels - always handy - even if you're struggling to hit stuff, while at later levels and with (hopefully) arse-kicking AB, it's still very useful if you're taking too many hits.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

They also cannot use expertise or any meta-magic feats. Neverwinter Nights is more simplistic than that, so I created a Barbarian is PGC3 right now &amp; checked it to be sure &amp; it is as I suspecting it would be. Barbarians CAN use expertise without a problem even under the influence of rage, keep in mind that there is a slight delay (I suspect 1 round or less) before you can activate the feat if you have just used your rage ability. \u00a0 <br/>\nSo the answer is, Yes you can.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

There are plenty of high quality longswords and scimitars throughout Aielund. Personally, I'd go for longsword (sounds boring, but I'm thinking long-term here, while avoiding spoilers.) I could even make a case for dropping Toughness and taking Exotic Weapons and going for either katana or bastard sword, but it appears from another thread that EE might have some issues with how Aielund implements katana, though there are still some spectacular ones out there, and ...\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>You're likely to have someone along with you late-game - Act 3 and 4 - who's pretty damned good with one or even a pair of bastard swords, and it would seem counter-productive to have to share the good stuff around.\n</details>\n\nAlso, and I'll put these in a spoiler as well, because I know you don't want to know huge amounts in advance (though these aren't big at all)...\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>I don't know if you're travelling with companions or not, but they're well worth it in Aielund, and one of two romance options will crop up in Acts 3 and 4, which depend upon your gender - and they're both worth it, believe me. Secondly, and I hope you don't get upset by my telling you, but there's a mini Bard-only sub-quest in the theatre in Fairloch's market district in Act 2, which you just have to be patient with - you end up with some good Bard stuff to equip, should you wish.\n</details>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

She's currently level 15 and near the end of Nether Scrolls. The only changes I've made (thus far) to Stag's original vision are that I have swapped <strong>Lingering Song </strong>for <strong>Extra Music</strong>, because this character levels so slowly as a Bard (at early levels, at least) that having <em>more uses </em>of Bard Song just seemed better to me than having <em>one or two songs </em>last an extra five rounds. <br/>\nThe other change is that I opted for <strong>Improved Knockdown </strong>instead of <strong>Expertise</strong>. I know, I know; that's SUICIDE, right? Well, it just suits my playstyle better, I suppose. Spellcasters fall (literally) before me. And for those who don't fall down, I stole an idea from the <em>Mestil's Pale Emissary</em> build and fell in love with buying scrolls of damage shield spells. So in reality, I kinda want to get hit so my damages shields will proc and just melt my enemies by their own hands. <br/>\nBut aside from those two minor changes, I'm playing her as designed and LOVING her.

One of the reasons I'm so far behind in leveling her is that I decided, after being inspired by all the depictions of Gwynharwyf dual-wielding scimitars, to attempt a build of that nature. Alas, dualing scimmies is NOT a viable option. I then tried sword+board with scimmies, but it lacked all the flavor and reaped none of the rewards. So I went back to your original suggestion and have been cleaving a path of destruction with the Greatsword. And, for the record, The Tinoman is stupid broken OP. ;) I used that pretty much all the way through SoU, right up until I found the Shining Light of Lathander. It's crazy to me that you can get a +1 weapon within the first few seconds of the game as a level 1 character which is so powerful it can last almost the entire arc of the mod. Either way, I was glad to have it. <br/>\nI haven't gotten to the level where I take <strong>Toughness</strong> yet; would you suggest swapping <strong>Expertise </strong>back in? I'm so unused to playing with <strong>Expertise</strong> that I admit I'm at a loss as to its efficacy. It seems like those extra 5 AC against weak opponents are somewhat wasted, ala <strong>Power Attack</strong> (which at least serves purpose as a pre-req for other feats) since they probably wouldn't be hitting me anyway if I can still wail on them with a -5 to attack. Or am I missing the boat altogether on the usefulness of <strong>Expertise</strong>?

In WoG, for example, AC is king, so definitely Expertise. In SoU/HotU (particularly HotU), the gear gets so OP it won't (well, it shouldn't) really make a difference either way. It depends more on play-style here - Expertise is about trying to avoid being hit, Toughness is more a recognition that you will be hit but can take it. Then there's Max's Taunt/Expertise trick if you're nimble enough on your keyboard (which I seldom am). I included Expertise primarily in this build because of the previously mentioned sucky AC, and at least Expertise could help with that. In other words, I felt guilty. Singing and Cursing might be just as beneficial, with no down-sides. And just to be really annoying, Disarm is another decent option, particularly with a 2-hander, but you should probably take its Improved cousin as well, so maybe not. In other words - your call!<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and Power Attack can be helpful in its own right if you're playing a Dexer.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Update time. I just ding'ed 21 and she's still a beast! My only complaint (which is minor) is that it's been a bit annoying at times that my UMD is <em>just </em>shy of allowing me to wield/wear some of the best gear that I find. I'm wondering if another Bard level earlier in the build would be worth it, because so far that is the only thing standing in my way from doing literally any damn thing I want with the loot I find. Specifically, there was a particularly tasty evil-only greatsword early in Undermountain that I've been lugging around just waiting for my next Bard level. However, I think Enserric the Grey makes that obsolete (more on that later); but it would still be nice to have the option, especially as a younger character. As I said, that's a pretty minor complaint since my WarSinger of Gwynharwyf kicks A-double-S in all other ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, Rizolvir sure is handy! But before I dump zillions of GP at his forge, a question: do I get to keep Enserric the Grey into the next mod I play? If not, I'll start upgrading my \"backup\" weapon that's been rusting away in my Bag of Holding since I re-murdered those dead kings in Undermountain.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd speaking of Enserric, I'm assuming that was the \"pleasant surprise\" you were referring to? I must admit, I'm a fan! Much less annoying than Lilarcor from BGII (though he was endearing in his own right, too). Oddly enough, I didn't realize I could *TALK* to Enserric for the enchantment boost until I was already into the Underdark, but honestly, this character kicks so much arse that I really didn't need a To-Hit buff until then anyway.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I know you don't want to rehash the \"lingering v. extra\" debate when it comes to Bard Song, but I just have one more thing to add -- I spent nearly every cent I had to my name on a lovely item way back at the end of SoU which made Extra Music the clear victor. When in the Shadow Realm, I found an odd piece of parchment entitled \"Lyrics of the Lich\". Are you familiar with this magic item? It cost almost 50K gold (which at the end of SoU was pretty much all that I had), but it lets you use a Bard Song to cast Horrid Wilting. So, with Extra Music, I was able to cast up to 6 Horrid Wiltings per day, assuming I was willing to sacrifice a Bard Song to do so. Let me tell you that made the end of SoU almost pathetically easy as it was basically an insta-kill against almost everything I fought, and it carried me well into Nether Scrolls as well. Heck, I've even used it on Sabal and her gang of goons on the Isle of the Avariel a couple of times and it still does a decent amount of damage. No longer an insta-kill machine, but still effective in softening up large groups.\u00a0 :)\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, so fun!

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks, mate!<br/>\n<br/>\nGlad everything is going well. As far as the UMD is concerned, iirc you have 9 spare skill points to play with - you can always use 7 of those to boost your UMD to 37 (40) (there's not much point going further than that). Maybe it would have been more helpful to have pointed that out earlier - my bad, sorry! Still, you can drop a few more points in when you reach level 22, so not all is lost.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, Enserric was indeed that very surprise, pleased he's working out for you. Now, what follows aren't really spoilers, but might help in how you approach your time in the Underdark. After you head out on your quests (5, iirc), you'll only be allowed back into Lith Myathar a couple of times before the big battle starts - and you won't have a say in that. There are several implications from this, not least of which is how many times you can get Riz to upgrade your stuff. Actually, while I'm on Rizolvr, if he detects that your weapon is already supercharged from other things, he won't upgrade it, so be sure you've done all the upgrades you want before using the black pearl(s) in Vix'thra's realm. (You will meet him again in Cania, but I'll leave it at that.).<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, the major deal from how many times you return to Lith Myathar is that any quests you haven't completed will come back to bite you on the bum. The battle's nasty enough without a bunch of Beholders or Mindflayers popping up in the middle of it. So, think strategically. There are several ways to do it so you can complete everything, but I'll give you the one that's worked out best for me. Do both islands before returning for the first time. If you start with Shaori's Fell, you can offload excess gear to the Duergar merchant on the Isle of the Maker. When you come back, you'll be richer than god, so can do more upgrades with relative ease. Then do 2 of the 3 quests in the Underdark proper (doesn't really matter much, but I tend to do the Undead and Mindflayers, because there's another merchant for offloading excess stuff to in the village as you approach Vix'thra's castle, and the Illithid merchant who will trade with you does have some of Nasher's gear, which can be quite kewl once you get all of it). Finally, it's the Beholders for me.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and try to get some protection from cold gear before you go to the final battle. Just saying.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the update, and hope you don't mind the gentle advice - I know how frustrated I was the first time I played this bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks for the tips, Stag. I'm definitely not upset by minor spoilage or gentle advice. As for the UMD, just to clarify - it isn't a matter of putting more points in, it's a matter of max points <em>available </em>to put into it. I've maxed it at every Bard level-up and, with my CHA mod, it's at 24. That's just 1 point shy of the breakpoint to use basically anything in the game. If I had another Bard level earlier in the level progression, it would be the only way I can think of (other than perhaps buffing CHA by 2 points) to get my UMD to 25.\u00a0 But as I said, that's a minor thorn in the side of an otherwise nearly-invincible monster.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I've never played into epic before (hence being here for guidance) and completely forgot about the \"rule of 4\" in this context. I can definitely live without earlier access to another point in UMD if that's what it takes to keep the BAB progression where it is. As I said, it was a minor inconvenience at best. And I suppose that if I want to play a UMD-based character, then a Bard-heavy focus would be the way to go, which would be a different build altogether.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm getting it, slowly but surely. ;)\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

So, I've got my Warsinger of Gwynharwyf up to level 27 and I'm just about to beat the snot out of ol' Mephie. Let me tell ya, this character is <em>fun</em>\u00a0to play. She does stupid amounts of damage with Enserric the Grey, debuffs enemies with one of her numerous (extra) bard songs, debuffs some further with a rarely-resisted taunt, buffs herself with Rage which further debuffs most of her foes (thanks to that just-picked-up <em>Terrifying Rage</em>\u00a0feat), and then she just chews through her opponents. Granted, it's core content so I know it's not KVLT or l33t or whatever, but she's still a beast. I can't wait to get to Mines of Twin Summit and see how she fares there, especially since that will be brand-new content for me as a player. Once I've dinged 40 with the build, I think I'll take her over to BSK and see how this works on a PW.\u00a0<br/>\nThanks again, Stag.

And worst case scenario, I'm Chaotic Neutral, so I figure it's not terribly out of character if I *accidentally* stumble on (read: console command in) some gear that I wouldn't otherwise find.\u00a0<br/>\n;)\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
