If one can get around alignment restrictions by using Bard then one can get 4 attacks per round, but that is not allowed on many a server.\nChose greatsword for the crit range and to be able to keen it plus the extra Str damage with wielding a weapon in two hands.\u00a0\nOther good weapon choices include Scimitar, Scimitar, Scimitar, Heavy Flail and Halberd.\nAnd of course one can equip everyone's\u00a0favourite helmet\u00a0which is rapidly developing cult like status.\nNeed I say more?\nA\u00a0must buy\u00a0for the Antler'ed one!\n\n\nAny Lawful\n\nDEX: 13\nWIS: 8\nCHA: 11 (13)\nDwarf: (Darkvision, Defensive Training vs. Giants, Stonecunning, Hardiness vs. Poison, Hardiness vs. Spells, Offensive Training vs. Goblinoids, Offensive Training vs. Orcs, Skill Affinity: Lore)\n02: Sorcerer(2)\n04: Sorcerer(4): STR+1, (STR=19)\n06: Red Dragon Disciple(1): Power Attack\n08: Red Dragon Disciple(3): STR+1, (STR=22)\n10: Red Dragon Disciple(5)\n12: Red Dragon Disciple(7): STR+1, Blind Fight, (STR=25), (CON=12)\n14: Dwarven Defender(1): {Defensive Stance}\n16: Dwarven Defender(3): STR+1, (STR=26)\n18: Dwarven Defender(5): Improved Critical (Greatsword)\n20: Dwarven Defender(7): STR+1, (STR=27)\n22: Red Dragon Disciple(10): (STR=31), (CHA=13)\n24: Dwarven Defender(8): STR+1, Knockdown, (STR=32)\n26: Dwarven Defender(10)\n28: Dwarven Defender(12): STR+1, (STR=33)\n30: Dwarven Defender(14): Great Strength I, Overwhelming Critical (Greatsword), (STR=34)\n32: Red Dragon Disciple(11): STR+1, (STR=35)\n34: Dwarven Defender(17)\n36: Dwarven Defender(19): STR+1, Great Strength III, (STR=38)\n38: Dwarven Defender(21)\n40: Red Dragon Disciple(12): STR+1, (STR=40)\nHitpoints: 476\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 23/24/16\nBAB: 25\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 19/30\nAlignment Changes: 0\nDiscipline 43(58), Lore 11(15), Open Lock 1(2), Search 9(11), Spellcraft 43(45), Tumble 20(21)\n\n02: Lore(1), Save(8),\u00a0\n04: Lore(1), Save(12),\u00a0\n06: Discipline(6), Search(2), Save(9),\u00a0\n08: Discipline(1), Search(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n10: Discipline(1), Search(1), Save(3),\u00a0\n12: Discipline(1), Search(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n14: Discipline(2), Save(7),\u00a0\n16: Discipline(1), Save(11),\u00a0\n18: Discipline(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n20: Discipline(1), Save(9),\u00a0\n22: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(3),\u00a0\n24: Discipline(2), Save(2),\u00a0\n26: Discipline(1), Save(8),\u00a0\n28: Discipline(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n30: Discipline(1), Save(10),\u00a0\n32: Spellcraft(17),\u00a0\n34: Discipline(1), Lore(2), Save(1),\u00a0\n36: Discipline(1), Save(7),\u00a0\n38: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Save(2),\u00a0\n40: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(8),\u00a0\n</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
