I wish they did...I'd most likely be actually investing in initiative improving feats...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe wiki link<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Initiative</a><br/>\n<br/>\nshows all the modifiers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually think it is more broken than that wiki suggests. My thoughts stem from playing on a perma death modern zombie survival server, where even when I attacked out of stealth a dex 8 zombie, one shotting it, they would often enough actually hit me before they died...</div>"
