      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hey Hi all. I got a question for the expert builders here.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a. Dex X/Cleric/Rogue type build, is Ranger a Viable alternative to Monk?<br/>\n<br/>\nRanger would give Dex Cleric/Rogue build Two Weapon, Ambidexterity feats for free at 1st level, making it so that a 2 Weapon build would only need to take improved 2 weapon feat, instead of all 3 feats, freeing up slots for other feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nRanger 1, would also give +1 AB Pre Epic, and 4 APR. And good skills, and favored enemy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only problems with Ranger 1 in that kind of build is the loss of the 5 AC thru 20 Wisdom in a Monk/Cleric/Rogue build.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd since can get 4 APR thru Divine Power spell, does that make taking Ranger 1 Pre Epic, Redundant, because already get 4 APR thru Divine Power, and so Ranger 1 not needed to get 4 APR?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a way to get that 5 AC back that lost by not taking Monk 1, and taking Ranger 1 instead?<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes Ranger 1 giving 2 weapon feats, and favored enemy, enough by itself, because of Divine Power 4 APR, to make it a viable alternative.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that if can find a way to get back that lost 5 AC, that it could be a viable alternative. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I dont know. Maybe it would still be viable even without the lost 5 AC, and even if Divine Power gives 4 APR without Ranger 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts. Answers. Help?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">In the Ranger example, you actually don't want 4 APR in a Cleric build, as DP gives that extra APR - but at full AB, rather than -15 AB. Also, with the Monk example, if you use kamas or fist, Monk UBAB means not only are the number of your attacks increased, they decrease by in their likelihood to hit by -3 per attack rather than -5.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Going Rang9 for dual-wielding is almost always a waste when you can use Figh4 to get all three dual-wielding feats. There are some cases where Rang9 is useful, but in general Fighter is almost always a better choice than Ranger if you only want dual-wielding feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nRog13/Cler26/Figh1 or Rog13/Cler25/Figh2 would give you 1/2 dual-wielding feats, but there's no way to make up for the APR and AC loss of dropping Monk. You could also go for a Rog13/Cler26/Rang1 and\u00a0use the bonus Ranger feat for Epic Prowess / EWF which would allow you to reshuffle feats. However, as\u00a0gkorjax said you can't use Rang1 to qualify for ITWF.\u00a0Even if you did use these class spreads you wouldn't be able to go beyond 15 BAB anyway so you would still have 3 APR (which is a good thing for a cleric).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If you have 20 WIS, and with items and buffs reach 32, that's an extra 11 points of AC in a build with Epic Dodge. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
