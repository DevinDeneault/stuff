      "content": "<div>Hey, Hi all. I am trying to build a Assassin/Shadowdancer.<br/>\n<br/>\nI started with Monk/Assassin/SD, but monk didnt have spellcasting, buffing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with Rogue. So I created a thread asking for help with a Bard/Assassin/Shadowdancer.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter I got it up to 9th level(Bard 5/Assassin 2/SD 2, I noticed that its going to be a pain getting the 2 weapon path of feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso lack of Hp, lack of BAB<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I thought of Ranger/Assassin/SD<br/>\n<br/>\n6+ levels in Ranger would take care of dual wielding path of feats. Rangers would have the class skills, skill points needed. Rangers have good BAB, Rangers have good HP, Rangers wear light armor in a Dex Assassin/SD build, Rangers have buff spells, healing spells, like a Bard. Ranger/Assassins/SD have UMD to use buff, summon, items, scrolls, Rangers have a animal companion, and can cast a summon spell, and can use SD ability to summon a shadow to have 1 animal companion, 1 summoned animal, 1 shadow, 1 Henchman, 1 Ranger/Assassin/SD PC as a nice little party to handle undead or things that cant easily be dealt with by Assassin/SD, and if all that not enough Rangers have Favored Enemy. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo my plan is about 6+ Ranger Levels, high enough to get at least 2nd level Ranger Spells, if not level 3 Ranger Spells, if lev 3 spells does not raise Ranger level too high. 23 to 28 Assassin Levels, 5 SD shadowdancer levels to get HIPS, Evasion, Summon Shadow, Shadow Evade, Defensive Roll.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe feat path will have the dual wield 2 weapon path(Free), dodge, Weapon Finesse, Mobility, Expertise, Whirlwind Attack, Improved, Dev Crit, Knockdown, Blind Fight, Great Dexterity, Armor Skin, Prowess, etc<br/>\n<br/>\nThinking of Elf to start with Longsword, Bow, and to help with Knockdown Feat, unless Ranger class gets you martial weapons like Rapier, shortsword, that can be weapon finessed, then be halfling.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo thats the basic concept of build.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would you guys recommend, suggest? <br/>\n<br/>\nEspecially looking for help from Mick Dagger, Valerfor, Empyre, Steig, etc, but any participation from anybody would also be awesome<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso noticed that altho there is lots of Assassin/SD Builds, there are only 1,2,3 older builds that I have seen by digging that had Ranger/Assassin/SD.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any help, participation given.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike</div>"

      "content": "<div>Ok, Asturonethoriusaline<br/>\nAssassin has the UMD skill, and it is far more versatile than a couple of ranger spells. But ranger has a lot going for it, so building with ranger is one of the better options for assassins (according to my own assassin guide):<br/>\n<em>\"Ranger is the only base class with full warrior BAB progression that has stealth as class skills. Rangers can get 8 ranks in the stealth skills at level 5 and start taking assassin levels at level 6. Rangers are proficient with martial weapons and get the dual wield feats as class feats, with ITWF at level 9, leaving room for all the 10 pre epic assassin levels before level 20. The ranger requirement of dual wielding in light armor fits perfectly for a dexterity-based assassin. Rangers get several spells that help assassins work better. Ultravision helps pierce the darkness spell. The camouflage, one with the land and cat\u2019s grace spells also benefit assassin stealth, AB and AC. The trackless step feat improves stealth when outdoors.\"</em><br/>\n<br/>\nHere is my take on Ranger/ Assassin/ Shadowdancer. It is an elf. You can also build it as a halfling if you switch from swords to daggers.<br/>\nWe still differ on how many SD levels we want, but here is my take on it anyway:<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>\n<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></details></div>",

Please go look at the Wiki for what BF actually does. Whirlwind Attack is a pretty useless Feat on an Assassin Build (better read the Wiki on that one as well). Dev Crit Save is based on Strength and you already have an \"I win\" button with Death Attack.

Here I mainly use HIPS for crowd control, and I have never missed Expertise.<br/>\nThis is a Dexterity build! You need at least 25 Strength for Devastating Critical and here it is not even an option.<br/>\nImproved critical is in my opinion a very good feat that increases damage dealt. But here it is completely overshadowed by Death attack damage and I cannot give it priority. \u00a0Like Sneak attack damage, Death attack damage is (unfortunately) not muliplied on a critical hit.<br/>\nWhirlwind attack is something I only take to qualify for Weaponmaster. And even then I only use it to a very limited degree. If I remember correctly, WWA does not trigger SAs or DAs.<br/>\nBlindfight can not be replaced by Ultravision or Darkvision. They do different things.<br/>\nIf you start to remove WF, \u00a0EWF or EP and drop Great dex feats, this killer soon ends up with a pedestrian AB.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: Oops, Thorsson.

In chapter 2, perhaps the shady halfling character by the docks in Port Llast (Eltoora's also in the town on top of a hill) and the equally shady halfling in Luskan at the top of the slums? Chapter 3 (Beorunna's Well) gives you Eltoora again, and another shady halfling in the pub.

I think expertise is worth having on semi lower AC builds, and even sometimes on a semi high AC builds, and worth a feat slot.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter even more thought. Expertise is better, best on at least a semi melee tank, DPS build.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing I am forgeting is that while the Ranger/Assassin/SD can be a semi melee build between semi low to semi mid levels, between mid level and semi high levels, and especially at high, highest levels, the build is a hit and run, ambushing, ninja, stealth, almost insta kill build, that only uses AC when cant assassinate, and has to fight hordes, or dragon, etc, in a straight up melee fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving a higher AB and damage output, from a dex build, will almost insta kill, and avoid a melee fight, while a Dex based AC will help when forced into a Melee fight<br/>\n<br/>\nIn that kind of situation Expertise is 50/50 at best on whether help, worth a feat slot.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I can understand Expertise both not being selected as a feat, and being selected as a feat.<br/>\n<br/>\nInstead of taking expertise at level 9, after raising 12 int to 13 at lev 8,  I may wait until level 15 after raising 12 int to 13 at lev 12, to take expertise, if I take expertise.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thought is to see if either I can get by without expertise, or if expertise would be helpful. And if I have enough feat slots to take expertise, I can take it. And if not, I can then not take expertise in the build and take something else instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo at the very least, I think I should delay taking Expertise until later, if at all.</div>"

I retain a certain fondness for the campaign for 2 reasons: first, because it's the, well, first one; and second, it gets under Max's skin. But it really won't give you much evidence of a good build over a poor one. It matters more with the expansions (SoU and HotU), but really good builds will shine far brighter when taking on other modules or PWs. If you do fancy a tougher OC run, you could do worse than try Hip's challenge in (I think) the Modules section, and play it as it was originally built.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

      "content": "<div>Hey Stag altho the OC is easy, there is about 4,5,6,7 semi hard to HARD spots, and 6 to 11 times your PC gets killed, and about 13 to 25 reloads of earlier saved games.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe epic Red Dragon near the end of game in particular is quite NASTY.<br/>\n<br/>\nHigh hit,dam builds, and high AC builds(AC 67), struggle against it. It usually takes 1,2,3 deaths, reloads to beat that red dragon.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least thats been my experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the OC, while easy MOST of the time, is not always as easy as everybody thinks it is<br/>\n<br/>\nRed Dragon is easier when it tries to breath weapon you to death thru your epic evasion instead of attacking you, thus giving you time to kill it.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Well let's not even get started on AI henchmen/women in the OC. If they're not dying all over the place they're casting their best spells spells at the solitary wandering goblin rather than the handful of orc shamans waiting just around the corner. Thanks for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBelieve me, I'm the last person to have a pop at the OC, but I think I've soloed it since my 5th trip (twice with Linu, once with Tomi, once with Sharwyn and once with Daelan).<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a more general note, I think a lot depends on getting familiar with different styles of playing/combat. There was no way I could take on Klauth (the ancient Red Dragon) solo with a Dexer in my earlier days, because I'd only learned how to play one way. Now, meh. That's not me being cocky, it's about me having played a lot more and - more importantly - read and learned from the wealth of knowledge this Guild has to offer. And I'm still more player than builder: but I'm learning.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to SoU, when you start it from scratch (unlike when I first did - when I assumed it was a follow-on from the OC), it's a much more challenging environment, and good gear is scarce, that's when you start to notice the difference between good, poor, and mediocre builds at lower levels (and then it all gets dip-shit crazy in HotU). And, even with crappy AI, Deekin's worth it for companionship.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

      "content": "<div>The OC is supposed to be an introductory adventure, a module for you to get into the Neverwinter Nights world and D&amp;D 3rd Edition in general. That dragon is Klauth and he is supposed to be an Epic (CR 25) challenge in Faerun, so he is justified in being tough, besides you have a side-quest that halves his life anyway. I have more problem with the early 3D models of such creatures, the Infinity Engine (Baldur's Gate II etc) did dragons so much better, that seeing this ugly block of polygons totally destroyed it for me. I don't want to mention the crappy A.I at all, seeing a colossal strength 45 creature doing magic missiles instead of using any of its other options was...<br/>\n<br/>\nBah, I'll leave a link to the \"real\" Klauth below so you can witness his power,<br/>\nKlauth, \"Old Snarl\" =&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/wn/20030226a\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp? ... /20030226a</a></div>"
