I apologize for my English. <br/>\nI went back to play NWN on a shard that uses pre epic levels. [up to level 20] [No Elf]<br/>\n<br/>\nI've always played with arcane archers, but this time I would like to make a fighter/mage with dual sword [Rapier Maybe for crit 15/20]. Someone give me a hand for this build?<br/>\nIf possible a guide for leveling. [With feats and skills?]<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to those who have the time and pleasure to help me.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The best spells are from level 9, which you gain the first of at level 17. Trust me, we could build it for you, but it would NEVER be good. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, about the weapons, one thing you should know is that wielding a medium weapon on your off hand increases your attack penalty. Basically, don't dual-wield weapons that aren't small for normal-sized creatures and tiny for Halflings and Gnomes.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Do you want my honest opinion? It SUCKS! LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nAnswer me this question: what are the 6 levels of Wizard doing for you in that build?  Don't worry, I'll answer: MAKING YOU VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY WEAK!!! You're giving up 3 BAB points for the ability to cast level 3 spells. What are the spells that are SOOOOOO VITAL for you to take 6 levels of a 1d4 HD, 1/2 BAB class in a melee build? You don't even get to cast Stoneskin LOL. I told you, you CAN'T POSSIBLY MAKE a strong fighter / mage build for level 20. It just DOESN'T WORK!<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, that's exactly what you managed: a very weak meleer with very limited spell power. I tried to explain, but you weren't ready to listen. maybe now that I've told you your build is extremely weak you will?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you take just 3 LEVELS of Rogue, you'll have access to Use Magic Device, which is a skill that allows you to cast from scrolls. Furthermore, you'll have 2d6 Sneak Attack damage, more skill points, access to a better skillset, Uncanny Dodge, more hitpoints and you don't have to worry about spell failure from armor or shield when \"casting\". Plus, you'll only lose 1 BAB instead of 3. You'll also have access to Tumble as a class skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said, the only reason to even think of making a spellsword with Fighter and Wizard is to use HIGH LEVEL SPELLS in a build with good AB. You just can't achieve that in 20 levels, because you need to build BAB first, get your combat feats, etc.. and ONLY THEN, in epics, build your spellbook.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as an example, let me show you a build I made a while back that is a high level Wizard with good combat prowess:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/draconic-arcanist-wizard-26-bard-4-rdd-10-t2344104.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Draconic Arcanist</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, sorry to have been so emphatic, but you need to hear us. No matter how balanced your \"shard\" is, a fighter / mage in a level 20 environment will always be weak.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

A wizard/fighter is just a bad choice pre epic.<br/>\nCleric is probably the strongest you can build with. Make sure you take at least 15 levels of cleric. <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/independent-versatile-clergy-ro3-cl15-f2-t2349464.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This</a> is a strong cleric build.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also go with bard, EG bard16/ Fighter4. <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/battle-skald-bard-16-fighter-4-t515340.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Here </a>is an example. You may want to take still spell with that build (see the discussion in the thread).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother option is to play as druid19/monk1. You focus on building up wisdom. You can cast attack spells, buff up and do all your fighting in shifted form, escorted by your companion and summons. All your forms override con, dex and str, so you need not put any points there. If you take zen archery, ranged weapons also become an option.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You wouldn't be saying that if you knew what this build can do.<br/>\n<br/>\n2- As for the second one. It works with any weapon, but why not Bastard Sword? You have the feat to spare and it's one of the best weapons in the game, so instead of asking if it works with LS (which it does), I ask you: why not Bastard Sword?<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

This may help his cause.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: I forgot.
