      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">So here's a build I posted in another thread that I've run on several servers when I needed to solo certain bosses. \u00a0This is a straight up tank - wade in and obstruct enemies from the rest of the party. \u00a0You have the AB to keep them focusd on you. \u00a0This is also a reasonable soloing combat build. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm posting it here to get any last minute feedback before posting it to the level 40 section. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n The environment it's designed for are mid- or high-magic servers where you can get some damage bonuses on weapons (think Kharlindale or higher, basically +5 or better). \u00a0Like most dexers, this would probably be slow going solo on a low-magic world, especially with a -1 STR modifier. \u00a0I wouldn't play it there. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Pros:<br/>\n<br/>\n Good AB despite 16 PM levels<br/>\n reasonable melee HP<br/>\n Excellent AC<br/>\n Ability to switch between single and dual wield (typically I dual-wielded vs mobs and shield vs bosses)<br/>\n Great Reflex save and good fort save<br/>\n<br/>\n Cons<br/>\n 20% xp penalty

skill points and a feat), but that's going to cost you 2 AB and AC (1 for the starting DEX at 18 instead of 20 and 1 for small size modifier going away). \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n There were a lot of builds in the old archives with this class mix, but almost all of them were strength builds, were flat out not good, or both. \u00a0There was 1 dex build similar, Nimble Pale Master (Ftr12 bard4 PM24), but despite having 4 more PM AC, it's only a net of 1 AC better and gives up 5 AB and the saves are worse (25/20/29 vs 29/22/35). \u00a0It's an older not quite optimized elf build from 2007. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Also taking suggestions for a better title for the build. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Dante<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
