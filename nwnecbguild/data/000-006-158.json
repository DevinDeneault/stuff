      "content": "<div>Hi again!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Introduction:</strong><br/>\nI'm Orion and I'm back for another episode of NWN character building / experimenting, and can I say how much fun this has been.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now I am fascinated by builds that are able to 'do as much damage as possible', and as you know I created a\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/double-holy-kama-lady-of-vengeance-paladin-32-wm-7-t2355063.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Paladin/WM/Monk build</a> last week which I thought did as much damage as could be possible in the game with a modest setup (<strong>300 mixed damage / round without crits</strong>, <strong>450 damage / round with crits</strong>) and I thought definitely this could not be beaten in terms of damage output / round. Like I mean the character has 10 attacks + further buffed by holy might/eagle splendor/aura of glory, divine favor, bull strength and on top of that weapon master criticals.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell I thought wrong!!!\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI am pleased to say I have found a build which does enough even more damage. And this time, NO Weapon Master (phew, the feat progression is so painful)!\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to top it off, I found a way to incorporate the <strong>Devastating Critical Feat</strong> into the build. This means because of your 10 attacks / round, your opponent will on average, <strong>have to make at least one (possibly multiple!!!!) DC 41 Fortitude Save or Die, every round you attack them</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nDid I mention you get <strong>Level 7 Cleric Spells</strong> on top of it?<br/>\n<br/>\nIs this overpowered or what?\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will however, have to take a ride on the dark side to do so. Because it involves utilizing the Blackguard class. Welcome to the Unholy Hurricane of Death!!! I sincerely hope this entertains! By the way thanks so much for the feedback with my last post, it was very enjoyable to read.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThis time lets put a picture up\u00a0of our brooding dark and lawful evil protagonist who definitely looks like he wants to kill some things (custom, from AdreannaDrea's male portrait pack on Steam) alongside his faithful and uncharacteristically cute and innocent looking demonic chaotic evil Epic Vrock companion before we get down to the details.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/201905/10759084_b42d6a076f2f3bf9c70b7d171eb3abc3.jpg\"/><br/>\n<strong>The build:</strong><br/>\nAims to do a <strong>lot</strong> of damage. Through:<br/>\n- 10 attacks from double kamas / improved two weapon fighting /\u00a0monk, flurry of blows and haste<br/>\n- 3-4 attacks / round from your Epic Vrock companion (ie <strong>14 attacks / round)</strong><br/>\n- Attacks on main hero and minion further buffed with lots of damage per hit. from<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 + Cleric buffs (Divine Might, Divine Favor, Darkfire, Greater Magic Weapon, War Domain, Bull Strength)<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 + Blackguard buffs (up to 9d6 sneak attack, Bull strength)<br/>\n- Sneak attack frequency enhanced by<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0+ Blackguard Epic Vrock summon drawing aggression from enemies, knockdown<br/>\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0+ Up to Level 7 Cleric Spells such as sanctuary, invisibility, heal, word of of faith (AOE stun)<br/>\n- Improved Critical and Devastating critical +10 attacks / round means your enemies will on average, <strong>have to make one DC 41 Fortitude save or die, every single round</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nThere is some defensive capability as well from Cleric spells (including Improved Invisibility) and Blackguard Dark Blessing, Monk Wisdom AC which is also great to help you stay in fights as long as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nDownsides?\u00a0<br/>\n- He's evil.\u00a0<br/>\n- Lots of buffing means you might be vulnerable to dispel magic abilities<br/>\n- No big fireballs to cast<br/>\n- the build is M.A.D meaning Multiple Attribute Dependent (which is why cleric is good here, for the buffs)<br/>\n- some micromanagement is recommend to try to maximise the number of sneak attacks possible, especially since I haven't included Knockdown in this build (I prioritized Blind Fight)<br/>\n- low cleric caster levels is a pain if you want to stun someone with your spells to set up the sneak attacks<br/>\n- somewhat low HP with CONS 8, only partially offset by cleric spells, and I found it hard to get the Toughness Feat with all the other feats I had to get to Devastating Critical + Lvl 7 Cleric Spells<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>The Details:</strong><br/>\nHuman Lawful Evil\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Stats:</strong><br/>\nStrength 14 (25)<br/>\nDexterity 14 (15)<br/>\nConstitution 8<br/>\nIntelligence 14<br/>\nWisdom 14 (17)<br/>\nCharisma 14\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Spells:\u00a0</strong><br/>\nCleric 1: Divine Favor x4, Protection from Alignment, Sanctuary x2<br/>\nCleric 2: Bull's Strength, Endurance, Owl's Wisdom, Eagle's Splendor, Cat's Grace, Ultravision, Invisibility<br/>\nCleric 3: Darkfire x3, Protection from Elements, Magic Vestment, Invisibility Sphere<br/>\nCleric 4: Greater Magic Weapon x2, Death Ward, Restoration, Neutralize Poison<br/>\nCleric 5: Improved invisibility x2, True seeing, Spell Resistance<br/>\nCleric 6: Heal x2, Greater Sanctuary<br/>\nCleric 7: Word of Faith x2 (huge AOE Stun for 6 rounds, limited by low caster levels)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>Naked and unbuffed with two normal Kama's</strong><br/>\nHit Points: 330<br/>\nArmor Class: 25<br/>\nSaves: Fortitude 26/ Reflex 22/ Will 26. +4 vs spells to all.\u00a0<br/>\nBAB: 26<br/>\nAttack Bonus: (Kama main Kama offhand) +34/+31/+28/+25/+22/+19/+34/+31<br/>\nDamage: (Kama main, Kama offhand) 1d6 + 7 (Crit 19-20/x2 +1d6 overwhelming critical +devastating critical chance of death) +9d6 sneak, 1d6 + 3 (Crit 19-20/x2 +1d6 overwhelming critical +devastating critical chance of death)\u00a0+9d6 sneak<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Equipped with:\u00a0</strong>Imaskari Kama / Imaskari Kama / Robes of the Shining Hand (+3) / Greater Mask of Persuasion (+2 Charisma) / Nymph Cloak (+3 Charisma) / Gauntlets of Ogre Power (+2 Strength) / Belt of Frost Giant Strength (+4) / Ring of Power / Amulet of Natural Armor (+3) / Boots of Speed (haste)<br/>\n<strong>Buffed with:</strong> Flurry of blows, Protection from Good, Protection from Elements, Endurance, Eagle's Splendor, Owl's Wisdom, Ultravision, Cat's Grace, Darkfire each Kama, Magic Vestment, Death Ward, Greater Magic Weapon each Kama, Bull's Strength, Divine Favor, Improved Invisibility<br/>\n<strong>Fiend buffed:\u00a0</strong>with Bull's Strength and Darkfire<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Main character buffed as described:</strong><br/>\nHit Points: 410<br/>\nArmor Class: 40 (+2 against Good)<br/>\nSaves: Fortitude 31/ Reflex 27/ Will 31. +4 vs spells to all. +2 against good to all.

614.3 damage / round for main character and minion with criticals, overwhelming criticals but without sneak attack </strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>plus one DC 41 Fortitude Save or death for opponent / round on average (could be more or less)</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<em><span style=\"font-size:175%;line-height:normal\">With sneak attack and criticals:</span></em><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>508 - 1154.3 / round for main character, minion with critical, overwhelming criticals and sneak attack</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>plus one DC 41 Fortitude Save or death for opponent / round on average (could be more or less)</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nSo without sneak attacks you do approximately 500 damage / round, and if you have sneak attacks you do about approximately 830 damage / round!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Plus your opponent has to, on average, make a DC 41 fortitude save or die. This could be multiple if you are lucky with critical!!!</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nOf course this means your minion has to be behaving perfectly but your minion does about 80 damage / round which is pretty minimal considering the amount of damage you are doing.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Further comment - you could do even more damage:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I haven\u2019t used the War Domain buff (+3 damage / attack / round plus further bonuses)<br/>\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I haven\u2019t used Aura of Vitality buff (+4 Str / Cons / Dex)<br/>\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I haven\u2019t used Battletide spell (+2 damage / attack / saves)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I could add a further 7 damage / hit, 77 damage / round (including critical) if I cast all those spells plus other bonuses.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the downside of casting them is its short duration and it is annoying to have to recast them all the time so I haven\u2019t used them in the calculation. But there may be situations before very tough fights you do cast these so it is relevant to mention.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>Gameplay notes:</strong><br/>\nThis build has multiple invisibility spells. Against an opponent who is susceptible to sneak attacks this pretty much guarantees 10 sneak attacks on the first round you break invisibility. In addition, you can recast this spell, reposition and attack / kill\u00a0again. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou also have a minion who can draw aggression. You can also retreat from battle with your Tumble ability avoiding attacks of opportunity / use the sanctuary spell, to allow you to get another round of 10 sneak attacks in. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou have the greater invisibility spell, which provides 50% concealment, which is brilliant defensively against everything.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could swap the War Domain with Magic Domain. You would exchange Cat's Grace and Aura of Vitality + War domain Buff, for Mage Armor and Stone Skin spells for slightly better defensive abilities. I think the War Domain is better though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Finally:</strong><br/>\nHope you enjoyed this post! Comments welcome as always. I still can't believe this game is 17 years old and I'm finding new things about it.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd thanks to you guys for keeping the interest in NWN 1 alive, its been a blast so far.\u00a0</div>"

I'd suggest Monk 2 is better than 9 because you get better cleric (ie better GMW or Darkfire) and blackguard abilities<br/>\nAlso I think human would be better than elf (allowing you potentially to reduce INT by 2 if you didnt want all those skill points) and having some strength points even if you go a DEX build is good given you are doing up to 10 attacks / round and the +str damage / attack is obviously great in that situation</div>"

      "content": "<div>I've taken this build through Aielund Saga Act 3 and Act 4 pt 1, 2 and 3. I thought I'd just make some general gameplay comments. I went from lvl 15 to lvl 36 in these 4 modules.<br/>\n<br/>\nAielund is somewhat biased against evil characters (for example, one companion will refuse to join you) but it is still fun especially when talking to Nelise who will tolerate almost anything you do with only very rare exceptions. Having so many companions available to you is great combined with your sneak attack ability. You will want a fighter in your party to draw agro and knock down enemies for you, and anything else on top of that is a bonus. There are also no unique kama weapons (the best I could find was a Kama +7) which is a contrast to the nwn campaign which had 4 unique kamas to choose from.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis build is best played in combat very rogueish, except you are using magic stealth rather than hide and move silently skills. Magic invisibility is probably superior to hide and move silently skills as you can 'hide in plain sight' without having to take a level in shadowdancer prestige class. It is also a total mage or cleric hunter and with invisibility/improved invisibility you can run past mobs to the backlines, cast your divine favour/divine might buffs, cast your fiend or other summon as a distraction, then break invisibility by attack with 3-5 knockdown attempts on that mage, to take out that mage before they can cast anything. If they are\u00a0vulnerable to sneak attack they are usually dead unless they are some super major boss. Then you can keep using sneak attack on remaining enemies until you draw agro, run away, cast invisibility, rinse and repeat. I pretty much used this strategy all game until the end part where I will try to avoid saying any spoilers except pretty much at the end game every monster is immune to knockdown and has true sight which is really painful\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also save low health teammates by asking them to stop attacking, cast invisibility on them then heal them up with your heal skill (or spell, if you have lvl 6 cleric spells).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you run out of invisibility then just stand next to your fighter and minion and play like a rogue even though you can take them on head to head, you are way more efficient if you can use your sneak attacks. Your minion will have a knockdown ability and haste which is pretty swell for you.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nConcentration is valuable to cast invisibility, divine favor, battletide and divine power buffs in the middle of battle, and those few levels of tumble at lvl 2 from monk +whatever dex bonus you have is actually sufficient to avoid about 50%-75% of attacks of opportunity which is great<br/>\n<br/>\nBull's strength, divine favor, battletide, divine power are great to boost your attack rating up so you can land those 10 sneak attacks more often on those difficult to hit bosses and enemies. It's a real pain to watch you throw out 10 hits, and only 2 of them hit, so if you encounter this, back off and cast those buffs and go back in. It's particularly an issue because greater magic weapon is nerfed in Aielund to the extend it is pretty much worthless. Darkfire is useful but also not as strong as in the normal game and the game will not let you cast it on certain weapons that are too strong..<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause your caster level is reasonably lowish (ie cleric 9-13 against lvl 30 monsters), you are very vulnerable to dispel magic abilities. It's always best to get your fighter/paladin to draw attention and the dispel magic then engage. This might mean casting your summon / divine favor / divine might / other buffs while invisible and this is happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nDamage resistant enemies are a pain. Constructs ie golems and the undead are a pain as they are immune to criticals, sneak attack and usually will have reduced damage modifiers. Adding weapon damage to your primary weapon, particularly acid damage, will make Aielund so much easier. Divine might and divine favor (the mod changed the damage type to divine rather than magical) will also help as usually divine damage will bypass these modifiers.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can manage your CONS 8 stat which is a pain, by careful re-rolling, endurance spell and some items. I was running around with 400-450 hp by the end of the game, with my fighter having 550, which isnt too bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also ignore devastating critical as they disabled that feat in the modules, and put the feat points from those abilities into other things such as greater strength, toughness improved knockdown etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will try to minimise spoilers but there is a part of the game where you will need to fight without access to kamas, and your fists are actually more than sufficient when you do 7 attacks with with DM, DF, Bull Strength etc<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thought I'd just share my experience. Invisible blackguard sneaking around with 10 sneak attacks + other buffs is pretty lethal and I just felt like I was a total assassin with amazing combat abilities buffs heals and summons and saves</div>"

Battles would end rapidly in a few rounds regardless of whether you sneak attack or not, and have their strength reduced massively with 6-8 hits. I didnt have to do any of this stealth stuff I had to do in Aielund, which is much more of a challenge.\u00a0The ending boss was slightly more of a challenge but back off and use your heal potions and spells you can cruise through that as well.\u00a0</div>"

I hadn't seen the gloves until your post, and I've loaded up a save game, and they are pretty nice!\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe gloves you reference have +10 AB and 2d12 magic damage which gives an unarmed weapon damage range of 3-18 with two levels of monk (with my build), but 3-32 as a primary class monk (at least lvl 16)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best Kama I could get was an Kama +7 1d6, which i then enchanted with Keen and +2d10 acid which gives you a weapon damage range of 10 to 33 and then other buffs to increase it further<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can't cast Darkfire on your fists which is 1d4-1d6 fire damage depending on your cleric level, so you can get a damage range of 11-39 with a darkfire enchanted Kama<br/>\n<br/>\nSo as a primary monk given the 2d12 magic damage type will bypass a lot of damage reduction, it could be slightly better but if you can enchant the kama appropriately it is still not bad, in fact still quite comparable<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a secondary monk it looks like you can get a bit of damage out of an appropriately enchanted kama and you free up a glove slot for something else<br/>\n<br/>\n\u00a0if you want to go unarmed or single kama with this build you can ditch TWF, Ambidexterity, ITWF for other feats and lower your dex and increase other stats such as strength, cons or charisma. you'd still get 8 attacks with flurry and haste, which will hit more often given you are not dual wielding. I just have a weakness for 10 attacks LUL<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>small edit: the weapon enchantment was +2d10 , not +1d10</strong></div>"

I actually hadn't thought about this in detail even when I was going through HoTU.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour schedule is ok, it gives you access to the level 6 heal spell which is great to keep your companions alive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI feel I've gotten better at building since I wrote my initial post having getting feedback from the experienced hands on the forum.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving played through HoTU I would probably go Cleric 15 Monk 3 Blackguard 10. 6 levels of Blackguard beyond 10 give 2d6 sneak attack epic vrock and one bonus feat. 4 cleric levels and 2 monk level gives you level 7 and 8 spells (Mass Heal! :), a stronger Divine Favor buff and a further tumble dump for +5AC. You could continue pumping blackguard after that. In epic levels your BAB increases the same whether you raise Cleric Monk or Blackguard. If you go Cleric 8 Monk 2 BG 10 pre-epic you get one extra AB compared with Cleric 9 M 1 BG 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 15 is nice for cleric as you maximize Greater Magic Weapon and Divine Favor. Thats 10AB for two spells, if you have mundane equipment. Its great if you do 10 sneak attacks, but even better if all of them hit!!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a vendor who will enchant your weapons for a lot of gold. If you need to prioritise, obviously prioritise your main weapon which will do 6-8 attacks / round (depending if you are flurried and/or hasted) rather than your offhand which will only do 2 attacks per round regardless of flurry or haste<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are a total power gamer, there is also a secret location where you can enchant up to two weapons with the ability to damage your enemy's strength statistic per hit which is crazy strong with this build. Just be sure to maximise your weapon with the above vendor before you take these enchantments because he will refuse to further enchant your weapon as it is already 'too powerful' :)<br/>\n<br/>\nFeats I would remove with a level 28 limitation would be the greater cleave and improved critical (kama) feats, because you aren't going to get near devastating critical and take other feats. Improved critical (Kama) will only increase your total damage output by 5%.<br/>\n<br/>\nGetting extra wis is not wasted as you get extra AC from Monk class and a better Will save<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could probably delay your third level of Monk if you plan to take this character through, say Aielund, where Cleric 15 Monk 3 BG 22 would be perfectly fine. But if you are limited to 28 levels, one extra monk level gives you more than one black guard level (ie BG 10-11 gives far less than M2-3)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis could be a suitable schedule (I've used the CBC spreadsheet to do it quickly):<br/>\n<br/>\nCleric(15), Monk(3), Blackguard(10), Human<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 14 (17)<br/>\nDEX: 14 (15)<br/>\nCON: 8<br/>\nWIS: 14 (18)<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 14<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Cleric(1): Blind Fight, Two-Weapon Fighting, Domain War, Domain Trickery<br/>\n02: Monk(1): {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}<br/>\n03: Cleric(2): Weapon Focus: Kama<br/>\n04: Cleric(3): DEX+1, (DEX=15)<br/>\n05: Cleric(4)<br/>\n06: Cleric(5): Ambidexterity<br/>\n07: Cleric(6)<br/>\n08: Cleric(7): WIS+1, (WIS=15)<br/>\n09: Cleric(8): Power Attack<br/>\n10: Monk(2): {Deflect Arrows} -&gt; if you go Cleric 8 Monk 2 pre epic you get +1AB compared with Cleric 9 Monk 1 pre epic<br/>\n11: Blackguard(1)<br/>\n12: Blackguard(2): STR+1, Knockdown, {Smite Good}, (STR=15)<br/>\n13: Blackguard(3)<br/>\n14: Blackguard(4)<br/>\n15: Blackguard(5): Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br/>\n16: Blackguard(6): STR+1, (STR=16)<br/>\n17: Blackguard(7)<br/>\n18: Blackguard(8): Divine Might<br/>\n19: Blackguard(9)<br/>\n20: Blackguard(10): WIS+1, (WIS=16)<br/>\n21: Cleric(9): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=17)<br/>\n22: Cleric(10)<br/>\n23: Cleric(11)<br/>\n24: Cleric(12): WIS+1, Epic Weapon Focus: Kama, (WIS=18)<br/>\n25: Cleric(13)<br/>\n26: Cleric(14)<br/>\n27: Cleric(15): Epic Prowess<br/>\n28: Monk(3): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 216<br/>\nSkillpoints: 161<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 21/22/16<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Mind Effects: +2<br/>\nBAB: 21<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 28 (melee), 24 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked): 22<br/>\nSpell Casting: Cleric(8)</div>"

The weakness of DP in a minor class cleric is the short duration. Throughout my playthrough I rarely used Divine Power simply because 9-13 rounds is not long before you need to recast the ability with only 9-13 levels of cleric. \u00a0I also didn't take the extend spell feat.\u00a0You already are casting DF and DM regularly and if you have 10 attacks per round, you want to be hitting as much as possible, not spending most of that time casting buffs. Its obviously different if you have 37 levels of cleric and extend spell. Theres quite a few Cleric / Monk builds on the ECB database (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/buildsearch/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/buil ... index.html</a>) if you want to go down this path. Don't get me wrong, primary cleric is superstrong<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also probably ditch Blackguard if you focus on DP and take Str 8. This is because\u00a0you will miss out on one of the strengths of a Cleric / BG combo which is stackable Bull's Strength which provides up to 10 strength. There is a +12 stat cap you will reach with Divine Power very easily, even without items or the stackable Bull's Strength. You will also not have enough strength for Power attack (and hence Divine Might). Without Divine Might you may be tempted to 'dump' charisma as well as strength, which would lead to a negative value to saves from Dark Blessing. (unlike Divine Grace, Dark Blessing can make your saves worse with a negative Charisma modifier).\u00a0If you want some sneak attacks (who wouldn't if you do 10 attacks!) 1 level of rogue is nice for a further tumble dump, UMD? If you want to go all in on Sneak and just use cleric for buffs, you could check out Mick Dagger's (up to 10 attack build with DP) Cleric / Monk / Assassin build around Divine Power (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build264737.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/buil ... 64737.html</a>) although level 8 cleric is not a great number to stop leveling cleric, because level 9 cleric gives you Divine Favor +3 rather than +2, I think Mick was trying to fit in as much Assassin power as possible + 10 APR into the build.</div>"
