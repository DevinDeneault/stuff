Different, yes. So much depends on how you like to play - or whether you want to try a different playstyle. There is, after all, no \"perfect\" build - and it would probably be very boring if there was.<br/>\n<br/>\nCertainly, for offense, a strength-based Fighter/WM is great, but saves and AC will likely suck (particularly Will, which can be catastrophic for mundane melee builds), and you won't have many skills to use. Plus, of course, qualifying for WM eats up a lot of (largely useless) feats, so you become more restricted in your options. If going for a Fighter/WM you'll certainly want a third class to help with these issues, such as - but not restricted to - Rogue, Bard or Monk. That will, of course, mean the loss of at least 1AB, but it's worth it not to be turned into a messy splat on the floor on a regular basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a great straight-up meleer, also have a look at Mick's Brawler Champion in the 20s section - I've enjoyed that many times, along with its more exalted Epic cousin. Then there's Valerfor's Peck'n Decker, which is a Fighter 10/ WM 7/ Monk 3.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Crits are great if it's easy to hit enemies, so it probably works from that side. It's less good on defence though and you don't have as many spare Feats to help, because WM requires so many. Further, you need at least 13 in Dex &amp; Int (neither of which you really need), so you necessarily have less to put in Con (I assume maxing Str whatever).<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Fighter/Bard/PM you have the AC, but you don't have the Str, plus PM is low BAB. We don't want a caster here and in any case you would have to juggle Armor, due to ASF. I don't think it really works with the level restriction.<br/>\n<br/>\nOddly enough the topic of one of these builds on a low magic worlds was raised in <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/dragon-spawn-fighter-6-bard-4-red-dragon-disciple--t515343.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dragon-spawn-fighter-6-bard-4-red-drago ... 15343.html</a>\u00a0way back in 2011.

It's also more tactical than KD, so you need to decide whether you want to slow them down (leg) or knacker their use of weaponry (arm).<br/>\n<br/>\nii) Unless you're going big in Heal, in my opinion that's the least useful (assuming you're not going for a Cleric/Pally build). If possible, you always want a detection skill (Spot or Listen), and if you ain't got a handy Rogue nearby, not being blown to pieces on a frequent basis is a helpful thing.<br/>\n<br/>\niii) Nothing wrong with Dodge, but unless it's a necessary qualification for something else, you might want to think if anything else would be better (after all, it's +1AC only against the foe you're facing, so a bit rubbish with mobs).<br/>\n<br/>\niv) Roleplay UMD? It's a phenomenal skill to have, if you can get it. Use of scrolls, wands, and otherwise unavailable gear (assuming no clashes with specific items) - what's not to like? Rogues wearing Monk boots and robes while chucking spells around confuses the crap out of people!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

But, if you split Rogue to levels 2 or 7/ 7 or 12/ and17 you'll get your Tumbles sorted more efficiently. And you may have said before why you're going for Bastard Sword, but I can't remember. If you bin it for Scimitar your chance of a crit soars and you get another feat (assuming you want to continue as human). I'm afraid I don't see the point of Great Cleave unless you can get to Dev Crit - it can be really annoying otherwise. Called Shot is an interesting take - I may be more tempted by Disarm - but that would only really work well with a 2-handed weapon. Fortunately, if you skip exotic weapons and Great Cleave, you can get WF and WS in Heavy Flail or Greatsword.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe taunt issue is an interesting one: take the skill and you can do it - take concentration and others won't be able to taunt you.

You have improved expertise and since you do, I would skip it all together. Called Shot really shines early on and mostly with a ranged character. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the topic of taunt, I would take it, but know this. Many mobs have concentration. If you ever want to create a taunt version of this kind of build, I would go for ftr6/bard4/cot10. You would lose sneak atks against knocked and flanked targets, but you would also gain more will saves and the ability to take bard at the last level of level 20.<br/>\n<br/>\nDepending on how much you need saves on your character, I would take Luck of heroes and Strong soul at level 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of feats, I would optimize as well for stronger early game power.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Fighter(1): LoH, S.Soul, Power Attack, <br/>\n02: Fighter(2): Cleave<br/>\n03: Fighter(3): WF: +<br/>\n04: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: +<br/>\n05: Bard(1)<br/>\n06: Bard(2): knockdown<br/>\n07: Bard(3): (Tumble, taunt 10)<br/>\n08: CoT(1)<br/>\n09: CoT(2): Improved Knockdown, Improved Critical: Bastard Sword<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just a suggestion of course, but the main theme for any melee build in my mind early on is getting cleave, ikd and imp crit as soon as I can. I would follow the same logic on the rogue version of the build as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general I believe your build comes down to the first 2 levels. If you can quite easily get to level 2, the I would take the LoH and S.soul all day. If not, I would keep LoH and take pwr atk and cleave level 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast thing is I would also pick scimitar 100%. You will see the difference as your AB gets better. In the meantime, use whatever you find. Also the need for a blunt weapon should be for undeads of course, yet I dont see the need to specialize in it. The dmg lost from a slash/pierce weapon against undead, is clearly covered by blunt dmg alone.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

UMD = AC &gt; AB = Saves &gt; Damage &gt; HP<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Feats </strong>(I have 17 available\u00a0feats and this 19 seem good options) (Maybe i am missed a useful feats! For example\u00a0I am not counting WS:Heavy Flail)<br/>\n<br/>\nMust have: WF:Scimitar, WS:Scimitar, IC:Scimitar, KD, IKD, Expertise, Power attack, Cleave, Blind Fight<br/>\nProbably should have: WF:Heavy Flail, Disarm, IDisarm<br/>\nTempted to have: Called Shot, IExpertise, Dodge.\u00a0<br/>\nUseful to have: Toughness, Luck of Heroes, Iron Will, S. Soul<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Skills</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nConcentration: Incredibly strong but very few monsters taunt in this server.<br/>\nDiscipline: Must have!<br/>\nHeal: Not needed?<br/>\nSpellcraft: Must have (Should be a multiple of 5 after adding the INT modifier)<br/>\nSpot: Must have?<br/>\nTaunt: Not worthwhile to crossclassing it?<br/>\nTumble: Must have (Should be a rank multiple of 5)\u00a0<br/>\nUMD: Must have! (Is it good enough with 20 pre epic or should aim for 23?)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
