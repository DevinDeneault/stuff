The more a spell is used, the more is placed into the centre of the bar.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow on to you ;)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">This is a good discussion.<br/>\nWe probably do many things intuitively and right, but even so I believe there are things we can learn from each other.<br/>\nFor me the normal F-keys (no shift/ctrl) have the functions I use most often and that need to be readily available. That's not different from the rest of you.<br/>\nNumber 2 for me is the ctrl-F row. I just find it easier to hit the ctrl key than the shift key when in the middle of something.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I put on the differeent F-keys depends of course on what kind of character I play. A fighter type will have the most important combat feats on F1 - F4. A scout will have Detect Mode there (unless an elf). A stealth character will have stealth on F1. A HIPS'er will also have the attack icon on F2, not because I attack from the function keys, but because pressing it in combat disengages from combat and enables stealth immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith trappers I sometimes put the crafting symbol on F6. When pressing that I come to the crafting dialogue. Craft trap is the bottom dialogue choice, often number 6 (don't have to move the finger far from F6). I use this to speed up crafting traps. If electric traps is option 2 in the next dialogue, and I want to craft average traps (option 2 on the next dialogue again), I can then craft an average electric trap in an instant by pressing F6, 6 with my right hand followed by 2, 2 with my left in quick succession.<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually quick-slot some healing- and clarity potions on F10 - 12. For multiplayer it can be a good idea to have healing kits there as well so you can help fallen comrades that are about to bleed to death.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith casters I put the most important combat spells on the normal F-keys. I put long term buffs on the shift-F row. There are too few quickslots to cover everything when I play casters. Sorcerers want \"every\" spell available with different meta magic.\u00a0 Characters with more caster classes, like the \"Spirit and Steel\" have just too many spells available to cover with quickslots. So speeding up the radial menu with the keypad can be necessary sometimes.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Thus my love for innate feats/actions rather than ones I have to actively choose. I therefore tend to use only one line of quickslots (and not playing casters really helps with this), so it's mostly knockdown and stealth that dwell there, the rest being pots, kits, a ranged weapon (if a melee build), and a variety of belts/ boots/ weapons/ etc, depending where I find myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, everyone else comes up with really good advice! A discussion well-raised, Aquarius! (Even if it shows my own troglodyte tendencies yet again.)<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
