      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi Regsa! To a certain extent it will depend on what you want from the build. Good or evil might be important for you, which could restrict your options. A nice straightforward one would be to take 21 levels of Bard (for an earlier Lasting Inspiration while keeping a late skills dump) and 4 of Fighter for WS. Or 4 or 5 levels of RDD for a nice boost to strength and AC. The Fighter option would mean - even with human - an xp penalty. Have you considered a half-orc Bardbarian (or Barbardian) with the RDD thrown in (you could always lose exotic weapon proficiency)?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want a melee-merchant - and this is only me - I might think about only taking 4 levels of Bard pre-epic, so you'd have 29 BAB by level 40, but it's only one more, and you'd need to either increase your levels of Barbarian or take the 3rd class pre-epic.<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I right in assuming your general feats in epic levels that you haven't specified will be taken by Great Strengths? Epic Prowess is the only other one that leaps out at me.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a couple of things to think about before someone who knows these classes better rocks up...<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I have played a ranged party bard before going lots of bard levels early on and a few AA, but i really lack a damage output and HP, thats why i though of barbarian, and i like the Terrifying Rage feat, and pure barbarian isnt relly worth it i think. So as i like the bard song and what it brings i thought that i if i combined the 2 things it could work wonders.<br/>\n<br/>\nas for Epic feats yes i think they will go to Great Strengths, cant really see what else to pick, maybe\u00a0Epic Prowess if i end up on an odd strength stat. <br/>\nThe half-orc Barbardian with RRD just doesnt really apply to meat, i would love my character to maybe gain a bit more in the later levels than just more melee strength<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The downside is that everything comes late I'm afraid so it's not that great for hard-leveling PW's.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
