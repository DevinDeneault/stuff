It adds extra bonuses as well which I won't go into detail right now to avoid complicating things.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI've chosen to put some skill points into discipline to avoid you getting knocked down, tumble to increase your defenses with +4 to AC, heal so you can use heal kits on yourself or others, and persuade because there are lots of persuade dialogue options in the OC and it is more enjoyable to pass them<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are struggling remember to put healing potions in the quickbar, and try not to take on too many enemies at once. Your henchman generally are not good at this and will charge into mobs of enemies madly. You will have to issue a 'stand your ground' command to make sure they stay still so you can lure a small number of enemies at a time. Then you will need to issue a 'attack nearest' when your enemies come near enough. To do this, right click your henchman, then select stand your ground<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/201912/10759084_0b9ae63dd1139cfbf33ede80eb5b7422_t.jpg\"/><br/>\n<br/>\nthen when the enemies come near enough, right click your henchman and click 'attack nearest'<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/201912/10759084_9182aab3dd3be8b0fc80c5b10e51a373_t.jpg\"/><br/>\n<br/>\nInitially I would suggest just luring them by them seeing you, but once you are more confident in the game you can switch between a ranged weapon (like a shortbow in this example), shoot an enemy, then unequip this, run back then punch em with your fists.<br/>\n<br/>\nThroughout the tutorial you will need to play as a rogue, this is largely so you get a lot of extra skill points at level 1, then after you get level 2 you can start to play like a monk and punch em, albeit with extra damage from sneak attack!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of gear, when you do the tutorial equip studded leather and a shortsword at level 1, then when you get to level 2, equip some clothing / monk robes and just use your fists to attack. Your monk abilities will be disabled if you use any armor other than robes/clothing, and much of your monk combat power will be disabled if you use any weapon other than your fists or a Kama<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Monk(16), Rogue(4), Human\n\nDEX: 14\nWIS: 12\nCHA: 8\nHuman: (Quick to Master)\n02: Monk(1): {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}\n04: Monk(3): CON+1, (CON=16)\n06: Monk(5): Blind Fight\n08: Rogue(2): STR+1, (STR=17)\n10: Monk(8)\n12: Monk(10): STR+1, Improved Critical: Unarmed, (STR=18)\n14: Monk(11)\n16: Monk(13): STR+1, (STR=19)\n18: Monk(15): Resist Energy: Acid\n20: Rogue(4): STR+1, (STR=20)\nHitpoints: 232\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 15/15/17\nBAB: 15\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 20/20\nAlignment Changes: 0\nDiscipline 22(27), Heal 8(9), Hide 23(25), Move Silently 23(25), Persuade 23(22), Tumble 23(25), UMD 21(20)\n\n02: Discipline(5), Heal(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Persuade(1), Tumble(1), Save(7),\u00a0\n04: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Persuade(1), Tumble(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n06: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Persuade(1), Tumble(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n08: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Persuade(1), Tumble(1), UMD(7), Save(2),\u00a0\n10: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Persuade(1), Tumble(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n12: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Persuade(1), Tumble(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n14: Discipline(2), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Persuade(1), Tumble(1),\u00a0\n16: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Persuade(1), Tumble(1),\u00a0\n18: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Persuade(1), Tumble(1),\u00a0\n20: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Persuade(1), Tumble(1), UMD(5),\u00a0</details>\nIf there are any other troubles you're having with the OC feel free to post it up<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this is helpful</div>"
