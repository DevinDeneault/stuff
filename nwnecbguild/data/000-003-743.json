I might still go down that path, however I'm looking to build something a little more versatile. I'm looking for help to build something decent. I have found going Druid/Monk/Shifter works fantastic for AC, but my AB is extremely poor. What can I do to raise this? Do I have to sacrifice Monk to get it low 40s?\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, as before I'm restricted to 30 level<br/>\nI must take 3 levels in the same class together before I can start mixing (so if I'm 5 druid, I need to do at least 3 shifter before I can do something else)\u00a0<br/>\nIt is a low magic world.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I won't be able to calculate the AB/AC values without knowing the above information though.</div></blockquote>\nVery detailed reply. I'll answer all as best I can:<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want a detailed build we would need a lot more information about Arelith -\u00a0<br/>\nShifters are unchanged, However\u00a0Dragon shape is off the table as only druids get it on the cheap, shifters get shafted. Also, Monk AC/UBAB don't translate to dragon shape anymore. It changes the main hand to a magic staff (not quarter staff)<br/>\nDruids are basically the same.\u00a0<br/>\nMonks are a little different, the things that are relavent to a 6 level dip are:\u00a0\n<ul>\n<li>Monk Weapon Proficiency: This feat allows effective use of club, dagger, handaxe, light crossbow, heavy crossbow, nagitata, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, kama, katana, sling and wakizashi.</li>\n<li>Lvl 2: gains feat - Weapon Focus: Unarmed (free)</li>\n</ul>\n\nWhat sort of AB/AC values are you looking for - I'm Flexible on AC. 45-55 range seems easy with monk. AB however I can't seems to get over mid 30s at best. i'd like low 40s<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat item level is available on Arelith? +3 AB / +3 AC? Is it possible to get +12 abilities via gear - You can get +12 in 2-3 stats via items and buffs. You can generally dedicate to +12 in one stat easy if you wanted too.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAre the ability changes from subraces and gifts removed when shifted?\u00a0 - Gifts I can get +2 hard bonus in 2 stats that will count towards feats. Normal rules around shifting from normal NWN. So if it removes it there, it will remove it here, and vise versa.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAre there any changes to shifted forms or are they all vanilla shapes - All are normal for shifter<br/>\n<br/>\nIs item merging changed from vanilla NWN or is it the same - No changes here<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes Monk WIS AC apply while shifted - Yes, but not for dragon shape<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a side note:\u00a0Dru25/Monk5 dragon is possible with 25 wisdom and no feat cost (you can get it free). However the monk UBAB and Wis AC will not translate to dragon shape. Might work better with 4 fighter for that guy.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I went for a human with both CON and WIS gifts, if that's not what you want it's fairly easy to change. If there are subraces that increase CON or WIS then they might be worth considering.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just a rough draft so I haven't done the skill progression. You have enough skill points to max Discipline, Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Spellcraft, and Tumble. The rest will go to skills that require training and either Animal Empathy, Concentration, or Lore.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want IExp then the only spare pre-epic feat is Toughness. Maybe swap it for Knockdown since the build only gets IKD at level 30.<br/>\nIf you want a spare epic feat then you can either drop Great Wisdom or Outsider Shape. If I was to change anything then I would switch Outsider Shape for ESF: Discipline since none of the shapes are very impressive offensively. Rakshasa magic immunity might be useful for PvM tanking but the Ice Storm is very weak (4d6 Cold + 3d6 Bludgeoning). However since your AC will probably be higher than your Discipline it might be better to stick with the current feats and leave ESF: Discipline. Epic Fortitude is another useful epic feat but without experience on the server I don't know if you will need it or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nDue to how item merging works it doesn't matter which slot has AC since it all merges to Deflection. Only the highest AC value from all of your slots matter, so this can free up some space when choosing your equipment.<br/>\nA major problem with item merging is that ability enhancements don't stack, it will be very hard to get +11 DEX and +12 WIS with vanilla item merging. I suggest looking for a weapon with ability enhancements, since your shortsword will have +6 EB regardless of the base weapon. A +3 DEX armor and a +3 DEX weapon will stack for +6 DEX when shifted, but a +3 DEX armor and a +3 DEX shield won't stack. Buffs like Cat's Grace will work normally, so either carry a lot of potions or try to party with a friendly caster.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nClass: Druid 7 / Shifter 17 / Monk 6<br/>\nRace: Human<br/>\nAlignment: Lawful Neutral<br/>\nGifts: +2 CON, +2 WIS<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 12<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 16 (18)<br/>\nWIS: 16 (26)<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Druid(1): Expertise, Improved Expertise, (CON=18), (WIS=18)<br/>\n02: Druid(2)<br/>\n03: Druid(3): Alertness<br/>\n04: Druid(4): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br/>\n05: Druid(5)<br/>\n06: Shifter(1): Blind Fight<br/>\n07: Shifter(2)<br/>\n08: Shifter(3): WIS+1, (WIS=20)<br/>\n09: Shifter(4): Toughness<br/>\n10: Shifter(5)<br/>\n11: Monk(1)<br/>\n12: Monk(2): WIS+1, Weapon Proficiency Martial, (WIS=21)<br/>\n13: Monk(3)<br/>\n14: Shifter(6)<br/>\n15: Shifter(7): Weapon Focus: Shortsword<br/>\n16: Shifter(8): WIS+1, (WIS=22)<br/>\n17: Shifter(9)<br/>\n18: Shifter(10): Improved Critical: Shortsword<br/>\n19: Druid(6)<br/>\n20: Monk(4): WIS+1, (WIS=23)<br/>\n21: Shifter(11): Undead Shape<br/>\n22: Shifter(12)<br/>\n23: Shifter(13): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=24)<br/>\n24: Shifter(14): WIS+1, Armor Skin, (WIS=25)<br/>\n25: Shifter(15)<br/>\n26: Shifter(16): Outsider Shape<br/>\n27: Shifter(17): Epic Weapon Focus: Shortsword<br/>\n28: Monk(5): WIS+1, (WIS=26)<br/>\n29: Druid(7)<br/>\n30: Monk(6): Epic Prowess<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nNaked Stats<br/>\nHitpoints: 390<br/>\nSkillpoints: 231<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 25/25/17<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Mind Effects: +2, Fear: +2<br/>\nBAB: 19<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 24 (melee), 19 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 20/20<br/>\nSpell Casting: Druid(4)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nBuffed Stats (While shifted, assuming that you have +11 DEX, +12 WIS, and one +3 AC item)<br/>\nAB: 19 (BAB) + 13 (DEX) + 4 (Feats) + 6 (EB Bonus) + 1 (Size) = +43<br/>\nAC: 10 (Base) + 13 (DEX) + 14 (WIS) + 6 (Tumble) + 2 (Feats) +1 (Monk Bonus) + 3 (AC Bonus) + 13 (Shape Dodge Bonus) + 4 (Barkskin) + 1 (Size) = 67<br/>\nHP: 240 (Base) + 120 (CON) + 30 (Toughness) = 390<br/>\nFortitude: 21 (Base) + 4 (CON) = 25<br/>\nReflex: 18 (Base) + 13 (DEX) = 31<br/>\nWill: 17 (Base) + 14 (WIS) = 31<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The build should do very well at PvM tanking in a party. Gargoyle, Risen Lord, and Rakshasa all have great defences, and combined with IExp you should be able to AC tank a lot of monsters while the rest of your party kills them. Vampire can work against tough enemies since the level drain is tough to remove, however your fights will last a very long time while waiting for them to roll badly.
