If you do have the option of getting a simple +2 Charisma item though, then you can move them earlier to the 17th &amp; 27th levels accordingly.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n COMBAT OPTIONS:\u00a0<br/>\n A dual-Wielder will always get the most out of his abilities when performing full attacks but you do have the option to use Knockdown against Mages &amp; Rogues in order to disrupt their attacks.\u00a0Whirlwind attack is useful when facing foes that hide with sanctuary or kobold commando's for example (HiPS) for you will be able to hurt them even if they are under these conditions.\u00a0Don't forget that you have also Expertise, activate the feat in tough fights in order to get a significant boost in your armour class, you should still be able to hit your opponennts while having that feat active.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><span style=\"color:#000000\">edit: per Hip 20160530 (corrections/additions of missing info, in</span></em><span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong> red</strong></span><em><span style=\"color:#000000\">)</span></em></div>"

Dunno w/o checking.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyhoo... not to be a royal PITA (though it is a birthright my father would attest to if he were still alive), but shouldn't recommendations about Level 40 epic builds go in either Unfinalized or the Level 40 section? \u00a0I mean there is some intrinsic organization implied with all these subforums and it sort of derails Valerfor's original concept, no? \u00a0I suspect campgod was really expecting to see a discrete Level 40 version posted elsewhere (perhaps by Valerfor since it would be a variant of sorts on this theme). \u00a0That would be a more logical residence IMO.</div>"

I guess that means that you would be stuck with 3 Epic Toughness feats.<br/>\n<br/>\n I was leaving it for Valerfor to make and post the actual level 40 build in the correct subforum because it is his build that is being expanded, and it would presumptuous of me to post an expanded version myself, but I didn't want campgod's question to go unanswered, so I made suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\n Because you already have Improved Crit., you would need 5 feats to get Dev. Crit.: Power\u00a0 Attack, Cleave, Great Cleave, Overwhelming Crit., and Dev. Crit. If you made all ten additional levels Fighter, you could get those feats, but you wouldn't get the +3 AB from 9 WM levels, nor an additional Bard skill dump. Another alternative would be to take 2 Fighter, 2 Bard, and 6 WM, and sacrifice 2 Great Strength feats to get Dev. Crit.</div>",

Simply change the split to (fighter 10/ bard 4/ wm 16) taking the three first levels pre-epic and the last one at your 27th level. You will have the same number of epic feats but one pre-epic feat less so you must cut something (easiest is the exotic weapons proficiency) and you are set. The best place to take those three bard levels would be right after your 10th wm one, meaning you take 7 fighter levels then all ten of your wm levels then your three mandatory bard levels then progress normally from there.</div>"
