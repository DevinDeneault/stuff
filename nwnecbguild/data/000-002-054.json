An Assassin or HS AA opens marvellous opportunities, for example...<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever (and you knew there'd be a however), and others may well have different views, we're still supposed to focus on vanilla NwN here, so I can't buy into it as a norm. But (please note the lack of a 'however') if requests are made for such a build, that could be fun. Just not a Full Epic forum one. At least for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, and this isn't me just pissing on your strawberries, because I genuinely see it as a great implementation.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

      "content": "<div>I like the idea of spellbooks for these classes.<br/>\nIf nothing else, we must follow up on how the new hak works and see how popular it becomes.<br/>\nIf the hak replaces the spell-like abilities, we must know if the stacking of the ability buffing spells such as BG Bull's, HS Cat's and Eagle's is out or if it's still there.<br/>\nThe ability stat for casting also becomes an issue now for low wisdom BGs. Assassins normally have a high intelligence while HSs may or may not have a high charisma.<br/>\nIt is a good question if the Assassin and HS classes now are programmed to count as a arcane casters. That could indeed open up a whole new avenue of AA and PM builds. As for RDD, I assume that you still need a class associated with Dragon blood, such as Bard and Sorcerer.</div>",

      "content": "<div>The Hak does not replace the spell like abilities (so that it does not break backwards compatibility) but does make them \"non-operative\" - meaning that the new spellbooks take precedence.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also made a mistake regarding Assassin and RDD - since Assassins have to memorize spells like Wizards, they are not a \"spontaneous spellcaster\" and therefore do not have the requirements for RDD (sorc and bard).<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also like to point out that this Hak utilizes normal, ingame menus, etc - meaning it does not need any other support here.\u00a0 In other words, it is using vanilla assets. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what is exciting imo.\u00a0 It actually is inline with the \"vanilla assets only\" rule.</div>"
