      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">I'm kicking this one off on a long in-drawn breath. Oddly enough, I've had some time on my hands lately, and my bloody stupid brain kept going back to my somewhat shambolic attempt at constructing the beloved Drow Cleric, Viconia DeVir (of Baldur's Gate renown). Here's the full sorry tale... <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/viewtopic.php?p=12165#p12165\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Viconia</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI think I let her down and went for softer options than I should have done. She deserves better, and hopefully the Guild can help me with that. This time I'm going full-blown caster Cleric with buckets of offensive spells, and maybe a smattering of Zen Archery. If there's any second/third class involved, I'm not having any xp penalty (it's one of my unwritten rules), so they'd have to be either prestige classes or Wizard. My current thinking is to only bolt a few Assassin levels on for the skills (like Tumble and UMD) and a bit of Sneak Attack, but am amenable to other suggestions, although she will be Evil this time - or indeed going full Cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, you all know Stag doesn't do casters, so I am going to need nursing through all this malarkey, but I do want to get her right. I put my faith in you good people...<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for helping me remedy a grievous mistake.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">It looks like <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://baldursgate.fandom.com/wiki/Viconia_DeVir\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Viconia</a>\u00a0is a dex / wis neutral evil drow Cleric\u00a0<br/>\nIn terms of second classes, assassin is a great idea and fits with lore, adds some power with skills and uncanny dodge (2+) to protect dex AC in some awesome drow scale mail perhaps, or even cleric robes. Sneak damage is great, which when added to darkfire, GMW +5, divine favor and str damage from divine power should help.<br/>\n<br/>\nRE third class for Viconia. Shadowdancer looks like the best of the bunch for the third class for HiPS,\u00a0 would require you to take dodge and mobility. Wizard 1 might be interesting for the ability to scribe scrolls, although in single player this is not attractive due to the exp costs. I wouldn't choose Blackguard due to the 13 strength + power attack/cleave requirement, although that could be interesting.<br/>\nI like a Cleric 32 / Assassin 7 / SD 1 idea perhaps, Cleric 29 / Assassin 9 / SD 2 gets evasion, uncanny dodge, 4d6 sneak, HiPS, additional improved invisibility / day, 3 epic cleric bonus feats.\u00a0<br/>\nFor two classes maybe Cleric 35 / Assassin 5, Cleric 32 / Assassin 8, Cleric 29 / Assassin 11 depending on the number of skill dumps you want and how much sneak you want with only two classes.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the primary stat it sounds like Wisdom is the choice. Dex you can put to 16 or 18 perhaps, Int 14 to 16 for skill points. Str / Cha could be 10 perhaps.\u00a0<br/>\nThen domains should be decided on. Here's a table from the Wiki which helps. I think Trickery fits well for her. There is one other domain to choose. Travel makes sense so you can cast the Web spell (she is a drow) as well as (extended) haste :). Evil sounds cool. Death as well. Animal is always good for empowered summons + cats. War as well.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary><table class=\"post_content_table\"><tbody><tr><td>Cleric domain</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>air</td>\n<td>turn\u00a0elementals</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>call lightning</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>chain lightning</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>animal</td>\n<td>stronger summon I-VIII</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>cat's grace</td>\n<td>true seeing</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>polymorph self</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>death</td>\n<td>negative plane avatar</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>phantasmal killer</td>\n<td>enervation</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>destruction</td>\n<td>turn\u00a0constructs</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>stinking cloud</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>acid fog</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>earth</td>\n<td>turn\u00a0elementals</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>stoneskin</td>\n<td>energy buffer</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>evil</td>\n<td>turn\u00a0outsiders</td>\n<td>negative energy ray</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>negative energy burst</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>enervation</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>fire</td>\n<td>turn\u00a0elementals</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>wall of fire</td>\n<td>energy buffer</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>good</td>\n<td>turn\u00a0outsiders</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>stoneskin</td>\n<td>lesser planar binding</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>healing</td>\n<td>empowered\u00a0healing</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>cure serious wounds</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>heal</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>knowledge</td>\n<td>more domain spells</td>\n<td>identify</td>\n<td>knock</td>\n<td>clairaudience/<br/>\nclairvoyance</td>\n<td>true seeing</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>legend lore</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>magic</td>\n<td>more domain spells</td>\n<td>mage armor</td>\n<td>Melf's acid arrow</td>\n<td>negative energy burst</td>\n<td>stoneskin</td>\n<td>ice storm</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>plant</td>\n<td>turn\u00a0vermin</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>barkskin</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>creeping doom</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>protection</td>\n<td>divine protection</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>minor globe of invulnerability</td>\n<td>energy buffer</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>strength</td>\n<td>divine strength</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>divine power</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>stoneskin</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>sun</td>\n<td>exceptional turning</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>searing light</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>sunbeam</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>travel</td>\n<td>more domain spells</td>\n<td>entangle</td>\n<td>web</td>\n<td>freedom of movement</td>\n<td>slow</td>\n<td>haste</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>trickery</td>\n<td>divine trickery</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>invisibility</td>\n<td>invisibility sphere</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>improved invisibility</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>war</td>\n<td>battle mastery</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>cat's grace</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>aura of vitality</td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>water</td>\n<td>turn\u00a0elementals</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>poison</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>ice storm</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table></details>\n\nThat sounds like a bit to think about already, hope that helps so far.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Many thanks, Orion.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne particularly annoying thing with building Viconia is that as a Drow she's supposed to have innate spell resistance (65% in BG2, iirc), which would seem to point her towards a heavy investment in Monk, but I don't the levels to spare, given that she's also the strongest caster Cleric in the game. A level or 2 in SD sounds quite appropriate, given that Shar is goddess of night and loss (she was expelled from Lolth's service and adopted by Shar), so there's a certain appeal to the Trickery domain as well - or would that be over-egging things with HiPS as well? Then there's the issue of feats. If I go SD I'll need 2 of my 7 pre-epics to qualify for the class, which doesn't give much wiggle-room assuming I take Zen Archery, Extend, Empower, and at least one of Still and Silent.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's where I really start getting frazzled by the class: which domains to take? In Vicky's case, Death, Destruction, Evil, Strength, Travel, Trickery, Strength, and War all seem fitting, so how to discriminate?<br/>\n<br/>\nBut hey-ho, I've set my feet on this road to hell now, best just keep going...<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I wouldn't choose Evil for example I don't want to use my spell slots for negative energy burst for example, and turning outsiders doesn't quite fit in my mind etc etc it doesn't seem fun to me but maybe thats just me<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Would I be missing out on too much if I took (in no particular order) Zen Archery, Extend, Empower, Silent or Still, Spell Focus and its big brother? That would leave one left for either Blind Fight or a Weapon Focus (could be either crossbow as Cleric, or longbow as Elf). And if I do go down the SF route, it's a question of which bloody school? My first temptations are Evocation or Necromancy.<br/>\n<br/>\nTold you I'd need some nursing in this, sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Oh, and I also forgot about Max Spell.

I just thought it was about time you had something to shoot at. Oh, and I haven't made elven adjustments as yet, please forgive me. Thus...<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT: </strong>Included elven adjustments and accommodated Valerfor's suggested changes (as at 16/07/20)</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Viconia DeVir</strong><br/>\nCleric 38/ Assassin 2<br/>\nElf (Drow): any evil (NE for RP purposes)<br/>\n1-40 PvM (<em>untested - surprise, surprise</em>)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Stats</strong><br/>\nSTR 10 (<em>still makes me twitchy</em>)<br/>\nDEX 12<br/>\nCON 10<br/>\nWIS 18 (38)<br/>\nINT 14<br/>\nCHA 8<br/>\n<br/>\nHit Points: 304<br/>\nAC: (naked) 17 (<em>haven't worked out what she could carry in terms of armour yet, so that's it for now</em>)<br/>\nSaves: Fort 22, Will 36, Reflex 17.

However, I do wonder about the merits of taking any level of Assassin (and I started off with 5). Essentially, it brings +4 AC, 1d6 DA, Use Poison, UDI, Ghostly Visage, and Poison Save +1. And it stops me from maxing my Heal skill, so I'm a bit wobbly about it. I'm also somewhat \"er...?\" about taking the few combat feats I do. Are they worth the investment? Also, this Domain malarkey remains a pita. I've had several different recommendations, all of which I'm sure have merit, but I need some proper guidance, people! (And I'm not talking about playing in a \"domain-restrictive\" environment, btw).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, please give her a look and let me know what you think.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
