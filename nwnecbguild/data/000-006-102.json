      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hail, Mighty ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a NWN interpretation of the Baldur's Gate NPC Mazzy Fentan. The Paladin who couldn't be a Paladin because in BG, only Humans could. In the game, she was a Fighter, but also a Champion of Arvoreen, defender of the good and righteous. So we know that she's going to be a Fighter / CoT (where you read Champion of Arvoreen, in-game it's Champion of Torm, because apparently, according to Neverwinter Nights, only Torm deserves champions LOL). So it was a matter of deciding a third class. Being a very high-dex toon, it'd be a shame not to get Epic Dodge, so I decided I'd go for Rogue, as I really don't see her as a Shadowdancer.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Fighter and CoT as the core of the build, she has a LOT of bonus feats, but she has need of every feat in there, because she specializes in both her Shortsword of Arvoreen and her Shortbow of Arvoreen. She has EWF and EWS in both, and then the combat feats that suit both melee and ranged combat styles (Expertise, KD, IKD for melee, and Called Shot, Rapid Shot and Point Blank Shot for ranged) . She's quite versatile, and can be played as a competent tank with high AB, high AC, Expertise, Epic Dodge, but being a Halfling means she won't successfully KD as many enemies as a Medium creature would. That means she might get attacked more often than other tanks. If you want her to snipe at enemies from afar, she can do that too, although in terms of order of feats, I chose to take the Shortsword feats first. If you want her to snipe more than fight in close quarters, you should probably swap the feats around.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one thing that I really don't see her doing, personality-wise, is setting traps, as she followed a very strict moral code. But I may have powerbuilt her a bit too much, and given her all the trap goodies she could want, LOL. Sometimes I just can't help myself hee hee. So, there are two ways you can deal with it. The first one would be to rationalize it that just because she CAN do something, doesn't mean she WILL do it. Then, she could basically have learned this stuff to be prepared to fight against evildoers who use such tactics. Or, if you're more hardcore about RPing her \"properly\", just tweak the build and invest the points on something else. I personally don't RP much, and I wanted this build to be powerbuilt enough to be effective, but tweakable to be RP-able, so as to try to cater to both worlds.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope you like her!<br/>\n<br/>\nLadies and Gentlemen, please welcome Mazzy Fentan!!<br/>\n<br/>\nFighter(14), Rogue(16), Champion of Arvoreen(10), Halfling<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 14<br/>\nDEX: 18 (34)<br/>\nCON:
