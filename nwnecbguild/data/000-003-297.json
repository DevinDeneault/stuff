      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hei, gang!<br/>\n<br/>\n I'd like to have a couple of dwarf brothers on WoG; one is a greataxe, barbarian-ish, brute kinda guy who loves to leap into battle without regard for his own safety. The other a holy warrior, wise priest, healing-his-brother-all-the-time, warhammer and shield kinda guy, perhaps dwarven defender-ish. The two are a bit opposite of each other and argue like crazy, but love each other to death - they are both very protective, of each other and of their party members, and so will always insist on going in first. The two of them in the same party is a guaranteed stuck pair of dwarves in the doorway! I'd like to see the feat selections for each represent their personalities and combat styles. I've put together what I could think of to make them thematical, I'd love your input and expert help on making final builds of them! (<strong>RDD</strong> is not an option for these guys.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Joe-Jim Toughstone</strong><br/>\n Barbarian melee mentality; think dwarven berserker, battlerager. I once posted\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build117578.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">an ancient attempt at this guy</a>, lol! &gt;.&lt;<br/>\n<br/>\n Famous Last Words: \"Me first!\"<br/>\n<br/>\n Desired primary attributes\u00a0in order of prioritization: <ul><li>STR</li> <li>CON</li> </ul>\n Desired classes: <ul><li>Barbarian (preferably, 16 or more)</li> <li>Fighter (4 or more)</li> <li>Optional: Whatever else might work thematically and with the Barbarian alignment requirement (no opposing multiclassing, as you WoG'ers know).\u00a0<strong>Weapon Master</strong> is an option, though I fear the feats (and DEX and INT requiresments) might be a bit too demanding for little return on investment. I mention it as it\u00a0could be useful if many levels were taken so that he could really devot himself to that greataxe and apply the Improved Power Attack feat a lot - I understand there's quite a bit of AB to gain from high WM levels. \"That's soooo Joe-Jim!\" <strong>Rogue</strong> is also another option.</li> </ul>\n Desired feats are: <ul><li>Optional/Thematic:\u00a0Strong Soul</li> <li>WF/EWF: Greataxe</li> <li>WS/EWS: Greataxe</li> <li>Power Attack</li> <li>Cleave</li> <li>Great Cleave</li> <li>Improved Critical</li> <li>Overwhelming Critical</li> <li>Devastating Critical</li> <li>Optional/Thematic:\u00a0Improved Power Attack</li> <li>Knockdown</li> <li>Optional/Thematic:\u00a0Toughness</li> <li>Optional/Thematic:\u00a0Great Fortitude</li> <li>Optional/Thematic:\u00a0Epic Fortitude</li> <li>EDRIII</li> </ul>\n<strong>Tolkien Toughstone</strong><br/>\n The wiser brother, with a bit of a Lawful Stupid mentality showing itself when he insists on going first to protect everyone else.\u00a0I don't know clerics well so I'm not sure what feats are good for them, and I am not sure what might be considered \"a must\" in WoG. He needs to be able to hold himself in melee really well; being a cleric, that shouldn't be awfully hard to accomplish. I'd like to have him be outstanding at something that represents his personality, too. It's a plus if it's an opposite or compliment to Joe-Jim, like a super good healer - or something like getting a certain school of spell through, no matter what. He is primarily a caster, not a meleer. I'm also interested in more \"unusual cleric feats\" selections, perhaps; like Scribe Scroll, maybe Craft Wand, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n Famous Last Words: \"I should proably be handlin' this 'ere situation, lads.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n Desired primary attributes in order of prioritization: <ul><li>WIS</li> <li>CON</li> <li>STR</li> </ul>\n Desired deities: <ul><li>Moradin</li> <li>Clangeddin Silverbeard</li> </ul> \u00a0\n<blockquote><div>I know that we are only allowing for two domains per deity although most have more than that, but this is for scripting purposes and one of those things we will need to deal with.

I agree the names are crucial, it helps me define the concept, and that narrows the scope of what I'm cramming into the build. In fact, writing this up helped me see more clearly what I was going for (it's amazing how, when you explain something to others, you understand it better yourself) so I'll try the CBC for them both. I am still clueless on the cleric part, but at least two completed listing are something more concrete to comment on! :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Bear warrior is rough i told ya, he was one of my very first builds... And actually when i play i just make the build on the spot mostly, except from extremly tough ones with many pre-requisites or when i post a build on the forums of course. Barbarians are very cool and i have played both a (Barbarian 24/ Fighter 6/ CoT 10 - Dwarf) and a (Barbarian 24/ Rogue 10/ Fighter 6 - Half Orc), both are going to carry their weight in battles, especially if being made from the stocky blood and bones variety.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">The reason most Cleric-Warrior builds are going for exact 15 BAB pre-epic is that when they cast Divine Power afterwards the extra attack that comes once the spell resets your BAB to that of a Warrior (20 instead of 15) comes at the highest attack bonus of your character instead of giving you an extra attack at the last sequence. For example if you had let's say an attack routine of (40/ 35/ 30) with your Cleric, once you cast Divine Power this goes to (45/ 45/ 40/ 35) giving you essentially an extra attack with a +15 AB bonus.<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Trying a few paths to get what feels right. It will be something fun to play, which is more important to me than making the end numbers highest. I'm looking at the paths of different feats and it'll be heavy on fighter for them; it looks like a Barbarian 15-17, WM 7, and Fighter for the filler. He'll probably need to ditch some of the optional/thematic feats I listed, but that's OK.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks for the clarification on the Cleric at BAB 15  at pre-epics.

Feedback, please! I chose WM in pre-epic to take advantage of save boosts - I <em>think</em> I did that correctly. He's all about his Greataxe and how he can crit with it, and I had to pass on EDRIII and a lot of thematic feats like fortitude save boosters, strong soul (was kinda a thing like Thunder Twin that both brother's would have), and Improved Power Attack. He could maybe use Epic Skill Focus: Intimidate, but I wasn't sure on WoG if I needed that or not. I guess I could swap out 2 Great Strength for that and Improved Power Attack.<br/>\n<br/>\n Barbarian(17), Fighter(16), Weapon Master(7), Dwarf<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 16 (28)<br/>\n DEX: 13<br/>\n CON: 18<br/>\n WIS: 8<br/>\n INT: 13<br/>\n CHA: 6<br/>\n<br/>\n Dwarf: (Darkvision, Defensive Training vs. Giants, Stonecunning, Hardiness vs. Poison, Hardiness vs. Spells, Offensive Training vs. Goblinoids, Offensive Training vs. Orcs, Skill Affinity: Lore)<br/>\n 01: Barbarian(1): Weapon Focus: Greataxe<br/>\n 02: Fighter(1): Power Attack<br/>\n 03: Fighter(2): Cleave, Knockdown<br/>\n 04: Fighter(3): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n 05: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Greataxe<br/>\n 06: Fighter(5): Great Cleave<br/>\n 07: Fighter(6): Expertise<br/>\n 08: Fighter(7): STR+1, (STR=18)<br/>\n 09: Fighter(8): Dodge, Mobility<br/>\n 10: Fighter(9)<br/>\n 11: Fighter(10): Spring Attack<br/>\n 12: Barbarian(2): STR+1, Blind Fight, {Uncanny Dodge I}, (STR=19)<br/>\n 13: Barbarian(3)<br/>\n 14: Barbarian(4)<br/>\n 15: Barbarian(5): Whirlwind Attack<br/>\n 16: Barbarian(6): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n 17: Weapon Master(1): Weapon of Choice: Greataxe<br/>\n 18: Weapon Master(2): Improved Critical: Greataxe<br/>\n 19: Weapon Master(3)<br/>\n 20: Weapon Master(4): STR+1, (STR=21)<br/>\n 21: Barbarian(7): Epic Weapon Focus: Greataxe<br/>\n 22: Barbarian(8)<br/>\n 23: Barbarian(9)<br/>\n 24: Barbarian(10): STR+1, Great Strength I, (STR=23)<br/>\n 25: Barbarian(11)<br/>\n 26: Barbarian(12)<br/>\n 27: Barbarian(13): Great Strength II, (STR=24)<br/>\n 28: Barbarian(14): STR+1, (STR=25)<br/>\n 29: Fighter(11)<br/>\n 30: Barbarian(15): Overwhelming Critical: Greataxe<br/>\n 31: Fighter(12): Armor Skin<br/>\n 32: Fighter(13): STR+1, (STR=26)<br/>\n 33: Weapon Master(5): Devastating Critical: Greataxe<br/>\n 34: Weapon Master(6)<br/>\n 35: Weapon Master(7)<br/>\n 36: Barbarian(16): STR+1, Thundering Rage, (STR=27)<br/>\n 37: Fighter(14): Epic Weapon Specialization: Greataxe<br/>\n 38: Fighter(15)<br/>\n 39: Barbarian(17): Terrifying Rage<br/>\n 40: Fighter(16): STR+1, Epic Prowess, (STR=28)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 594<br/>\n Skillpoints: 169<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 27/15/20<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +2, Traps: +4, Poison: +2<br/>\n BAB: 30<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 44 (melee), 32 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 17/28<br/>\n Spell Casting: <br/>\n Alignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\n Discipline 43(52), Heal 2(1), Intimidate 42(40), Taunt 42(40), Tumble 20(21)<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Discipline(4), Intimidate(4), Taunt(4), Tumble(2), Save(4)<br/>\n 02: Discipline(1), Save(6)<br/>\n 03: Discipline(1), Tumble(1), Save(6)<br/>\n 04: Discipline(1), Save(8)<br/>\n 05: Discipline(1), Tumble(1), Save(8)<br/>\n 06: Discipline(1), Save(10)<br/>\n 07: Discipline(1), Tumble(1), Save(10)<br/>\n 08: Discipline(1), Save(12)<br/>\n 09: Discipline(1), Tumble(1), Save(12)<br/>\n 10: Discipline(1), Save(14)<br/>\n 11: Discipline(1), Tumble(1), Save(14)<br/>\n 12: Discipline(1), Intimidate(11), Taunt(7)<br/>\n 13: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1)<br/>\n 14: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(3)<br/>\n 15: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1)<br/>\n 16: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(3)<br/>\n 17: Discipline(1), Tumble(1)<br/>\n 18: Discipline(1), Intimidate(2)<br/>\n 19: Discipline(1), Tumble(1)<br/>\n 20: Discipline(1), Intimidate(2), <br/>\n 21: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1)<br/>\n 22: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(3)<br/>\n 23: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(3)<br/>\n 24: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(2)<br/>\n 25: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(4)<br/>\n 26: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(6)<br/>\n 27: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), Save(6)<br/>\n 28: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(1), Save(8)<br/>\n 29: Discipline(1), Tumble(1), Save(8)<br/>\n 30: Discipline(1), Intimidate(2), Taunt(2), Save(8)<br/>\n 31: Discipline(1), Tumble(1), Save(8)<br/>\n 32: Discipline(1), Save(10)<br/>\n 33: Discipline(1), Intimidate(3), Tumble(1), Save(7)<br/>\n 34: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Save(8)<br/>\n 35: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Tumble(1), Save(7)<br/>\n 36: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Taunt(6), Save(4)<br/>\n 37: Discipline(1), Tumble(1), Save(4)<br/>\n 38: Discipline(1), Save(6)<br/>\n 39: Discipline(1), Intimidate(3), Taunt(3), Save(4)<br/>\n 40: Discipline(1), Heal(2), Tumble(2)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">That's a cool build Jim and we can make it work as it is if you like, but before that let's take a good look at it.<br/>\n<br/>\n 1st) You are attempting to build a non-Human warrior with both weapon master and devastating critical pre-requisites. That's about 10 pre-epic feats right there only to be able to qualify for those things.<br/>\n<br/>\n 2nd) I am assuming here that this warrior will make his share of solo play. Without a class like Rogue inside the build you are going to miss major things out from the lack of UMD and not only that but your AC is currently 4 worse because you can only have 20 ranks in tumble as oppose to 40 a rogue would allow you to take.

That's about 10 pre-epic feats right there only to be able to qualify for those things.<br/>\n<br/>\n 2nd) I am assuming here that this warrior will make his share of solo play. Without a class like Rogue inside the build you are going to miss major things out from the lack of UMD and not only that but your AC is currently 4 worse because you can only have 20 ranks in tumble as oppose to 40 a rogue would allow you to take.

You are completely correct on all counts, I will add. I will reply to the points in the order you made them.<br/>\n 1) It's Greataxe critical maximizing, with Barbarian for Terrifying Rage and Thundering Rage. All feats were chosen as a way to show it could be done and to make <em>the sum of feat selections</em> the thematic part (instead of individual thematic feats - Strong Soul, Toughness, Great Fortitude, Epic Fortitude, etc. -\u00a0and many other \"plain good ones\").<br/>\n<br/>\n 2)\u00a0I really dislike losing out on EDRIII on this fellow, especially since he won't be able to soak up damage from having a two-hander and no shield, and no maxed Tumble.<br/>\n<br/>\n Responding to your \"Voice of Logic\" advice:<br/>\n I'm honestly wanting to see a version that neither take Devastating Critical\u00a0<em>nor</em> Weapon Master levels (hence, why I was drawn to the Bear Warrior), where I don't even take Improved Critical: Greataxe. Essentially, saving a lot of feats on completely avoiding <em>trying</em> to\u00a0score critical hits, and just getting AB and Damage Output as high as possible.\u00a0<em>This</em>\u00a0would be more of how Joe-Jim would be; he doesn't care to try to score critical hits. If they happen, they happen. He'd rather be chopping away tirelessly with a very high AB and Damage Output than trying to think, if that makes sense. However, I'd agree to raising his INT to a 10 for better skill points, and to go Barbarian/Fighter/Rogue - I'd probably not like Rogue in pre-epics; the only save that's important to him is the Fortitude save - that is definitely a thematical point about him that I'd love to get back to. Also - and this I love in WoG - he's meant to primarily use a Maul (two-handed hammer), so if I could get his AB high enough\u00a0I would even - for thematic reasons - ditch Weapon Focus: Greataxe, and maybe allow him a Warhammer and Shield combo, with EWF/EWS: Warhammer (like his brother might come to have). Sadly, the feats for WF, WS, EFS, EWS, WoC, etc., aren't enabled for the Maul (though they\u00a0<em>could be</em>,\u00a0with some drawbacks - I'll post about it on WoG's forums). I currently like the Bear Warrior more for Joe-Jim, and my posted\u00a0build more for one of their other clanmembers that would be an NPC, hahahah.<br/>\n<br/>\n That said, here's how I'd continue staying true to that.<br/>\n 1) &amp; 2): Yea!<br/>\n 3) I had chosen Thundering Rage to try to keep some of the thematic Battlerager in him. Clearly, the chosen path is spending almost every single feat on his weapon, and so many of them are all about critical hits from that greataxe! It felt silly not to include the very last one of them for those reason. I know it stacks with everything\u00a0<em>but</em> a massive critical property on a weapon (as I understand it, that's because Thundering Rage\u00a0<em>applies</em> that very property, temporarily, on the weapon in the right hand). Thus, this one is hard for me to give up in <em>this particular\u00a0</em>devoted path of the Greataxe. However, in almost any other variation of this build;\u00a0hell yea, I'd ditch it - looks like there might be 3 brothers, bwahahahah! J/K ;)\u00a0And, I'd be able to cut the Barbarian levels down to 15 instead of 17, as Thundering Rage and Terrifying Rage both needed to be taken on a Barbarian level, and after level 15 when the Greater Rage x 4 requirement was met - if there was a way to take them both at the same level at level 15, I missed it.<br/>\n 4) Yea!<br/>\n<br/>\n What about these three\u00a0options to potentially replace the two Great Strength feats?:<br/>\n - Epic Skill Focus: Intimidate for Terrifying Rage buff.<br/>\n - Improved Power Attack for thematic purposes; but is it actually\u00a0<em>useful</em>, too? If it's completely useless because of the -10 to-hit, then I don't care how thematic it is - it'd not be part of the build. However, you said in 4) that the AB is so high, Taunt isn't needed at all. If Taunt is kept, does it also make IPA more viable?<br/>\n - Epic Fortitude vs. either of the above two feats?<br/>\n<br/>\n I'll post another revision based on The Bear Warrior today, with what I said in the advice-reply as the variation, and based on what you said on page 1: <span style=\"color:#ECF3F7\">1st Brother) Barbarian 24/ Rogue 10/ Fighter 6, with Terrifying Rage, Crippling Strike, EWS, Devastating Critical, brandishing a Great Axe.</span>\u00a0But, without Devastating Critical, and <em>possibly </em>without any Weapon Focus whatsoever (he's more generic about his violence that way ;)).<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks for staying with it!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n -JimDandy<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I havent' tested it myself, but the stuff on the Wiki is usually very solid:\u00a0 <ul><li>The additional damage is implemented as a\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Massive_critical\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">massive critical</a>\u00a0item property, one which will not be applied if the weapon already has such a property.

All the knowledge I've been picking up lately has steered me towards an Elf (drow) concept that I'd like to flesh out and see if there aren't already acceptable builds of. It really helped a lot to write the character concepts/definitions down!<br/>\n<br/>\n As far as Tolkien Toughstone goes, I do wish for a caster-cleric more than a melee. Bone Breaker looks like a lot of fun, for sure, but I'd love to experience more from the Cleric. I've always enjoyed themed clerics, a la Undead Slayers or Healers, Protectors; more defensive that offensive, I think, but like I said he should still able to hold his own in melee thanks to just being able to tap into all the raw power from divine spells and wear fullplate and a tower shield.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
