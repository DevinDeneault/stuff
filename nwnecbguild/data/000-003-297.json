      "content": "<div>Neat idea Nwnwhite Boy but parry is broken in Neverwinder Nights, unfortunately.<br/>\n<br/>\n Since i am here though, let me point a couple of things,<br/>\n<br/>\n 1) DEX needs to remain at 13/14, no more is needed, yu don't want to split your stats like that and loose AB/Damage.<br/>\n 2) Your Class split is non-optimal, try Rogue 19/ WM 7/ CoT 14<br/>\n 3) Get rid of great cleave/ underwhelming critical unless you go for Devastating Critical.<br/>\n 4) Take a good look at your skills and set them at optimum ranks, for example your UMD score must be a modified 35.<br/>\n<br/>\n Hope i helped,</div>"

What would the benefits from being more Rogue be - more dmage from Sneak Attacks; Bouns feats?<br/>\n \u00a0For the Armor was thinking taking a 2 on my rolls for parry while waring breast plate of chainshirt - was bit of a toss up. Couldn't test it because of NwN having GL error 7. :P<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks :)<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>Sadly it seems that parry was reduced in effectiveness from it's original pre-game release and it's nearly useless. Here are the relevant passages from NwN Wiki,<br/>\n<br/>\n 1) Parry is a <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Combat_mode\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">combat mode</a>, so cannot be used at the same time as other combat modes<br/>\n 2) Parry only applies to using a melee weapon against melee attacks. It is useless against ranged attacks.<br/>\n 3) <strong>Parry can only deflect the first attack in each of the three</strong> <strong><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Flurry\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">flurries</a> in a round</strong> (for example, parrying an opponent with 5 attacks per round will only attempt to block the first, third, and fifth attacks).<br/>\n 4) Automatic hits (natural 20 attack rolls) cannot be parried<br/>\n 5) Riposte attacks are made with the character's normal (descending) attack bonus, not at full bonus each time<br/>\n<br/>\n Sadly, it is not viable... Good try though!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Lot's and lot's of things are broken or irrelevant iin NwN and never corrected even after so many patches, even worse those things are often hardcoded. Parry is one of them sadly but not the last. I suspect the original version of it, was tested briefly and found broken because Parry as a skill is way easier to rise versus an attacker's attack bonus and so they left it at this stage that only works for maybe the first ten levels of the game. A pity...</div>"
