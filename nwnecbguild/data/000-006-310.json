      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hey man,<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd like to make a couple of suggestions (actually a few) to try to improve this build a bit. To me it seems like this build is indeed feat-starved which makes you wonder whether Devastating Critical is actually worth all the trouble. Just for fun, let me try to suggest what it'd look like without it:<br/>\n<br/>\n- You would drop Power Attack, Cleave, Great Cleave and Improved Critical in pre-epics, or maybe keep IC and drop the other 3. Then you could move Empower and Maximize to pre-epics and take Extend Spell (then drop IC for Blind Fight if you want, that's up to you). Now the two Wizard bonus feats can be taken as Great Intelligence, which means two of your pre-epic stat increases can go to STR, granting you +1 AB and Damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n- You could start with 16 STR and 12 DEX, then, get rid of Armor Proficiency Heavy and take Armor Skin. This way, with an Empowered Cat's Grace Spell, you'd have at least the same AC, or +1 point in AC (Full Plate= 8+1=9, Chain Shirt= 4+4+2=10). In the worst case scenario, you'd have a +3 DEX modifier, but if you count, for example a Boots of the Sun Soul +5, which gives you +3 DEX, you'd be guarranteed to have +4 modified DEX all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Now, since your starting STR is 16 and you no longer have Devastating Critical, you can use these two feats to get 1 Great Strength (to compensate for lowering the starting STR) and an Epic Skill Focus: Discipline to make sure you'll be always erect and able to dish out spell or physical punishment to your foes.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if you drop DevCrit, you'd get +1 AB, +1 AC and +10 to Discipline, plus the ability to cast Extended buffs, which is very handy for a 26th level caster. IMO DevCrit is a good feat, but on this build, with so many feat requirements, just doesn't adapt very well.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, other than that it's a pretty solid spellsword.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Thus you'll have to manage your spellbook every time you reconnect. This is inconvenient enough for me to work my build around this problem. Also if you happen to reconnect during a fight, and all your 8-9 lvl spells vanish, you are looking for trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis does not happen in singleplayer, also I am not 100% sure if this is true for both Linux and Windows version of the NWN 1.69 server (I'll have to recheck).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Now, the incinvenience it causes can be resolves quite easily. You can log out before resting, when you relog, you'll have to redo the spells you lost, which are easy enough to memorize, and then you will be good to go. As for losing spells in the heat of battle, there is a way around it: You won't lose ALL spells, just a few of them, so what you can do to avoid that is to memorize your long term buffs in these slots, so that when you get disconnected, the spells you lose are the ones you already cast on yourself anyway. It's a mild pain in the behind, but it shouldn't be enough to prevent you from making your toon stronger IMHO. If they find a solution for it on WoG I'll let you know.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
