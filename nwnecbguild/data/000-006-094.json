After all, you do tout it as a Drow build.<br/>\nTo effect that, you would need a split something like Druid7/Shifter17/Fighter16.\u00a0 Likewise, you could replace Fighter with CoT for enormous save boost, or with Blackguard and pump Charisma instead of Constitution.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it's nice to see folks having fun with this stuff still.\u00a0 Cheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I agree with grizzled_dwarflord on switching to a Dru7/Shif17/Figh16 (or Dru7/Shif19/Figh14). Losing 5 feats for a build with this many Figh levels isn't really an issue. Swapping Epic Toughness 5 for Epic Drow Warrior, Undead Shape, and an EER feat is an easy choice, especially since you can add Toughness to partially make up for it.<br/>\nEven if you do stick with this build you should change the class spread to Dru7/Shif7/Figh26. Figh27 doesn't add anything to this build, and in exchange you get access to level 4 Druid spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nRace choice and ability spread are both perfect, there isn't anything that can be done to improve them.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I would drop Called Shot, since you already get Improved Disarm and Improved Knockdown.<br/>\nI would also drop Expertise and Improved Expertise since your AC will be terrible anyway, although if you play in an environment where AC item properties merge properly then they might be worth keeping.<br/>\nI'm not sure if Extend Spell is worth taking for this build since you don't have enough slots to really take advantage of it. Most of your buffs will be hours or turns per level, with extended Blood Frenzy only lasting for 14 rounds even with 7 Druid levels.<br/>\nUnless Perfect Health has been modified in the environment you'll use this build in you should drop it. The only way you'll fail a disease or poison check is if you roll a 1, and even if that happens you can simply remove it yourself with Druid spells.<br/>\nSwap Great Fortitude for Epic Fortitude, if you want Great Fortitude as well then swap it with a pre-epic feat.<br/>\nIf you plan to stick with this build then you should also shuffle your feats to replace Epic Toughness 5 with Great CON 4 and Toughness for better HP, saves, and skills.<br/>\nTaking Epic Toughness is usually a sign of either a poorly optimised build or a build with too many feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suggest you move the points in Listen and Spot elsewhere, at higher levels there's no real difference between 15 Listen/Spot and 0 Listen/Spot.<br/>\nConsider putting 1 point into Disable Trap and Open Lock so that you can at least attempt to use them.<br/>\nIf you take your final Dru level at 40 then you can get 45 Spellcraft (43 ranks, 2 INT) for an extra +1 saves vs spells at the cost of 1 Discipline.<br/>\nAlso consider streamlining the skill progression instead of using Tumble dumps, since the extra Tumble at lower levels will help with avoiding AoOs. Once you have 14 modified Tumble then you can switch back to Tumble dumps, although it might be best to keep it streamlined in case of Curse Song or other skill decreasing effects.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The only (major) foul that I saw afterward, was that he didn't go for the Epic Drow shape when it kinda is the whole point of this build, fewer feats or not. Besides, at epic levels, the lesser Drow shape probably won't cut it at all. He should also try to make his posts a little more readable too. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I wanted to mention here one of the major reasons why most \"shape-shifter\" builds are not more well-known &amp; why not many people play them, Dragon-shape excluded, of course.\u00a0 The Dark Musketeer's AB is 34. Not 44, but 34. Let that sink in for a while. Yes, back in the day many people, myself included have played such characters &amp; I have no problem playing them again, but they are not exactly hot material, so to speak. You can optimize the build further, with Epic Drow-shape &amp; reach an AB of 37 &amp; with the +6 longsword that's included with that form, have an AB of 43 (49 w/maxed-out strength). It then becomes playable in my opinion. Epic kobold commando gets +2 AB over that along with HiPS &amp; 5d6 sneak-attack as well, plus it looks very funny, making it the go-to humanoid shape for such things, no wonder Mick made such a build a while ago\u00a0<img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks a lot, francois, it's appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as your thoughts for other builds go, I'm afraid you're asking the wrong man. I'm in the midst of building my first caster - a Sorcerer, as it happens, which is of no use to you - and I've never played, let alone built, a Druid or Shifter. I'd pop your thoughts into a build request and let those of the Guild who know what they're talking about offer their advice.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as a Fighter/ WM/ Bard or Wiz is concerned, it will really depend on what you want to focus on. Just getting to WM takes 6 feats, only leaving you 2 pre-epic (assuming you go human, otherwise 1) ones, and you'll most likely be wanting Blind Fight and at least one of the Knockdowns, as well as Imp Crit and Weapon Finesse if you're going for a Dex build. Of course, you can take some of these as Fighter bonus feats, but the more Fighter you take, the less room you'll have for the other classes - and if you're investing so many feats into just getting WM, a few piddling levels seems something of a waste. If you want Bard or Wiz merely for buffing purposes, I'd be tempted to forget the spells and use Bard Song - maybe something like a Fighter 8/ WM 22/ Bard 10? Again, though, I'd put something up on the build requests forum: you're likely to get better suggestions that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
