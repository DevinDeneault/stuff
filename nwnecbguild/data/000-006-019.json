You take the 6th Bard level at 28, then in your thirties you start taking Bard to get to 12, where your spells aren't all that better, your song is, but look at what it's costing you, and you do get more skill points. If you want more skills, I'd go Bard 16 at least, if you want more feats, Fighter 26 Bard 4 is good if you delay RDD to epics.

I think I have struck a good balance between feats and skills for my needs. I would have to give up some of one to get more of the other. The Aielund Saga is full of really cool weapons, and I want to be free to use any weapon I come across.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought to myself \"How can I be effective without Weapon Focus, Weapon Spec, etc?\" The answer I came up with was extra STR from RDD levels.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I don't know whether you'll ever leave the Aielund Saga and start playing online, but as a general rule, you become a better player when you migrate to online play. If you play Aielund with a really good build, like for example my Magical Master, you can LITERALLY just click on attack and then go for a cup of coffee and when you come back, everything will be dead. When you play without pause, for starters, and in a place where you can be very dead in just a couple of seconds, you begin to value and appreciate more the usefulness of stuff like Knockdown. The thing is that in certain places, if you don't KD a monster, you'll DIE to it, be it by a medusa petrifying gaze, an instant death spell or petrification spell, an Implosion spell cast by a boss, etc... I know Aielund, I love it, but the items are a bit on the overpowered side. Not enhancement-wise, but immunity-wise, which is kinda bad because lots of immunities de-value a lot of the class features, which causes players to do exactly what you just mentioned: not using stuff that is very good. I know that in the very beginning of act 2 you can already get an item called Cowl of Warding, which makes you immune to fear and mind affecting spells. That may lead to the very wrong impression that potions of Clarity are useless, but I ALWAYS carry a couple of stacks of them in my meleers, because I know I won't succeed on a Will save EVER in a balanced environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust food for thought. Later on, if you do decide to follow my advice, you`ll look back and see what now is hidden to you. If you keep learning, in 3 years try playing the Aielund saga again and you`ll see exactly what I mean!<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Now, I appreciate the +8AC from Tumble (who doesn't?), but the skill itself becomes increasingly negated when wearing big-boy armour, so I try to balance Armour AC with other elements when DW-ing (tower shields bugger Tumble anyway, so it's not an issue for single-wielding). In other words, I'll try to make the most possible use of my stats - if I can get +2, 3, 4, etc, DEX, I'll often sacrifice 'better' armour to use it (for example, taking Mail of Speed over Red Dragon Armour - thereby also freeing up the boots slot for Sun Souls with UMD). Thus, I wasn't clear on why not to have a 15 rising to 16 DEX character with (eg) 8 WIS, rather than a 14 rising to 15 DEX with 10 WIS.<br/>\n<br/>\n I hope this makes sense, though I'm not entirely sure.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Also, and this is Aielund-specific, you'll finish at around CL 36-37, so the Epic Toughness won't get taken in any case.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Looking at the end-game, a little tweaking might be in order. You should know by about level 34, roughly, whether you'll be finishing at 36 or 37, but provided you can get 16 levels of Fighter in and 11 Bard you'll be fine. If you finish at 36, you'll have to decide whether taking the final level in Bard or Fighter would be better for your character.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The song will decrease enemies' AB by at least 1 and affects all those in the vicinity, while Dodge brings you +1 AC against one enemy. Admittedly, Dodge is always \"on\", while the song is short-term and needs to be selected, but it might be something to consider. Maybe? That way you wouldn't have such a huge feat-juggling job, just bring the Bard level in at 6 or 9 instead of 7.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat means you'd be keeping Great Cleave, but if you'd prefer not to, you could insert Dodge in its place.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Or, you could do this instead: Replace <em>Dodge </em>with <em>Toughness </em>=&gt; Take <em>Curse Song</em> at 18th level &amp; then replace <em>Great Cleave</em> with <em>Dodge</em>. There are many other ways to do this but this should suffice. Regardless, <em>Great Cleave</em> shouldn't be there in the first place, much better would be <em>Mobility </em>instead since you've already invested in <em>Dodge</em>. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat would you rather have for your character? +2AB/+2AC/+2DR, OR<em> Great Cleave</em>?
