      "content": "<div>Thank you both for your responses!<br/>\n<br/>\n I haven't played in about a decade, so I'm definitely a little rusty when it comes to builds.<br/>\n<br/>\n I guess you could take my build request as having two portions (which I should have been more clear about):<br/>\n<br/>\n 1.  What kind of role would be recommended for my character in a 3-party group with a Summoner Druid and a Ranger (I think the latter wants to go melee focus, but it's not entirely clear).  They're probably going to hire henchmen, too.  If I don't hire a henchman, would I still lose XP because they've got henchmen?<br/>\n<br/>\n 2.  Within that role, what are some suggested builds?  I have trawled the various build areas of this forum, and a big part of the issue is I'm not sure what kind of role I should take.  I'm really ok with trying anything out; going with what's familiar isn't always the best way to enjoy a game.  I could see going melee/tank, going support (bard or archer), or going for an arcane powerbuild.<br/>\n<br/>\n Let me rephrase my melee comment:  I don't prefer relying on single-round skills or spells in melee (I understand that True Strike is fairly powerful for a Spellsword, but I find myself struggling to know when the perfect time to use these kinds of one-shot melee skills/spells in RPG's).<br/>\n<br/>\n Why is it a bad idea to multiclass for pre-epic builds?<br/>\n<br/>\n We may well play all the way to 40 with additional campaigns, but I kind of think it would be fun to play a character that optimizes a little earlier; I understand that many builds, while playable at lower levels, optimize for level 30 or 40, and make sacrifices at earlier levels to get to that point.  I'd prefer something that is as efficient of a power-build for the early epic levels, rather than something that continues to sacrifice to \"max out\" later.  Also, since it's not clear I'll hit level 30 playing HotU, and I'm not positive that we'll play a community module afterwards, it made sense to me to try to optimize for level 25, which I'm likely to hit.<br/>\n<br/>\n Once again, thank you for your help.</div>"

<br/>\n<br/>\nAny of the classes that enforce a rigid alignment prereq could potentially become just as unplayable (meaning: \"unplayable as designed on paper\") depending on the actions you chose and those could seem benign to many players.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and YES.\u00a0 Your entire party will be penalized at the rate of approximately 10-15% XP per party member (each of the portraits that appears on the RH side of the screen).\u00a0 So, not only will your mates be draining each other's kills but so will their henchfolk and summons.\u00a0 For that reason, if you want to glean as much XP as possible, it's best to have your hench provide buffs and then dismiss them until the encounter has ended.\u00a0 It can become tedious, though.\u00a0 When I play, I tend to drag my hench along for moral support but leave them standing around waiting the rest of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not envy your decision to attempt the SoU/HotU campaigns as multiplayer.\u00a0 Our little group tried it several years back and, eventually, after much rescripting and manipulation via SQL, were able to get those modules to work okay for multiplayer.\u00a0 The same goes for any of the so-called bridge modules and other SP extentions.\u00a0 To play as multiplayer usually requires some serious customizations that only an experienced scripter and DB manager can accomplish in short order.\u00a0 Sometimes the creator will advertise their modules as suitable for multiplayer and even furnish a maximum party size.\u00a0 That is not the case for any of the Bioware-designed modules. Those are ALL intended for SP only by default. So Good Luck!<br/>\n\u00a0</div>"
