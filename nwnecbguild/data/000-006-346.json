      "content": "<div><strong>CONFLICTED SNIPER</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nBACKGROUND<br/>\n<br/>\nThis archer suffers from Dissociative-Identity-Disorder and just can't quite come to grips with a direction in life.  Human or elf?  Arcane or divine tricks?  Sing while hunting or stalk in silence?  Sport a permanent wave or opt for a punk Mohawk?  Decide already, will ya?  The clock's tickin'!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe evolution of this schizo persona is a multi-faceted archer that can maintain control in most environments.  And like most snipers, likes to bias the stage in its favor and move the pieces to its advantage.  In other words... EXPLOIT!  Cast Darkness or HoG and shoot 'em with impunity while they are blind or dazed.  Then enter sanctuary, wash up a bit, check out the scenery and when good and ready... well, you can see where this in going, eh?  Hey, who said domination had to be fair? *lol* <br/>\n<br/>\nThis build, like most, is an experiment.  I always wanted to play a cleric AA so checked out most all the related builds.  The first attempt I built  and played was an uber attack Dex finessing version between 70-80 AB that had little diversity.  Efficient, boring and fragile killing machine.  These types of builds can become a very environment-specific decision, but from what I have experienced, one doesn't need AB levels drastically-elevated to succeed on most servers, so I decided on another tactic.  BTW, I never, ever duel.  That there is the most I will ever mention about PvP.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am a sucker for UMD.  Just love how it can open up new avenues, both in combat strategy and for pure fun.  Therefore, my deviate archer needed at least some semblance of animal magnetism in the repertoire.  Also, I never used Taunt very much so figured it was time to see a puny archer do some ridiculing for once.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut it was this race issue that was confusing.  Why settle for such a lame health level just to save a single feat... especially if going with high Wis?  It just didn't make sense, especially with the constricting XP penalty tugging at one's sleeves.  XP penalty is taboo in my vocabulary.  I dislike falling behind in the party's progress for the sake of conserving a single feat.  Now, if there is a delevel/relevel utility, the penalty issue becomes moot since you can relevel however you like as long as the creation level is correct.  But let us assume this is intended for play within the vanilla ruleset, shall we?  Good.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere are a couple builds that had some aspects that meshed with my goal during my research:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build223730.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">pocketbeetle's RareBreed Clc15/Brd2/AA23 Elf</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build266063.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">johann_howitzer's New Inspiring Bowyer Clc20/Brd12/AA8 Elf</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJust about all the bard builds ran into the elven XP penalty syndrome.  I did make an elven bard version that caused no XP problem, but it was in no way as solid as this build. Most just use bard for dumps and that is all.  Several of the builds were dexers (which makes a lot of sense as far as maxing AB), but boring like the one I threw together... or high Wis caster clerics who could shoot the bow a little.  So, finally, here is the monstrosity in all its glory with sparkly neon lights...<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease dissect to your heart's content.

It is essential in this build to keep the pre-epic BAB @Lvl 20 no higher than 15.  And it was not easy to do.  It surprised me how few AA levels I was limited to before 16 BAB was reached.  (Check the Crunch section to see how this worked out, if you are interested in how a manic-depressive misspent his waking moments. *g*)<br/>\n<br/>\n2.  Curse Song is surely an excellent adjunct to this build if you are comfortable wading in a bit closer into the fray than I am accustomed to.  There always seems to be at least one scout or picket roaming about that causes trouble when trying to curse the mob... so one can get bitten easily if not careful.  Lingering Song makes a big difference with that extra 5 rounds so that is my own choice.  Either one is worthwhile IMO, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.  Although Rapid Shot is selected, TBH, I never use it.  I mean, I often select the feat, but in practice I always forget about it, attack at full AB with one less APR, then frantically selecting the RS mode quickslot only to realize all the mob is dead.  Never really noticed much lack in killing power with 5 APR (hasted) though for a DevCrit build of some sort, it would be more noticeable, I suppose.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut RS is very popular so I figured I'd display the figures and let the community make their own decision as to what makes the most sense. My personal choice would have been to drop the Grt Dex at Lvl 37, select Great Fort (Imploders seem to own me so this would help a low Con archer) and Blind fight at Lvl 39.  Archers don't really need BF against the melee threat (if they play artillery right!) but the override of concealeds is well worth it.  Dang shadows!!!  It's not a crime leaving Dex at 12 either (maybe create with Str 10, Dex 10?).<br/>\n<br/>\n4. It is best to either use robes or unequip armor while buffing with Bard spells.  Still spells are beyond the scope of the feat selection in this build. Control casting failure to utilize the few helpful arcane spells.  This build assumes there will not be casting during combat other than occasionally divine spells (like Heal, Restoration, Sanctuary or Darkness, for instance).<br/>\n</span></div>"

      "content": "<div>As a \"self buffing with limits\" archer, it works. I'd still go elf and bite the XP penalty (which can be delayed until Cleric 10 well into epic) and get +1 preepic and +1 epic feats (from the freed up martial weapon prof and Great Dex). STR 8 considering you can wear full plate is gonna be an issue, ease of play wise. Lingering Song is not a bad idea. Scribe Scroll/Craft Wand might be pretty desirable feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd look into Cleric 17/Bard 4/AA 19 and up to Cleric 26/Bard 3/AA 11 or similar for a stronger clerical buffing/magical presence. You could easily drop Cha in those cases and forget about bard song, using bard purely for skilldumps... now that I think about it I have something similar in my own archive, eh</div>"
