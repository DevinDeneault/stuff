Us4y_mqpBc</a>\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n For my first rebirth I need a build with 30SD Levels and SC5, this will give me a permanent 65% Concealment and + Natural AC. \u00a0For this I was going to take\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n -Syrath's Iconic Shadowdancer\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build153573.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 53573.html</a>\u00a0and drop 2 of the fighter levels for the 2 extra SD levels.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n For my second rebirth I need a build \u00a0with either 30Wiz Levels and 30 Base Int which will give me a permanent 50% SR and immunity to all spells 5th level and below. \u00a0For this I was going to slightly modify\u00a0<br/>\n -Griz's War Wizard\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build231822.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 31822.html</a>\u00a0<br/>\n or<br/>\n a build with 25 Ranger Levels and 30 Base Dex which will give me +5 AB on each weapon and +15 Deflection AC to my off hand. \u00a0I haven't really looked at a build for this.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n The main things to remember are that it is a stripping of xp, not a reroll so Race, Class, Stats and first level feat(s) need to be the same for each build. \u00a0I was going to use Rogue. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Also it is a high magic world (+10) with lots of +ele dmg available via scrolls or forging so WS/EWS is not as crucial as it usually is for dex builds. \u00a0\u00a0Race is not important as XP is pretty easy to come by but Elf would be preferred.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n I realise this is a big ask but I thought it might add a bit of a fresh approach to the building process.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks in Advance !<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hey Kal!<br/>\n<br/>\n I was wondering what exactly is it that you want from us? Do you want us to build you a Rogue Fighter CoT?<br/>\n<br/>\n I have a very good high AB dex-based build you should also look at. It's called Drow Fencer, which is incidentally an Elf as well. It reaches an unbuffed AB of 47.<br/>\n<br/>\n However, if you want something along the lines of Mick's or Grizz's builds, I would advise the optimal spread of Rogue 16 / CoT 14 / Fighter 10 or if you think the saves are more important than the feat (which they probably are) Rogue 16 / Fighter 6 / CoT 18. Pre-epic you can go Fighter 6 Cot 10 Rogue 4 and drop 1 BAB for loads of pre-epic feats or go Rogue 8 Fighter 5 CoT 7, which would save you three feats to take in Epics, so you'll have FTR 6 for EWF, COT 8 for AS, COT 10 for EP, COT 14 for EWS AND COT 18 for maybe Epic Fortitude, plus you'll get a much earlier Epic Dodge in this setup cuz all your general epic feats can be Great Dexterities.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi Max,<br/>\n<br/>\n Essentially I am looking for 3 builds that are identical at level 1. (Race, Class, Stats, Feats)<br/>\n<br/>\n The first is a Ranger 25/Rogue?/? with 30 Dex<br/>\n<br/>\n The second is a Shadowdancer30/Rogue?/? with SC5<br/>\n<br/>\n And the third a ITWF, ED Fighter?/Rogue?/?? (probably either WM or COT)<br/>\n<br/>\n The way it works is you level the first and get to a certain point in the main quest and can get dropped back to level 1 but gain a +5 AB on each hand and +15 Deflection AC for 20mins/3x a day<br/>\n<br/>\n Then you do the same again but this time you gain a 65% concealment and +5 Natural AC for 20mins/3x a day<br/>\n<br/>\n The you level the third build which in addition to being a ITWF, ED F/R/? also has 65% Concealment, +20 AC and +5AB on each hand for 20mins/3x a day<br/>\n<br/>\n I forgot to mention that RDD and PM can only be taken in the third build (Not really applicable here but I'll just put it out there anyway)<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks !<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
