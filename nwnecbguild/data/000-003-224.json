It will technically give you 1 AB (+1 modifier). The Warcry spell alone gives you 2 AB. Now, considering stat buffs, such as Bull's Strength, you can gain +1 or +2 AB more, GMW will give you +5 to AB (neglectible on HoTU, but very useful on non-uber-magic worlds and up to that point too). And when have you ever seen a HoTU monster cast dispel? LOL! They never do! And isn't it great that you only need 14 CHA to cast your spells cuz RDD will GIVE YOU the other 2 to CHA for free? As I see it, it's a win / win situation. Your Warcry is a short duration buff,\u00a0and with 16 Bard levels, you can extend it at level 6, since you won't have any known spells on that level, but will be able to cast 6th level spells\u00a0and since you have such high DEX, Arcane Spell Failure can be avoided with a simple unequipping of the shield.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div></div>"
