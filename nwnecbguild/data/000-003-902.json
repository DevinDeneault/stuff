Is this guy even worth building? I wanted a DR tank with decent AC and AB with epic Dodge. This here is the worst build I've come up with so far:<br/>\n<br/>\n*7 (8 w/ divine power scroll) attacks, Epic Dodge, almost max DR, competitive AC/AB, and all the rogue goodies like UMD, traps, and open lock because why not. I figured with UMD and a scroll/wand/crafting character to supplement you could pull together respectable numbers, such as with divine power. It is technically playable throughout and can even solo alright but let's face it, this is a level 40 build that was way to greedy. <br/>\n<br/>\nImportant note: This character was made for Blackstone Keep (fairly high magic), so no multi-class pen that I can tell, otherwise you have a multi-class penalty starting from 17.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreedy Dwarf:<br/>\n<br/>\nRogue(13), Dwarven Defender(26),

Too greedy?\n</div></blockquote>\n\nI think this is an inventive build, for better or worse. <br/>\nIt is a common mistake for new players to make too ambitious builds. They want too much in, and end up making something weak, because the build lacks focus. <br/>\nPeople that want to learn improve. Nothing insane with that.<br/>\n<br/>\nDefensively, you get a lot of things right with fair saves, a high Con, ED and a lot of DR. You even overdo it a bit when you have UD from Rogue in a DD build.<br/>\nAB is OK'ish for a rogue, nothing stellar, but something a rogue can live with.\u00a0But it doesn't live up to fighter types standards. You take a level of monk to be able to use the UBAB schedule with Kama in robes. An AC of 29 is only so,so. But the ED and DR repairs that to some degree ( I have not calculated how well atm.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a dex build and needs a way to deal serious damage with the Kamas. Here Thorsson's post is to the point. You have SAs and UMD to buff your weapons from scrolls. You don't have stealth skills, so you depend completely on either IKD or quaffing potions of invisibility to land SAs. With that AB of 38, it can be a bit of a challenge to land IKDs consistently in a toe to toe combat.<br/>\nYou have an interesting skill selection, with UMD, a maxed listen skill and trap skills for epic traps.<br/>\nUMD may save your day (or not) with weapon buffs from scrolls. The epic trap skills make this build a dangerous trapper, something very unusual for a DD. The lack of stealth skills may make it difficult to scout enemies you want to trap. But also here invisibility potions may be a solution.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinal judgement: This inventive build has several strengths and weaknesses. How well it fares depends heavily on where you play: What you are up against and what items that are available. There is also that challenge that a build like this depends equally well on the skill of the player; to use it's strengths and find ways to minimize the weaknesses.<br/>\n<br/>\nMick<br/>\nAuthorized sanity evaluator <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks for the input guys! Looking it over I realize this build makes a lot more sense when you have context.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlackstone keep is fairly high magic and easy to get a group together. I admit I'm leaning heavily into my current socketed Kama that has 3 extra sources of damage and scrolls from a cleric crafter. Invis and darkfire are easy to come by. I don't think this build has a hope in any other magic setting. <br/>\n<br/>\nI want to be able to heavily punish enemies that look away from me with sneak attack and tank effectively when they get mad. With access to enough items to heavily buff Str, Dex, and Wis I figure the AC and damage can be respectable.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess the question is can he be a good addition to a team of 3? This guy, an AA, and a spellcaster? Or should I just be a good nwn player and build a defensive Andariel?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You put all available upgrades on the weapons. It will wither down any* strength build, no matter how powerful, unless they regenerate more than you are able to damage, in which case you have a stalemate.<br/>\n<br/>\n*There are monster bosses on multiplayer PWs that are made to even outlast this, to encourage team play.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
