I need a build for a \"beginner\", that is easy to play and has no problems to kill every mob in his way (main campaign and two addons). <br/>\n<br/>\nCan you recommend a build? I don't know how important lockpick is anymore, but i hate it, if i can not open locks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hello and welcome, BG2 (which I'm currently in the midst of replaying)!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, what you see as a nice, straightforward question actually isn't. We're going to need some more info first, I'm afraid.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, are you looking to be a good old fashioned \"Hulk bash, Hulk smash!\" type; a sneaky back-stabber; a shooter; a caller upon the divine; or a user of the infernal arts? (Me, I love monks, but prefer unarmed where possible).<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, do you want to be strength, dexterity, wisdom, intelligence or charisma based? (I would have included constitution, but that really only comes into its own in epic levels.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, you say you hate it if you can't open locks - would you mind smashing them open instead?<br/>\n<br/>\nFourth, you do know that the Original Campaign (OC) will end when you're around level 17 or 18, don't you? And that Shadows of Undrentide and Hordes of the Underdark (SoU &amp; HotU) are not meant to follow on from the OC? If not, you'll find no challenge at all in SoU, because you're supposed to start that from level 1. By the end of HotU (which follows SoU) you should be around level 27/28. Thus, if you want to use the full level 40 extent, you'll need some other modules (we can talk more about that later). If not, have look at the Level 20 and Level 30 sub-sections of this forum. And if you want a nice \"Lops off heads like nobody's business\" build, I highly recommend Mick Dagger's Brawler Champion.<br/>\n<br/>\nEffectively, treat the OC as a \"primer\", to get you more used to playing, and different styles of playing as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat'll teach you to ask simple questions!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

      "content": "<div>Ok, BG2, if you want nice and easy to play that still kicks ass all the way, a good melee build seems right. I still struggle to think of a better one than Mick Dagger's aforementioned Brawler Champion (found in the level 20 sub-forum here - have a look).<br/>\n<br/>\nI've yet to meet anyone who's gone beyond level 29 in SoU/HotU, or level 19 in the OC (and even if you take the 3 together you still won't get beyond level 28/9). As far as I know, the only ways to get to level 40 in modules are through adding either Mines of Twin Summit (which moves you from the end of the OC comfortably up to 40), or Sands of Fate after SoU/HotU (taking you from level 28-40). If you'd like to try the\u00a0 best NwN has to offer in terms of modules, go for Aielund, which will get you from level 1 all the way to 36/7 with one brilliant storyline. They're dead easy to install - even a nidjit like me can do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless, remember, no build beats everything all the time - until you get to know it</div>",
