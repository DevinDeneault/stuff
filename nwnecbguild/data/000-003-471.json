      "content": "<div>I would not pick halfling as race. You lose 2 ability points from strength. You have no need for the extra dexterity the race provides. Paladin has immunity to fear as a class feature. Compared to human you also lose 1 feat and 1 skill. If you don't want more skills, human let you free up 2 stat points from intelligence for more strength, constitution or charisma. Halfling has the AC and AB bous of small stature, but the strength penalty alone steals 1 AB and 1 damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would not focus on charisma. The saves are better, but the AB penalty is -4 compared to a str 20 build. The short lived DM damage is not better than what you will get on a steady basis from strength in a strength focused build. DS will give you a short AC boost, but wouldn't expertise be just as good or better? IMO charisma builds get better in epic levels, especially when you mix paladin with CoT.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you pick rogue at lvl 1 you will gain 18 skillpoints.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince you take rogue levels, why do you not take skills like search, disarm traps, open lock etc?</div>",

But when I put halfling here, it was for RP more, cause I can't imagine pal/rogue of any orher race... And it's a shame, but I never played or build a paladin before...<br/>\n<blockquote><div>I would not focus on charisma. The saves are better, but the AB penalty is -4 compared to a str 20 build.

With capped CHA I will have 20 DS attempts, each 66 seconds long, that's over 20 minutes with +11 AC, or 11 minutes with +11AC and +11 damage. I thought, this is why people make CHA-based paladins.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>If you pick rogue at lvl 1 you will gain 18 skillpoints.</div></blockquote>\nYeah, I made it looking at my PW difference, maybe i needed to make a standart one first.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>Since you take rogue levels, why do you not take skills like search, disarm traps, open lock etc?</div></blockquote>\nMaybe, most because of PR purposes, since I'm of LG alignment and it would be strange, if i start open locks while beibg a paladin...</div>"

Or were you planning on foregoing DM in combat altogether?<br/>\n<br/>\nTotal Turn Undead attempts @level 20 = 3 (base) + 5 (CHA 20) + 6 (Extra Turning feat) + 2 (Max Eagle's)= 16 MAX! (could be only 15 with low dice roll on Eagle's buff).  Split these attempts between DM/DS (assumes full buff) and you get 8 uses (MAX!) each per day with duration of 5-7 rounds per attempt (approx 1/2 turn or 30-40 secs) depending on buff roll.  The extended duration you have quoted also includes 16 re-buff rounds, 1 per each of DM &amp; DS separately, unless you are hasted, in which case it will be a slightly faster buff.  Ever try re-buffing while getting pummeled by archers or casters or trying to escape to safety to re-buff without incurring a mass of AoOs?  Not a pretty outcome... which is why most folks consider the 5-7 round buff as the true output of this configuration in practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo where are you getting the other 4 Turn Undead attempts from (re: 20) ?  Gear (like that +5 nymph cloak Max seems to be able pull out his pocket upon request *lol*)?  BTW,  The term \"capped\" can be misleading when trying to assess the features of any build since it usually applies to a high-magic environment.  Is THAT where you plan to play this bugger?  That's one characteristic of CHA-based builds I've noticed: They tend to be item-dependent for some reason. <br/>\n<br/>\nEmpowered Spell (to get Eagle's to +3) may not help much due to slot limitations (I am assuming you would be using HS and/or other level 4 buffs in this slot).</div>"

So really it's not a big problem to make 32 CHA.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, if I still want make CHA-based paladin, what i need to put into this build?</div>"

      "content": "<div>A slight guide I wrote can be found in the link below, that's where I would start if I had never built a Paladin before:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/the-holy-class-a-guide-to-paladins-t515492.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/the-h ... 15492.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNow, talking about the build at hand, why 16 levels of Paladin? What do you want from them? If it's level 4 spells, 15 levels are enough, so why not go Paladin 15 Rogue 5 for +1 d6 Sneak Attack damage? Or Paladin 15 Rogue 3 Fighter 2 for 2 extra feats (then you could get KD / IKD)? <br/>\n<br/>\nI can understand the CHA-based argument, but then you'd have to be pretty sure you will hit often (AKA the monsters you'll be fighting have low AC). If so, then your argument is plausible. I would drop Great Cleave for Expertise, as it can be used in conjunction with Taunt to lower enemy AC's to make them hittable. To see how to use that combo, look for my Holy Weapon Master with Cheese build in the level 40 section. I explain in detail how it works.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't really like that build there as it is, I think it needs a lot of improvement. 13 STR is pathetic, and I concur with my mates that Halfling is the most terrible choice you could make rationally speaking. But RP isn't supposed to be rational, so if you decide to keep the race as is, please drop CON to 8 and start with 14 STR. You lose 20 HP, but get a much needed point in AB and a little less terrible damage. I would also drop Cleave for Improved Critical, as there is a bug that makes Cleave target the same enemy you just killed if it happens to be triggered by the first attack each flurry and Paladins have some nice damage buffs that are multiplied on crits.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's start with these tweaks and we can move on from there.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"
