To put it simply, I wanted to create a master of death.<br/>\nWith Devastating Critical , a ton of immunities similar to an undead creature and EXTREMELY hard to kill... I love it.<br/>\nThe main problem with this build is levelling. With critical immunity reached at level 33, Devastating Critical is reached at level 36 and Epic Warding at level 39, this is definitely for level 40 play only.<br/>\nHowever, this build is able to survive almost any non-magical attack, and with monk speed, not many mages will be able to keep up.<br/>\nDevastating Critical DC = 38 Fort. Stunning Fist = 33 Fort.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayability: Level 40 PVP + PVM.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk(21), Wizard(3), Pale Master(16), Elf<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 16 (26)<br/>\nDEX: 10<br/>\nCON:

(Note: yes, I know, for most melee AB 44-45 is the \"good\" standard, average out there, just saying that not all are average, eh? But for the \"lot\" if you will, heh, not exactly making it easy for them, and I like that). Meantime, with crit/sneak immunity, I'm seeing an awful lot of crit.crazy WMs shaking their heads, poking away with the scimmys ... and that is pretty funny. However, the trade-off for such a nice defense is so little offense in turn: with an AB 37 (-2 flurry), Necrom won't be hitting much except on a d20 and, as against melee, a DC 38 dev.crit isn't that great. Still, quite nice to be immune to theirs for sure (warning: don't be messing with high STR dragons, though, who pack a serious crackdown with all that STR of theirs, and they KD really good, too). But to pound on you they first have to catch you, right? And with all that monk speed, heh, you aren't exactly making it easy for them to kill you (difficult to kill that which you have a hard time catching--good thinking!), <br/>\n<br/>\nA nice surprise in store for the mages, though, whose fort saves for the most part just aren't that great, this is true (nor are they typically disciplined when it comes to the KD/IKD either); again, AB here is very much a problem (they'll be buffed up the wazzoo, etc.). Ah, and if only going to hit them on a d20, heh, make it count! Problem is getting over to them, though. They've some really nice AoE damage spells among other things at their disposal (monk 21 has SR 31; not enough; but PM immunity to stun, hold, paralysis, etc. is rather nice as against some of those Bigby's, which helps).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere Necrom would shine of course would be PvM/E, only problem as you say is that it takes him a long time to get there. Might want to have a look at the Pulse/Search engine and see other, similar combos for some ideas. Did a search for you (which you're supposed to do before posting, to see if there's something similar out there and if so how yours differs, though many in the engine are quite old, in need of updating in light of 1.69 which is a bit of a problem since many of their original authors no longer actively involved in NWN, so ...). In any event, here you go:<br/>\n<br/>\n15 Combos in the Pulse/Search engine, about half are high caster/PMs, other 7 being high monk/PM builds, (well, actually 8, but one's a DEX'er so a very different build of course in turn).
