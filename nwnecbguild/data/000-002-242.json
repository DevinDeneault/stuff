And, provided you can afford the 20 ranks in the skill to qualify for the feat - and you'd likely have about +8 vs. spells by then? - would you consider 1 feat for another +2 a good return on investment? If it were +2 to saves, period, clearly it would be an excellent feat. Perhaps I'm looking for an answer to \"How much do you value <strong>Saves</strong>\u00a0vs. <strong>Saves vs. Spells</strong>?\"<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks, fellaws,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n -JimDandy<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">The reason not many take this feat is simple in my opinion,<br/>\n<br/>\n In the builds that have many spare feats (fighter and/or CoT included inside the build) these builds already have good saves, and when there are not many feats available one must prioritize first the Great Attribute feats in order to rise the AB/ AC.<br/>\n<br/>\n It is totaly worth it to stack it on a Dwarf however, they already get +2 to all saves Vs spells so this further help them get good saves.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
