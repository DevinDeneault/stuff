Knockdown's I can see as a potential way of dying but it isn't high enough to prevent a serious improved knockdown attempt from a fighter so knockdown immunity items would be very useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of Domains, Animal would be the most useful for empowered summons from scrolls or wands given you are a ranged character. The other Domain is up for debate, good ones include Trickery, Healing or War. If one wishes to take this one on WoG one should probably choose Plant.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nDealing with the AB issue with either build is of interest to me. Using equipment or UMD spells would be the approach I would be looking at<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect that the high spell resistance aspect of both builds means that scrolls of divine power that are used in combat will not be dispelled? Likewise scrolls of PnP Tensors as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf sequencers are available such scrolls can be put into them.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI think WebShaman\u00a0or Ten Pura might have some answers for that given their experience with high ISR builds.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall I thought the halfling one looked the best out of the two.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The defenses in the order they are checked are spell level absorption (mantles), spell immunity, then spell resistance. That is, a spell that does not check spell resistance is not affected by any of these defenses. </div></blockquote>\n\nThough it says under Dispel Magic <blockquote><div><em>dispel magic</em> does not check spell resistance. </div></blockquote>\n\nSo go figure.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe great thing is the build can go Fists whenever it needs to.\u00a0 It might even be a better Fister (hehe...) than Xbow user!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks Web for your insights here, it looks like sadly everything can be dispelled and I take it that was your experience. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne strategy against AI at least is to bait out all the dispels with a few lightly buffed low level summon creatures, or light buffs of your own from potions of barkskin or ironguts etc whatever you can get, build up enough cheap stuff the AI hates it and will try to get rid of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for pointing out I could swap EWF for ISR for a further +2 SR creating room for an additional rogue level plus retaining spell immunity. The current drafts finish on 66. One could take fighter 2 for free EWF and EP for +3 AB and retain SR 67.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess to answer your question Stag - the AB is terrible on these builds. Sadly one of the trade offs of spell immunity (Or near immunity). Getting AB boosts from cleric DP scrolls or UMD is attractive to pump it up to hit more however the down side is dispellability which may or may not be a problem depending on the environment<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

With 67 SR, it is immune to most offensive spells. The general strategy for this build is to fire sling bullets and run around. If you can get your hands on breach scrolls or a wand of Lesser Spell Breach, that's even better.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, it has HiPS.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the build that I don't want to face as a caster.\u00a0 My general strategy for countering this as a caster is Wand of Expeditious Retreat -&gt; Wand of Improved Invisibility -&gt; Run away!<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditional notes: when playing a caster, I usually don't build to overcome SR 36+. If I will hit SR 35 100%, I'm very comfortable stopping there and seeking to mitigate other weaknesses in the build (like discipline, AC, HP, et al). This means that the above build is overkill for most casters and leaves a fair amount on the table for swapping out Improved Spell Resistance feats with something more offensive in epic levels. I'm putting together a one-room module to test spell effectiveness against a SR 70 Monk, just to see what works.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That said, it's only a DC 25 with 38 Int and no SF: Conj feats, which means the Monk in question must roll a 1 on the Reflex save. Grease is only effective if stacked, then the Monk must save vs. each spell per round.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat Thunderclap is much more effective, because it forces 3 saves as a level 7 spell, but it's only instant, and the negative effects (except deafened, which doesn't do much except to sorcerers/wizards) only last 1 round. On my test Wizard with 38 Int and GSF: Evocation, Great Thunderclap hit for DC 35, which on most of these builds gives me around a 50% chance for one of 1 round stun (will) or a knockdown (reflex) and a 5% (roll 1 on the save) chance on the other depending on whether the build improved Wisdom or Dexterity.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I use Expeditious Retreat because in the environment I play, caster levels are correctly counted when crafting wands, so my Expeditious Retreat lasts over 20 rounds.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
