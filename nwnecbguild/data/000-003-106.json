I imagine that, somewhere amongst the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/other/epic-character-builders\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">3,000+ old epic character builds</a> that there's something like this. The disarm feat was a throwaway and is now Great Fortitude instead, and the feat progression's a little more polished.<br/>\n<br/>\n With regards to skills: Discipline 43, Tumble 40 and Lore 8 are a must have. With regards to Spellcraft, Taunt and UMD:\u00a0<strong>This will depend on the conditions</strong><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>\u00a0of the module. </strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n If there is spell immunity gear available [which there was where this character was created, there was also an additional spellcheck for scroll use for bards of 20 + scroll level hence the 27 spellcraft originally], it may not be worth maxing this out.<br/>\n<br/>\n If there are high level magic items requiring UMD over 15 [like there were where this character was originally created], it may be worth shifting some taunt points into this skill.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Having a taunt above\u00a020 may be handy for high AC opponents with Low Concentration. Again, this can be juggled with spellcraft and UMD depending on the conditions of the module.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>But!</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n For the best all round combination for the everyman, then probably 42 Spellcraft, and some combination of UMD above 10 for scroll use, and Taunt for whatever's left, should be sufficient.</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

And there are a few others listed as well, though many seem a tad misdirected.<br/>\n<br/>\n Ummm... I noticed your Spellcraft has not been maxed/optimized.\u00a0 Or Taunt. You do realize that a bard dump at 40 can reach a modified 45 for +9 vs spells, right?\u00a0 All that is needed to cast all scrolls without failure is a net UMD 10.\u00a0 That's how the hardcore scroll check works for bard's UMD only. The rest of the skill investment you've allocated is just to equip/use expensive class-specific gear and that is an environment-specific choice rather than a power-optimized one.\u00a0 I'd use the excess to max both Spellcraft (actually, 42 ranks is enough to reach 45 with INT 16) and Taunt...\u00a0 since we are focusing on a \"power\" build, eh?\u00a0 The half-orc choice means it will be Taunt bait (no Conc) but at least be equally empowered to even the roll a bit better against those types.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>edit: typos galore. when will it ever end?</em></div></div>"

A scimi can only spam-exploit tiny weapon-wielders (like a kukrimaster, for example) which are few.\u00a0 This build would need to provide an alternate large weapon focus, which is certainly within the realm of possibility with Ftr 28 but not currently part of the build.</div></div>"
