      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hello all.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've noticed a fair few AA builds popping up atm, and having just tidied up my downloads folder came upon this one. It was sent to me by Hip while I was doing his grunt work on version 2 of the Guild Build Filter, so I cannot (and wouldn't wish to) take any credit for it. Nor do I know whether Hip would want this published or not - but he's not here, so parp. I can only hope he forgives me. This one makes no pretence to defence - thunderstruck all the way. Anyhow, I hope it adds to the canon of thought on the class. Alas, the skill points weren't allocated.Everything below is in Hip's words, only slightly edited to protect the guilty. Hope you like it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Here is an AA version I have used many times to dominate in even the highest magic environments for solo or party. It is pure artillery fire power...<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Ultra AB AA</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nCleric 12/ Wizard 1/ AA 27 Elf<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR 9<br/>\nDEX 19 (38)<br/>\nCON 8<br/>\nWIS 16<br/>\nINT 12<br/>\nCHA 8<br/>\n<br/>\n1.

C7<br/>\n8. C8 DEX+1 (21)<br/>\n9. W1 Point Blank Shot<br/>\n10. AA1<br/>\n11. AA2<br/>\n12. AA3 DEX+1 (22) / Called Shot (or Blind Fight)<br/>\n13. AA4<br/>\n14. AA5<br/>\n15. AA6 Rapid Shot<br/>\n16. AA7 DEX+1 (23)<br/>\n17. AA8<br/>\n18. AA9 Improved Critical: Longbow<br/>\n19. AA10<br/>\n20. C9 DEX+1 (24)<br/>\n21. C10 Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow<br/>\n22. C11<br/>\n23. C12<br/>\n24. AA11 DEX+1 / Great Dex I (26)<br/>\n25. AA12<br/>\n26. AA13<br/>\n27. AA14 Great Dex II / Great Dex III (28)<br/>\n28. AA15 DEX+1 (29)<br/>\n29. AA16<br/>\n30. AA17 Great Dex IV (30)<br/>\n31. AA18 Great Dex V (31)<br/>\n32. AA19 DEX+1 (32)<br/>\n33. AA20 Great Dex VI (33)<br/>\n34. AA21<br/>\n35. AA22 Great Dex VII (34)<br/>\n36. AA23 DEX+1 / Great Dex VIII (36)<br/>\n37. AA24<br/>\n38. AA25<br/>\n39. AA26 Great Dex IX (37) / Epic Prowess<br/>\n40. AA27 DEX+1 (38)<br/>\n<br/>\nHPs: 276 + 120 emp/endure = 396<br/>\nSaves: (F/W/R) 22/24/34 (27/29/39 vs spells) +2 vs mind effects<br/>\nBAB: 26<br/>\nAB: max 26 (melee) 58 (ranged)<br/>\nAC: (naked/mundane armour + shield) 28/31<br/>\nSkills: 183. Hide 43 (57), Listen 33 (38), Move Silently 43 (57), Spellcraft 24 (25), Tumble 20 (34)<br/>\n<br/>\n...I'm only furnishing an example of the attack ceiling for this build because the AB potential seems to impress you the most. Damage per round is equally impressive with all the divine buffs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAB Buffs:<br/>\n58+1bless+4divine favour+1aid+1prayer+4divine power+2battle tide+3 emp cats = 74.<br/>\n<br/>\nNotice that I do not include True Strike...because, in practice, it wastes APR and 74 AB will hit an AC of 84 about 50% of the time. Should be plenty in all but the highest magic environments but in those cases +20 weapons abound anyway, making True Strike's boost redundant.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn theory though, an AB of 58 + 20 TS +3 emp cats = 81 is reachable for those lame 9-second intervals. But exactly who is going waltzing around with over 90 AC? Maybe a act boss. Nothing else.<br/>\n<br/>\nI prefer to use the limited Wizard 1 slot(s) for Mage Armour in most situations, even though it is easily dispelled.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn high magic servers, expensive ammo may make Blind Fight more useful than Called Leg shots because I use those crit-immune huge elementals (or other summon scrolls) to tank while my toon snipes over their shoulder. Missing attack attempts vs all those concealed types like shadows can become somewhat costly...In environments that provide access to permahaste items, I will usually defer to Trickery domain instead for the concealment advantage, but being able to add haste to summons is really hard to discard...<br/>\n<br/>\n...The only real threat against an artillery AA are mobs of ranged attackers. A single cast of Darkness over the mob negates their threat because the AI will force them to advance towards the AA trying to escape the shroud of blindness and in so doing become easy targets as well as them wasting counterattack opportunities during the movement.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only downside to the build is that with all the AA levels, it is impossible to exploit the Divine Power progression. One could conceivably use Cleric 16/ Wizard 1/ AA 23 to accomplish that goal but the final AB would be significantly lower along with the DR penetration. Besides, at Wisdom around 16, slots for DP are somewhat limited so it is good to know that when the buffs have been exhausted, the toon can still dominate with its intrinsic combat prowess and APR.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd there you have it. I wasn't quite sure where to post this, but thought it deserved some air.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
