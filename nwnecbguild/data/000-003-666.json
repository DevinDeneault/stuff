      "content": "<div><strong>The 2 hp / level Mage</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nI read in the WoG forums some years ago a player called Papa Lenin got a 2/hp per level elf sorceress to level 40 solo PvM in that challenging environment<br/>\nInterestingly he wrote it was easier to level and play than his pure fighter (tragic for those of us who love our combat builds)<br/>\n<br/>\nHere I attempt to make a build draft which is playable and even enjoyable solo PvM.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is really designed for PvM parties. Its a complete meme the low HP mage, here I take it to extremes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut to make it work solo PvM I try to incorporate a few strategies:<br/>\n- trapping skills (crafting, setting, retrieving) to help deal with challenging encounters<br/>\n- summons and dominate spells (enchantment) to turn low will opponents into tanks for the mage<br/>\n- heal skill not for the caster, but to heal summons and dominated monsters<br/>\n- empower spell for empowered endurance (of course) enroute to stoneskin/greater stoneskin/premonition<br/>\n- craft wand for lots of damaging spells, rebuffs, craft weapon to make bone wands from your environment\u00a0<br/>\n- epic mage armor / epic warding later on to help with survivability<br/>\n<br/>\nI figured the things that are going to kill you are:<br/>\n- ranged opponents<br/>\n- traps<br/>\n- enemy mages<br/>\n- sneakers and invisible enemies<br/>\n- bosses who will tear through your summons / tanks<br/>\n<br/>\nThe low HP in the build could also be viewed as a challenge to play well as a wizard strategically which I find interesting<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I thought I would share this thought provoking concept with you, not quite up to Mick Dagger's <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-epic-scholar-bard-1-wizard-39-t2326949.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Scholar's</a> level, but part way there.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Wizard(40), Elf\nSTR: 12\nCON: 6\nINT: 18 (38)\n\n01: Wizard(1): Extend Spell, {Scribe Scroll}\n03: Wizard(3): Spell Focus: Evocation\n05: Wizard(5): Craft Wand\n07: Wizard(7)\n09: Wizard(9): Spell Focus: Enchantment\n11: Wizard(11)\n13: Wizard(13)\n15: Wizard(15): Spell Focus: Necromancy, Maximize Spell\n17: Wizard(17)\n19: Wizard(19)\n21: Wizard(21): Great Intelligence I, (INT=24)\n23: Wizard(23): Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor\n25: Wizard(25)\n27: Wizard(27): Great Intelligence III, (INT=27)\n29: Wizard(29): Great Intelligence IV, (INT=29)\n31: Wizard(31)\n33: Wizard(33): Great Intelligence VI, (INT=32)\n35: Wizard(35): Great Intelligence VII, (INT=33)\n37: Wizard(37)\n39: Wizard(39): Great Intelligence X, (INT=37)\n\nSkillpoints: 389\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +11, Mind Effects: +2\nAB (max, naked): 21 (melee), 24 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Wizard(9)\nAlignment Changes: 0\nAppraise 4(18), Concentration 43(41), Craft Trap 11(25), Craft Weapon 2(16), Disable Trap 21(37), Heal 43(42), Listen 21(22), Lore 11(25), Open Lock 1(5), Search 21(37), Set Trap 9(15), Spellcraft 43(57), Spot 21(22), Tumble 20(24)\n\n02: Concentration(1), Craft Trap(1), Lore(1), Spot(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n04: Concentration(1), Craft Trap(1), Lore(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n06: Concentration(1), Craft Trap(1), Lore(1), Save(9),\u00a0\n08: Concentration(1), Craft Trap(1), Lore(1), Search(2),\u00a0\n10: Concentration(1), Heal(6),\u00a0\n12: Concentration(1), Heal(3), Search(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n14: Concentration(1), Set Trap(2), Save(5),\u00a0\n16: Concentration(1), Save(12),\u00a0\n18: Concentration(1), Set Trap(3), Save(8),\u00a0\n20: Concentration(1), Disable Trap(2), Set Trap(1), Save(10),\u00a0\n22: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Save(21),\u00a0\n24: Concentration(1), Heal(8),\u00a0\n26: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Search(2), Save(4),\u00a0\n28: Concentration(1), Heal(4), Search(3),\u00a0\n30: Concentration(1), Disable Trap(5), Heal(1),\u00a0\n32: Concentration(1), Disable Trap(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(8),\u00a0\n34: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Listen(5), Save(1),\u00a0\n36: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Listen(4), Save(4),\u00a0\n38: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Listen(6),\u00a0\n40: Appraise(3), Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(9),\u00a0\n</details></div>"

      "content": "<div>I've fought against an 80 HP Wiz40 on a PvP server before, as long as you know your opponent's weak points it's just like any other DC mage. The player who used it said that the only real difference is you have less room for mistakes. It's definitely not the sort of build you play in a new environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nWiz39/Sorc1 lets you move a pre-epic Wiz feat into epic levels, but losing even 1 caster level will make a big difference for this build so it's probably not worth it. Everything else looks good, although in some environments it might be worth swapping a focus for ESPen since if your spells don't land you die.</div>"

      "content": "<div>I like the SD suggestions Zanithar, its not a bad idea one can drop some spell foci for for dodge and mobility<br/>\nThat being said it ruins the 2hp/lvl concept by having d8 hit die<br/>\nIt can't be used, Yunim has the right of it here, it can only be a 2hp/lvl mage with d4 hit die classes being Wizard or Sorc only<br/>\nAnother 2hp/lvl mage I considered was a Sorc 39 / Wizard 1 build, Wizard 1 for scribe scroll.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nYunim I've playtested this one to level 3 so far.\u00a0<br/>\nGreat to hear your experience in PvP against a lvl 40 80hp mage.\u00a0<br/>\nBy that stage the character is much more developed and has empowered endurance and other defensive spells.\u00a0<br/>\nI can see how your friend described it as being \"less room for mistakes\" playing it at level 40.<br/>\nIn contrast in a PvM environment, playing the character properly from low levels is more like walking a tightrope across a 200 story skyscraper, particularly against archers and the like, or a crowded room full of meleers. They simply have to hit you and you are down, unless you have endurance up.<br/>\nIn that respect is an excellent tool from a learning perspective to minimise receiving any damage at all.</div>"
