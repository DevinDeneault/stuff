But a caster/battle/charisma cleric is weaker than the sum of its parts, not greater.  Even the Domains are unfocused.  For a build like this, you should have Travel &gt; War/Plant/Trickery &gt; Strength &gt; everything else.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThis cleric is super stat starved, mechanically the best Domains would be Travel/War allowing you to focus on capping Wis and Charisma. On worlds with haste items, War and Plant/Trickery/Strength would be the best.<br/>\n<br/>\nHealing is a poor choice for this build, strength is not bad given you will not have 7/8/9th level spells on a deep cleric build until you are well into epics and you have some Charisma.  That said, very few once per day feats are worth building for., but yay more divine power.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as doing it all, this is close to the best you can do.  I would take an early +1 Wisdom in stat gains, swap armor skin into a cleric bonus feat and drop whatever stat gain you replaced into the current armour skin slot.  Netting you 7th level spells earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also, recommend deciding what type of cleric you want and focus your build in that direction.  A battle charisma/divine cleric is admittedly the more complicated of the 3.  The reason people use CoT is to remove the 4th stat dependency (Charisma) from the equation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It's an awful word to label a build within a few moments of reading it,\u00a0<br/>\nI prefer to use the word <strong>exciting</strong>. This build attempts to challenge an extremely old and crusty build concept, the Cleric/CoT/Rogue power build.<br/>\nCan we build on this and do even better? Already the caster levels are better, and the saves *might* be better as well!<br/>\n<br/>\nI presume when you used that term you are looking at single elements expecting a super powerful specialist (ie <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/boccob-s-tricky-devastator-cleric-32-fighter-6-rog-t2355328.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hyperpowered Dev Critter</a>, <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/demolition-man-cleric-38-monk-1-rogue-1-t515420.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hyperpowered Zen Archer/implosion Cleric</a>) which this build is not.<br/>\nThis is more of a fabulous generalist. When you view it from this perspective it is far more enjoyable than the other two I have linked.<br/>\nAnd of course compared with a paladin it seems hardly mediocre with a full 9th cleric spellbook with caster level 35, any AB lost from a lower BAB + Str stat is made up from\u00a0Cleric being able +20 AB cap easily (ie. DP 5 GMW 5 DF 5 Bless 1 Aid 1 Prayer 1 +18 AB without trying), base melee 37 AB will be close to 63 in reality including Str bonuses<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth Boccob's Devastator and Demolition Man have average fortitude and terrible reflex saves and 20-25% less HP saves wise this guy beats them by 4-8 points which is 1.5 a save item like an Ring of Fortitude +4, even more considering CHA can be buffed further, this cleric can frontline much more effectively than those two offensively focused builds, in a challenging environment this is valuable<br/>\nIn terms of tankability add Empowered Endurance / Eagle's Splendor and a few items the saves are going to be fabulous combined with so much HP (likely around 500-600 with empowered Endurance) and evasion<br/>\nI felt I had to put divine might in the build otherwise it didn't seem to be a proper paladin, although I could drop it for Silent and Maximize<br/>\nIf I bring this guy to a PvM party I am going to worry less about him dying than the other two builds who pack a punch<br/>\n<br/>\nRE domains I chose Strength/Healing because it seemed the best of a bad bunch for lawful good humans on the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/deity/search.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Deity search</a>, I could have gone Animal + Plant of course, but one gets bored of seeing Animal + Plant clerics all the time. In other environments your suggestions are very reasonable. I like healing teammates by the way, wanted to give that domain a go for free empowered healing.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I forgot to do because it was late and I was tired was to link other Cleric 30+ / Paladin / (Rogue) builds I could find, I did read a few (except Valerfor's - forgot to search DPA's engine) before posting:<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>ECB Archives</em><br/>\nBuilds with 30 to 40 levels of cleric, 1 to 40 levels of paladin, and 0 to 40 levels of any class.<br/>\nAll races are included.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Fair enough, mediocre was not the correct word to use.  Perhaps in conversation with appropriate tone but it is not appropriate in hindsight using toneless text.  My apologies, any cleric build that is 24+ levels will not be a mediocre unless you skip the prerequisite wisdom. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow on to the logic puzzle.  In the spectrum of cleric builds it struggles to offer a general solution.  It has a solid AB, absolutely, but in the quest to capitalise on all a cleric has to offer it has a large number of issues to mitigate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis build will work, it meets the criteria.  It just tries to do to many things and the underpinnings to make it all work well are not there.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will struggle in most modules to cap all the stats you need.  Meaning your AB suffers or your saves/divine feat duration suffer or your spell slots suffer or your HP suffer, likely more than 1.  One mitigation for this is to have the War Domain, which you do not have, another is Paladin spells, a third I can think of is Blackguard Bull\u2019s Strength.  It is unlikely you can cap all the stats you need and if you do, I cannot help but wonder if you stripped way the Paladin saves synergy and added targeted saves whether or not you could hit the same save level.  It is unlikely on most modules that you would hit both the stat caps AND the save caps so the Paladin save synergy of not applying to the save caps is unlikely to be in play here.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour divine might takes 2 feats and an investment in charisma (which synergizes with your saves) and lasts 9 rounds, assuming you can cap Charisma (assuming base 16 is correct), which in turn impacts likely several other things you need capped.  Mitigation for this is to increase your Charisma and cap it which decreases your Strength and makes you choose which of your other stats will miss being capped.  This path is missing the 3rd feat (Divine Shield), not the end of the world, but nit capitalising on all the synergy has to offer.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have deep caster level which offers some serious power if you are an offensive caster or can use extended Aura of Vitality, Haste, Regen, Battletide with a side of Prayer.  The most powerful of these spells are unavailable in your spell lineup due to Domain limitations and you will also be limited to DCless spells because you did not invest in Wisdom.  Many of your powerful spells will also arrive quite late in your build.  A cleric has some decent spells that work, like harm, but you leave a lot of clerical spell power on the table for such a large investment.  It does still offer solid dispel resistance and nets several extra feats (used for wisdom to cast higher level spells) but lacks the other synergies.  The dispel resistance is excellent but Breach is still going to hurt.  Also, until that breach hits your Spell Resistance spell, you are going to have some solid spell mitigation in place :)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou invest heavily in Strength which makes for an excellent strength battle cleric especially once you add divine might to the equation but it has a heavy reliance on so many low duration spells/feats to keep the engine moving well.  It is hard to juggle hitting stuff with keeping all those spells and feats chugging along.  This is no different than any other battle cleric.  You will have an advantage for some cleric spells but a disadvantage on Divine Might.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn each case, going half way down the path stunts a lot of the what each path offers and having all paths does not balance out what focusing in one or two of them would offer.  I am not even talking powergaming here, justoverlapping a few of the synergies better/at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing a cleric however plugs enough of the holes that it will work, but you will struggle to meet everything you need.<br/>\n<br/>\nPick your focus(es) and strip out a stunted path or two and see the synergies shine.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrop divine might and add War for example (perhaps BG over Paladin).<br/>\n<br/>\nTrim some cleric levels and bump Paladin for some hit points, paladin abilities.  Make use of that extend feat across some Paladin spells.  For example 14 Paladin nets 14 round holy sword, 56 minute  extended bless weapon and helps mitigate your stat capping issue with Aura of Glory.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrop Paladin, go BG and review Domain options with War and Strength perhaps.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

This allows me to drop power attack / divine might, and take silent spell and maximize (or scribe scroll / luck of heroes / great fortitude / toughness) instead. I can drop the two +cha increases for two wisdom increases, getting the level 7-8-9 spells sooner. Spellcasting is therefore better whilst retaining good saves from the CHA and just forgetting about going for DM.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll end the suggestions into the main post, thanks for the suggestions<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually am unsure how maximize applies to clerics by the way, I hear about maximize blade barriers for example, maximized healing (with healing domain) combines both empowered healing and maximize according to the Wiki, which is interesting, it might not necessarily be the best reason to take the feat, and perhaps extra saves / HP might be better anyway<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I think deep CL on a battle cleric is very interesting, Spell Resistance (the Spell) is 12+CL which on a 35 CL cleric is 47.  This alone is powerful, add to that 70 Round near undispellable Haste/BattleTide/Regen/AoV/Divine Power/Prayer with a splash of Divine Favor is pretty awesome.  Now add 70 round silence to this and perhaps silent Harm/Blade Barriers and you are cooking.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Heal Domain would be powerful IF the empower acted on Heal, sadly in the uncustomized NWN toolset, it does not.  I suspect because, like Harm, neither spell gained benefit from Empower/Maximize under the original spell definition.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I tend not to Empower/Maximize mine as it is effective without it, if it hits at all and my level 8/9 spell slots are busy with other things, extra so on a battle cleric which doubles down on their lack of spell slots.  I do consider Empower/Maximize on stuff with high DR.  That all said, I tend not to take Maximize, it is pretty niche on a cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
