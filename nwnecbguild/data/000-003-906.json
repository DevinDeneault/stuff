      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hello all, I am looking for a 40 elf fighter wizard and PM build with preference of using a bastard sword. Additionally the build needs to have at least 2 levels of wizard and 3 levels of fighter early so I can use an item specialized for something called the bladecastor blade which is a bastardsword. I tried to copy a finished lvl 40 human PM build in epic builds but it did not pan out as much as I'd liked it to as an elf. Additionally id like to Max out pm as much as possible to try and get 30 levels in PM. Is this doable or even viable to be an effective tankyish dpsish elf character capable of using bastardsword and board? Thank you very much. Dev crit is not a must and I'd like to at least have a higher crit chance. Additionally I'd like a nice mix of str and the ability to have still spell for casting damage shields and a slightly higher AB.<br/>\n<br/>\nV/r<br/>\nGreedy<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
