Perhaps with better AB? Not sure. I play in a server that is based on warzones. So, I love tanking always have. Just making sure if I can do better than the build I already have? Toss me whatever builds you can please! :D I am seeking a strong tank to survive in war PvP! Thank you all!</div>"

My build is the heavy armor/longsword/shield build of 2bard/28 fight/10 RDD. I saw someone saying if you want a decent tank that has good offense and defense. Ranger RDD Bard? I have no clue how to build that, however. Thank you!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Mages, there's not much you can do about.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the question is what can you do about high damage critters? I presume you are looking at Str-based WMs here - do you have any idea of their AB (and AC)? If the AB was the same as yours the first attack has a 75% hit chance, then it would be 50%, 25% and the rest at 5%, although they would get another 75% attack with Haste. Depending on the weapon they will crit a fair bit with those numbers. Any AC you can get is going to help, but you really want a fair bit more. 5 more AC would reduce the crits by about half. BTW does that AC include Bard Song (or the effects of Curse Song, reducing their AB).</div>"
