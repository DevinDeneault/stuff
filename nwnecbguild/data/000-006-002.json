      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hello All.<br/>\n<br/>\nI present the Firewing of Corellon Larethian to you. To her elven patron she owes her song and love of the arts. To her draconic heritage she owes her might. I hope you like her.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe started off in the Build Request forum in the thread, \"Whistle While You Work\", which gives her background and my thinking in her construction, and she's now fit for members' consumption. I have made a few amendments/fixes. The amendments include taking an option I suggested as a possible tweak, in that she now focuses on longsword early and the greatsword for a more deadly presence later (though sword and board can still be used if required). My sums had also mucked up the skill points I had available, which I've now fixed. I also did find another build with the same classes and distribution in the Legacy Archive: <strong>Cati the Holy Edge</strong> by Sam Elanius in 2008. However, that build is human, takes Dev Crit much later and takes only 4 Great Strengths, finishing on Strength 38. I believe Firewing surpasses that, while retaining her elven grace.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith no further ado...<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Firewing of Corellon</strong></span><br/>\nBard 8/ RDD 10/ Champion of Corellon 22<br/>\nElf.

It has the same class split, but takes a very different focus getting a high CHA - thus the \"smiting\" element - and is human. It's a great example of how the same classes (even with the same levels) can be used in contrasting ways.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT 3:</strong></em> Further apologies - and more importantly, credit - this time to Tyr Templar, for missing her\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/dragon-slayer-sword-bard8-rdd10-cot22-t2294858.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dragon Slayer - Sword</a> build, which is much closer to Firewing than Valerfor's in its execution, and considerably pre-dates her. I can only assume I was having a bad search day: there was certainly no intention to plagiarize. What is especially galling is that this is the build I have been most proud of. I hope Tyr Templar can forgive me.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

She actually began as only focusing in Longsword, with Toughness replacing the focus in Greatsword, but conceptually, she was all about power, and that 1.5 damage inflicted by the Greatsword (or any two-hander of your choice, but GS has a better chance of critting) was worth the loss of 40 hps in my book, as the fights shouldn't last as long. Sword and board remains a viable option - and still has an AB of 44, which is not too shabby - it just won't hurt as much.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfraid CoT doesn't get free Heavy Armour, just Light and Medium. Defensively, you're right, the Expertise twins would help, but I'm loath to drop Strength - as you can tell by my postponing EWF to level 31 so I can get all possible Great Strengths. Essentially, it's about a trade-off. If you want to trade 1AB for 1AC, that's fine. Equally, if you want to sacrifice IKD for Expertise, that's fine too. Feel free to tweak and adjust to your own tastes!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again. Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

What Bard mainly brings here is access to RDD, Tumble and UMD, along with the song (which isn't massive, but it helps and is undispellable). The meat and potatoes here is the raw power and excellent saves. After all, every feat taken is a combat one. I know it doesn't look that way to start with, but you should start to notice the difference after a few levels of RDD, and she'll really start to flower around her mid teens.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally pleased you're giving her a run, sataricon!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Okay. Bard gives hps of d6 + Con modifier (currently 1) per level. CoT gives d10 + Con mod. RDD is somewhat different, in that it gives d6 + Con mod for the first 3 levels, d8 + Con mod at levels 4 and 5, and d10 + Con mod from levels 6 -10 (d12 + Con mod from 11 onwards, but that doesn't concern us here). The reason I don't specify the constitution modifier here is because when you hit RDD 7 you get a +2 boost to Con, so from level 19 onwards that modifier becomes 2 rather than 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, simply put, you get 7 hps p/level from levels 1-8 (so 56 is spot on), 9 hps at levels 9 and 10, 11 from level 11-16, another 7 at level 17, 11 at 18, and 12 from 19 onwards, except at 27 and 37 when it's 8.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps rather than confuses!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Ninja'd by Empyre, but I'll let it stand. Actually, I can't remember atm (sorry, just woken up) if the Con boost at RDD 7 is back-dated like Toughness is?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT 2:</em></strong> Have just checked on the wiki, and the boost to Con is indeed retroactive, so you'll also get a further 18 hps when you hit RDD7 at level 19 (thus 30 hps\u00a0 in total at that level).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Remember to sing, use things like tanglefoot bags and UMD bits and bobs, keep your AC as high as you can, and don't just charge in for the moment (remember to take a ranged weapon along as well, very helpful for pulling enemies) - that will come soon enough.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks, Valerfor.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as an addendum, while it might seem a nice idea to go for longbow, it needs to be a focus in a melee weapon (which is also why Monk/ CoTs need to take WF: kama even if they're going to specialize in fist, 'cause unarmed fighting doesn't count either). It's a problem that could be addressed by going for Fighter instead of CoT, but then - as an elf - you crash headlong into experience points penalties (with Wizard - albeit bizarrely - being the preferred class for elves), which can make a huge difference in module play (less so in PWs).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I've said before, it just means exercising a little more caution until you start taking levels in CoT. But at least you'll have a shield through those early levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hey Stag!<br/>\n<br/>\nSince you pointed me in this direction, I thought I'd leave you my 2 cents:<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, kudos. This is a VERY strong build, and what I like the most about it is the slickness of going Elf to circumvent the need to take Weapon Focus on a crappy weapon. That said, it's all about where you play. This build doesn't really need to wield a 2-hander, and IMO it loses more than it gains, because the 1.5x damage will only be an issue when you don't crit, which is NOT going to be often. And in those cases, it may be better just to have a higher AC.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in order to have options to fight with a higher or lower AC as desired / necessary, as well as improve the level 40 power of the build, I'd do the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- Drop Heavy Armor Proficiency. You'll get it through CoT anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n2- Drop WF: Greatsword. Transfer all your feats to your Longsword and carry a 2-hander (preferably a Heavy Flail, since Undead reduce slashing and piercing damage and Bludgeoning resistance is harder to come by) without focus in case you'd like to make the switch. I'm not saying you shouldn't use 2-handers, I'm saying you don't need the feat investment.<br/>\n<br/>\n3- With the 2 feats, take Luck of Heroes to further improve your 3 saves, or Great Fortitude in case you're going to face DevCritting monsters or PCs. They will surely go down first in a battle of DevCritters. Then take Expertise with the second feat to make your AC more malleable. (regardless, unless you go for LoH, Expertise is probably best at level 1 to help compensate for the lack of Heavy Armor those first few levels).<br/>\n<br/>\n4- Drop Spot and/or Spellcraft for Taunt to make use of the Taunt / Expertise combo. That makes both your AC and AB malleable. You need AC, fight in Expertise for +5 AC. Need AB, fight in Expertise, then Taunt, then drop Expertise and gain up to +6 AB. Need AB and AC, Fight in Expertise, Taunt, re-activate Expertise and you'll have +1 AB and +5 AC.<br/>\n<br/>\n5- I'd delay Devcrit a bit for a few extra skill points by taking RDD 9 ASAP. Since skill points aren't retroactive, the sooner you take them the better.<br/>\n<br/>\n6- I'd go Bard 6 / CoT 6 / RDD 8 pre-epic so I could get RDD 9 as early as level 21, to maximize those skill points. That would only delay Devcrit by 2 levels. You'd have it by level 25. If you're planning to play this build all the way to 40th level, then it's no big loss. In MTS, you'll have it before the end of Act 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, IMO this is a VERY GOOD build, so I don't see any shortcomings that are not able to be overcome by smart in-game decision-making. This means I wouldn't weaken the end result just to make it easier to play for a couple of levels. But, as you know, that's my style of building.

If you take Bard 6 at level 13 you get your 15 UMD, and you delay the CoT bonus feats by 1 level each pre-epic. You also have a 14 level gap until your next Tumble dump (+3AC rather than +2), so it's up to you.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this is the sort of thing you were looking for!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
