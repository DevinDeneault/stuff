And i won't lie about the weaknesses of this particular build either, as many of you will find the hp's lacking for a melee character and the saves aren't so good. Thankfully the bad news stop here and for these small sacrifices you can have the best killer you can find for your money. Have you ever wondered what would happen if you could have a Barbarian that his rage would cause his foes to run in terror from him while he is chopping them down with his Greatsword, delivering Devastating hits with brutal efficiency due to the multiple stacking of EWS/ Crippling Strike &amp; 8 dice of Sneak Attack, all the while he is holding a large weapon with 32 natural Strength? Well time to find out and this is just the beginning, cause this Cat can also find, disable &amp; set all (except gas) deadly traps there is as well, not to mention Hide/ Move Silently, use any magic items under the sun, Taunt his opponents to lower their AC and force them to their knees with his IKD strikes. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere you go,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"font-size:150%;line-height:normal\">LORD OF THE HUNT</span></strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>(BARB 16/ FTR 8/ ROG 16)</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n RACE: Human<br/>\n<br/>\n ALIGNMENT: Chaotic Neutral<br/>\n<br/>\n PLAYABILITY: PvM 1-40<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>STARTING/ ENDING STATS</strong>:<br/>\n STR  - 18  (<strong>32</strong>)<br/>\n DEX - 10<br/>\n CON - 14<br/>\n INT   - 14<br/>\n WIS  - 08<br/>\n CHA - 08<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong> BASIC STATS</strong>:<br/>\n<br/>\n Hit Points: 448<br/>\n<br/>\n Skill Points: 361<br/>\n<br/>\n Discipline: 43 (54)<br/>\n Disable Traps: 16 (20)<br/>\n Hide: 33 (33)<br/>\n Intimidate: 43 (52)<br/>\n Move Silently: 30 (30)<br/>\n Open Locks: 10 (10)<br/>\n Search: 18 (20)<br/>\n Set Traps: 13 (15)<br/>\n Taunt: 43 (42)<br/>\n Tumble: 40 (40)<br/>\n Spellcraft: 18 (20)<br/>\n UMD: 36 (35)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fort/Ref/Will):  22/ 20/ 15  \u2192  26/ 24/ 19  (<strong>Improved Evasion</strong>)<br/>\n<br/>\n Naked/ Armoured AC: 20/ 31  (Full plate &amp; T.

Another choice i made was with the skill set but feel free to adjust to your needs, cause i went Human also for the reason to have an extreme amount of skills. This character has been set in a way to make use of Epic Traps as well if you so desire with only a small investment of a +2 DEX item that of course in game you will have, only thing that you need is simply to adjust your skill set for that.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I still applaud the build because it has so much else going for it. An impoortant factor here is that you can neutralize many creatures with the Terrifying rage, so they never will attack you. But there are limits to who can be stopped by TR, and you have to fight those tougher creatures.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy basic assumption is that in balanced mods where Dev. crit. is allowed, you will also meet creatures with Dev. crit., not only in PvP, but also in PvM play, and then you need a way to handle that threat. Immunity to crits eliminates the threat completely (Pale Master). A high AC, Epic Dodge and Self Concealment reduce the threat significantly. If you don't have those, you have to rely on a fair Fort save bonus. If you are up against a fighter with Dev Crit DC 40 (Character-level 40, Str 30), you must roll 18 to survive a critical hit when your Fort save bonus is 22. Then the Hunter suddenly becomes the prey.<br/>\nOf course you know WoG better than I do, since you have played there a lot. If this isn't a problem there, then of course it isn't relevant there.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You assumed that Dev, Critical able characters will play in worlds that have also Dev. Critical threats, while the opposite is also true. \"Lord of the Hunt\" in his two versions is meant to be played in any world, no matter if they allow Dev. Critical for his foes or not. If he is in a party he will just let his <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/dwarven-warmaster-ftr-8-rogue-10-cot-22-t2350710.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">good</a> <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/the-white-knight-paladin-8-fighter-6-cot-26-t2351403.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">friends</a> tank for him or if he is soloing and with a little forethought he can lay down a deadly or epic even field of traps and lure his foes in that. Then a single stun or delay from a trap is all he needs in order to use his UMD skill and lay down the smack with IGMS scrolls and the like. He has the tools and the means both to deal with those kind of opponents, he won't simply give up. <br/>\n<br/>\nHeh, believe me i always try to rise the saves of my characters but in some cases like this it simply cannot be done without sacrificing some other part that i think it is vital. Replacing for example two Gr. Strength with Gr. fortitude &amp; Epic fortitude will lower my AB to a point that i would not like for this character and he still would need more than enough luck to make his saving throw against Dev. Critical enemies with a simple 40 DC (in WoG for example where it exists, it is higher than that). Rather than try and be simply good at everything i choose for him to be exceptional in his specific field, which is to kill things effectively and to adapt to many situations thanks to his great skill-set, umd &amp; terrifying rage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again for your input, Mick.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
