      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The Chaos Commando is a special forces toon capable of ranged support, hand-to-hand combat, all out assault or espionage and assassination.  It blends the all strengths of the Barbarian, Assassin and Shadowdancer classes to devastating effect.  Using the search engine, only 2 other builds came up:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build213050.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Heart of Darkness</a> (barbarian 16 / shadowdancer 1 / assassin 23) by GDL<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build299000.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Artemis The Raging</a> (barbarian 20 / shadowdancer 10 / assassin 10) by Chidon55<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth are melee builds, with GDL's a strength build and Chidon55's a dexer, but the Chaos Commando is completely different in concept and purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Chaos Commando is primarily a ranged attacker.  I chose the Heavy Crossbow because of its greater crit range and base damage but it can be easily changed to another ranged weapon.  It doesn't have the AB of an AA but it is still respectable at 42 and probably offers a bit more flexibility than your typical AA build.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe primary tactic is to HiPS in and attempt a 7d6 Death Attack.  The Death Attack DC is relatively low at 26 so success will usually only work when the the target rolls a 1 (but the Death Attack is more icing on the cake than anything else).  With groups of mobs, the Chaos Commando then unleashes its Terrifying Rage and with a DC of 52 + 1d10, most mobs will be paralyzed with fear.  In either case, the Chaos Commando can begin picking off these targets at leisure.  You can also Taunt, HiPS away and begin sneak attacking.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the enemy gets in too close, the Chaos Commando can HiPS away or switch to a hand weapon to finish the job.  Weapon Finesse gives the flexibility so make sure to keep a nice weapon close by and a high AC coupled with Epic Dodge and Improved Invisibility ensure a fairly high survival rate.  Taunt and Terrifying Rage can also be triggered to boost the stats while also potentially giving an edge to the encounter.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis level split was specifically chosen:<br/>\nBarbarian 16 - 5 uses of Rage / day, allows Terrifying Rage to be picked earlier (at lvl 24)<br/>\nAssassin 14 - bonus feat needed to get Great Dexterity<br/>\nShadowdancer 10 - needed for Epic Dodge<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the downside, the Chaos Commando has a terrible Will save of 15.  It can get boosted to 18 when raging, and up to 21 if raging and facing spells.  UMD does help to get access to mind-protection scrolls and equipment.  Also, the CON of 14 means rage will only last 11 rounds when active so CON boosting equipment should be high on the list.  Dwarf can work but that means you lose 43 skills points and a feat.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Chaos Commando</strong><br/>\nBarbarian(16), Assassin(14), Shadowdancer(10), Human<br/>\nPlayable 1-40 PvM, PvP untested<br/>\nNeutral or Chaotic Evil only<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 10<br/>\nDEX: 18 (30)<br/>\nCON: 14<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Barbarian(1): Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus: Heavy Crossbow<br/>\n02: Barbarian(2): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br/>\n03: Barbarian(3): Point Blank Shot<br/>\n04: Barbarian(4): DEX+1, (DEX=19)<br/>\n05: Barbarian(5)<br/>\n06: Barbarian(6): Rapid Reload<br/>\n07: Barbarian(7)<br/>\n08: Barbarian(8): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br/>\n09: Barbarian(9): Blind Fight<br/>\n10: Barbarian(10)<br/>\n11: Barbarian(11)<br/>\n12: Barbarian(12): DEX+1, Dodge, (DEX=21)<br/>\n13: Barbarian(13)<br/>\n14: Assassin(1)<br/>\n15: Assassin(2): Mobility<br/>\n16: Assassin(3): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br/>\n17: Assassin(4)<br/>\n18: Shadowdancer(1): Improved Critical: Heavy Crossbow, {Hide in Plain Sight}<br/>\n19: Shadowdancer(2): {Darkvision, Evasion}<br/>\n20: Shadowdancer(3): DEX+1, (DEX=23)<br/>\n21: Barbarian(14): Epic Weapon Focus: Heavy Crossbow<br/>\n22: Shadowdancer(4)<br/>\n23: Shadowdancer(5): {Defensive Roll}<br/>\n24: Barbarian(15): DEX+1, Terrifying Rage, (DEX=24)<br/>\n25: Assassin(5)<br/>\n26: Shadowdancer(6)<br/>\n27: Shadowdancer(7): Epic Prowess, {Slippery Mind}<br/>\n28: Shadowdancer(8): DEX+1, (DEX=25)<br/>\n29: Shadowdancer(9)<br/>\n30: Shadowdancer(10): Epic Dodge, {Improved Evasion}<br/>\n31: Assassin(6)<br/>\n32: Assassin(7): DEX+1, (DEX=26)<br/>\n33: Assassin(8): Armor Skin<br/>\n34: Assassin(9)<br/>\n35: Assassin(10)<br/>\n36: Assassin(11): DEX+1, Epic Skill Focus: Intimidate, (DEX=27)<br/>\n37: Assassin(12)<br/>\n38: Assassin(13)<br/>\n39: Assassin(14): Great Dexterity I, Great Dexterity II, (DEX=29)<br/>\n40: Barbarian(16): DEX+1, (DEX=30)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 436<br/>\nSkillpoints: 321<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 22/15/31<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +3, Traps: +8, Poison: +6<br/>\nBAB: 28<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 39 (melee), 42 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 30/33<br/>\nSpell Casting: <br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nHeal 1(0), Hide 42(52), Intimidate 43(52), Move Silently 42(52), Spellcraft 13(15), Spot 42(41), Taunt 43(42), Tumble 40(50), UMD 26(25)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I've been playing on Kharlindale lately and over there, there are no items or scrolls available that give you Improved Invisibility.  Also, my original build did call for Dwarf and I chose Assassin over Rogue because of the XP penalty.  I'll tinker with the build and see if I can work in Rogue in such a way that fits my concept.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
