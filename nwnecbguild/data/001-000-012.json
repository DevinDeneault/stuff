I'm curious about whether I should get the enhanced edition for 5$ on Steam per the summer sale, but I already own the gold edition from way back in the day on CD. What would be the reason to get the Enhanced Edition for PC, or would I just be wasting money?</div>"

      "content": "<div>Greetings and hello MrWyrm!<br/>\n<br/>\nEE has higher resolution, keyholing and better network server support, a lot of persistent worlds run on EE only now. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor a casual player wanting to run some of the original campaigns or old custom modules on the NWN Vault, I think the old v1.69 diamond edition would do fine. If you want to log into a persistent world i would recommend EE. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe diamond edition is the product of choice for non EE, however, gold edition - according to Wikipedia says it doesn't include HoTU. Therefore I would recommend getting this for the ability to play characters and load custom modules that require HoTU, therefore in your case it wouldn't be just a waste as you would get something extra to your gold NWN.<br/>\n<br/>\nA little extra too...<br/>\n<br/>\nBeamdog also has a sale at the same time. They write it also provides a steam key, however i cannot see any details of this on their site.<br/>\n<br/>\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" data-s9e-mediaembed=\"reddit\" onload=\"var c=new MessageChannel;c.port1.onmessage=function(e){style.height=e.data+'px'};contentWindow.postMessage('s9e:init','https://s9e.github.io',[c.port2])\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://s9e.github.io/iframe/2/reddit.min.html#neverwinternights/comments/hfszx8\" style=\"border:0;height:165px;max-width:800px;width:100%\"></iframe><br/>\n<br/>\nMight be over soon though. Hope that helps!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Thanks for the response Orion! I'm glad to hear that there are still servers running online for multiplayer! <br/>\n<br/>\nI forgot to mention in the original post that I actually had the Gold edition with HOTU as a separate disc add on. So I totally have most of the content for the game (minus the other modules from platinum). <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm thinking at this point of time (due to quarantine putting me on money saving mode) I might pass on EE for now, and keep an eye out for it in the future. I haven't played the multiplayer in quite a while and am probably far too rusty to enjoy it at my own pace. I appreciate the response and the details towards all of the new content however!</div>"

EE requires a bit more muscle under the hood, so if you are banging around on old machine without a dedicated graphics card, then you may need to reconsider. </div>"
