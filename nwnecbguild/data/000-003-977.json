      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">I'm far from an expert on the mechanics of the game or just DnD in general so developing a build for myself isn't something I'm confident in yet. I'm not the type of person to experiment either and really like to follow guidelines or premade builds because it lets me focus more on playing the game. With that said I've just finished the OC, SoU, and HotU. I don't have any intention to play on a PW as I prefer the single player experience. Currently I want to play through the Aielund Saga.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom what I've read the game mechanics are different and there isn't really a resource for me to check what items/weapons are available in the module. Cause of this I'm having a difficult time looking through the builds in the guild filter to decide what I want. What I'm currently looking to play is a melee character that makes use of either RDD or Monk. Some others I would like to try are builds that include Bard, Paladin, or Cleric. But definitely RDD or Monk as my #1 choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't really have any opinions on weapon choice since I'm not knowledgeable of the type of weapons I'll find within Aielund Saga, but Monk with Kamas is something I would like to try if there are any good Kamas in Aielund. I also would prefer Human race and non evil based builds. Other than that I don't have any more preferences. Thanks ahead of time for any help!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
