Assuming, as in your previous post, that you are playing the OC, you don't want to make it a halfling because heavy cleric levels coupled with an early monk level would result in an XP penalty.

It allows you to extend some of the short term buffs, and also an extended Bulls str at lvl 3 lasts six hours.  2. It allows you to have more of the useful spells available.  Say you are in the heat of battle and get hit by a dispell or one of the buff strippers and  all your third lvl spells have been used.  If you have darkfire in the fourth lvl slot as an extended, you can at least get that up.  Same for all your other spells.  Many builders use the meta magics (Extend, Maximise, empower, silent, still, quicken) for spell book management.  It allows you to cast many different spells and still keep a lot of the buffs going when you need them.<br/>\n<br/>\n  Now to dual wield.  If you want a dual wielder, Don't go Halfling unless you are going for exotic and choose Kukri, or choose dagger (without the exotic feat)  Halfling monks going with the kama and dual wield feat suffer the same penalty that a normal human would if they chose the dual wield and a pair of long swords.

The final choice is up to you and you might be justified in going for the 4th natural attack. As said the 4th natural attack has its upsides and in the end it has to be you to decide what's best for you. You might want, one day, to try both approaches and see what best suits your playstyle. That's the only way to get your own final answer, the one right for you.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
