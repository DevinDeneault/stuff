Please report any problems or errors either downloading or viewing the HTML. There is NO Javascript in the tutorial.\u00a0 I suggest you make a dedicated folder, suitably-named, to include the spreadsheet and tutorial.<br/>\n<br/>\n Same goes for the spreadsheet itself.\u00a0 There are so many columns, I seriously doubt that no errors happened while extracting the metadata and transcribing it, so if you catch any, use this topic to itemize them, please.<br/>\n<br/>\n I highly recommend that you SUBSCRIBE to the project for email notification. That way you will be kept current with the latest revision as I find time to include other builds like the Pre-epic and Bioware legacy ones and/or make corrections to the initial installment without needing to be checking this topic all the time.\u00a0 I have no estimate on when updates will happen at this juncture but will post revision notices in this thread when they occur.<br/>\n<br/>\n For those of you who do not have a Microsoft Office package that contains Excel, there is also a comma-delimited (CSV) version posted on the same page.\u00a0 You will not get the Autofilter or Comments, so the Tutorial will not be useful, I assume.\u00a0 With the raw data, though, you can format within the limitations of whatever spreadsheet software you use.<br/>\n<br/>\n I hope the filter expands your ability to analyze build potential and makes it faster to research your own personal preferences.<br/>\n<br/>\n Later, amigos! <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Open Office is, in essence, and as far as I can work out, a free version of the the Microsoft Office suite provided by Apache (I think). So, no, not Mac - sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n As you may have noticed, my tech expertise is lacking to the extent of redundancy. However...I do have a friend (odd though that may sound) who's due to pop round within the next week to fix some issues I'm having with my pc, so I'll flag this with him, too (along with Icewind fuzzy graphics, Java not being able to update and such like malarkey). He should be interested anyway - he's the bloke who first introduced me to NwN (even though he's never left the city of Neverwinter himself - I'll try to hook him into Aielund instead).<br/>\n<br/>\n Hopefully I'll have something to report back before you go off to consider the lilies, conquer a galaxy, or whatever it is that takes you from us. <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Have done the downloads and, without any meddling on my part, everything works swimmingly. No reformatting, URLs work fine.
