That made me think about this one time when my Dwarven, battle-priest toon was trying to figure out smithing at a forge in my PW (this is like 13 years ago). Anyway, he's sweating and swearing away and in walks this ogre looking PC I'm pretty sure it was a PC or perhaps it was controlled by a DM, I don't know, but it had a name and was obviously being controlled. It was at least twice the size of any normal PC toon I've seen. It jogs over to a forge, tinkers around for a minute\u00a0 (I think I emoted something like *stares in bewildered disbelief*) then plods back out never to be seen again (at least by me). Is this something that you can actually do? Make monster PCs?\u00a0</div>"
