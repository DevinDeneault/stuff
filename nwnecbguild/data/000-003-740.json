      "content": "<div>Hi everyone<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy holidays to everyone at the ECB<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been exploring tanky rogue builds, I like my rogues strength based, clad in full plate + tower, plenty of HP and skill points and of course as much sneak attack as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is an idea I came up with. 32 Base Str, 470+ HP, 425 skill points, Base AB 41 with 20d6 sneak attack, improved knockdown, crippling strike, evasion/improved evasion, slippery mind, +6 to saves against spells. this guy looks like a bit of a beast.<br/>\n<br/>\nUncanny Dodge II onwards provides some pseudosneak sneak attack resistance, although if I took 5 levels in dwarven defender that would have provided sneak attack immunity when flanked but not flatfooted (which would be a different build, I wouldn't be able to dump the dex stat and lose a lot of skill points or HP).<br/>\n<br/>\nOne could go human for an extra 43 skill points to get to close to 500 skill points and a pre-epic bonus feat which you don't really need, or halfling for bonuses to saves but I liked dwarf for this build for the +2 to saves against spells, extra HP and other combat related bonuses.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeakness is the will save which I've mitigated with Iron Will / Slippery mind feats and 21 crossclassed points into spellcraft for +6 to saves against spells so hopefully the will score of 18 won't be too much of an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you wanted you could drop the sneak attack a little by taking an epic skill focus feat in discipline to make you very difficult to knockdown or disarm, but there seems something special about the 20d6 sneak attack value, its like a zebra amongst a bunch of horses.<br/>\n<br/>\nDev crit can be included by dropping iron will, resist energy: acid and expertise and two great strengths for power attack, cleave, great cleave, overwhelming critical and devastating critical. Will drop your Base Str to 30 and Base AB to 40. It is very nasty looking for a rogue.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway haven't play tested this one but I think this looks like a good one.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>STR: 16 (32)\nCON:

Unless you are Feat starved (you are not) or Charisma anaemic (you are, but by choice).<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019d lean towards human with 2 Paladin levels over 2 COT levels, drop int to 14 and raise Charisma to 12.  Net the free human feat to balance the loss of the COT feat, the human skill bonus to balance the skill point loss for dropping int to 14.  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou end up 40 HP lower but immune fear, immune disease, have an equivalent +1 to all saves immediately but offers a more flexible all saves bonus depending on your world for equipment/buffs of course netting up to +6 more over COT AND Paladin saves bonus does not count towards the saves cap which more than balances out the dwarf spell saves with room to spare.  As an added bonus, freeing up your belt slot for +4/5 Charisma gear :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are on an RP server, keep COT, the mechanical advantages of a small Paladin dip over a small COT dip are not worth the RP agony of playing a Paladin IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>"

And paladin is one of those classes where people have a lot of stereotypical ideas of what the class is all about. And that can soon become a problem in multiplayer even if you have an in depth understanding of your character and try to play it according to that, simply because people keep telling you what paladins can do and not. Even DMs may fall into that trap, and that can make life hard for a serious roleplayer.</div>",

Adding rogue levels will cost levels in classes that give more feats.  If the net goal is maxing sneak attack, I suspect swapping all but the 6 Fighter levels needed for 4 APR and Epic Weapon Specialisation would leave you with less sneak attack.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>"

Happy new year!<br/>\n<br/>\nI did think about making a dex version of this build, in addition to epic dodge the melee and ranged AB, AC, reflex score and dex based skills will be better plus one can consider dual wielding and stealth. It is\u00a0 attractive. I'm just used to making Str based characters really, I haven't quite learnt the art of playing a dex-er yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said I thought an AB of 40-41 was pretty decent for a build with 30+ rogue levels<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are lots of ways to get sneak attack without knocking enemies down, solo this could be as simple as hitting them around a corner, using invisibility pots, or UMD to cast a summon and flank them. In a party there will be a multitude of ways to get sneak attack, from simply flanking them in combat, to your mages, druids and cleric casting powerful disable spells such as Bigby's, SoV or Stonehold.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way on the topic of higher AB, if you want even more AB, you might be interested in <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/blackguard-executioner-rogue-17-assassin-1-blackgu-t2355175-s10.html#p17150\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this draft build </a>\u00a0I made. Dev crit scimitar, Base AB 45, 450+ hp, 13d6 sneak attack, max taunt, WS/EWS at lvl 21, its pretty nasty. The main weakness is the will save which UMD is handy to manage. I've played it in WoG to level 38, I probably should put it in the lvl 40 section somewhere, but haven't gotten around to it yet.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Blackguard Executioner -\u00a0\n\nDEX: 8\nWIS: 8\nCHA: 10\nHuman: (Quick to Master)\n02: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus (Scimitar)\n04: Fighter(3): STR+1, (STR=19)\n06: Fighter(5): Knockdown\n08: Fighter(6): STR+1, Improved Knockdown, (STR=20)\n10: Blackguard(2): {Smite Good}\n12: Blackguard(4): STR+1, Toughness, (STR=21)\n14: Blackguard(6)\n16: Blackguard(8): STR+1, (STR=22)\n18: Blackguard(9): Great Cleave\n20: Fighter(7): STR+1, (STR=23)\n22: Rogue(4)\n24: Blackguard(12): STR+1, Great Strength, (STR=25)\n26: Blackguard(14)\n28: Blackguard(15): STR+1, (STR=27)\n30: Rogue(6): Great Strength, (STR=28)\n32: Rogue(8): STR+1, (STR=29)\n34: Rogue(9)\n36: Blackguard(18): STR+1, Great Strength, (STR=32)\n38: Rogue(12)\n40: Blackguard(19): STR+1, Epic Prowess, (STR=34)\nHitpoints: 468\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 25/15/17\nBAB: 29\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 17/28\nAlignment Changes: 0\nDisable Trap 42(46), Discipline 43(55), Hide 5(4), Listen 42(41), Open Lock 1(0), Search 32(34), Set Trap 14(15), Spellcraft 8(10), Taunt 43(43), Tumble 40(39), UMD 33(33)\n\n02: Discipline(5), Save(19),\u00a0\n04: Discipline(1), Save(27),\u00a0\n06: Discipline(1), Save(35),\u00a0\n08: Discipline(2), Save(10),\u00a0\n10: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n12: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(11),\u00a0\n14: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(17),\u00a0\n16: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(23),\u00a0\n18: Discipline(2), Taunt(2), Save(1),\u00a0\n20: Discipline(1), Save(8),\u00a0\n22: Disable Trap(5), Listen(6), Tumble(5), UMD(5), Save(2),\u00a0\n24: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n26: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(10),\u00a0\n28: Discipline(2), Taunt(2), Save(1),\u00a0\n30: Disable Trap(3), Listen(9), UMD(3),\u00a0\n32: Disable Trap(1), Listen(1), Search(1), Tumble(5), Save(3),\u00a0\n34: Disable Trap(2), Listen(2), Search(7),\u00a0\n36: Discipline(3), Taunt(3), Save(2),\u00a0\n38: Disable Trap(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(5), Save(3),\u00a0\n40: Discipline(4), Taunt(4),\u00a0\n</details></div>"

The thing is however; whatever works against human opponents generally still wrecks anything PvE (maybe more slowly, but they will go down, and the toon wont). Naturally, server rules or which specific module you're playing (which items are available) will hugely affect what is optimal. I mean, some server nerf the cleric quite a bit and whether knockdown immunity or haste items are available for example also affects a lot. Generally, (ignoring XP penalties or RP) I find the Paladin class a lot more powerful than the Blackguard class. This largely boils down to 1: Divine Favor, Bless, Aid, (Extented) Prayer and GMW (depending on items on server). Again, if reaching the +20 to attack cap is easily attainable on the server/module these arguments diminish (this is even more important in regards to Clerics).<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain for Dex, Paladin mixes better with BG as you don't need to pick Power Attack and Cleave.

I guess such environments might be fun for some but I just don't enjoy hurting other players, I'd rather the DMs create a challenging and changing environment to deal with, preferably in a party<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are diverging off topic here hehe we should move a few of these posts into a new paladin vs blackguard thread<br/>\n<br/>\nRE Paladin vs Blackguard in PvM, I wouldn't say paladin is 'a lot more powerful', I used to think so, I think there are certain advantages to taking Blackguard that are under-utilised, which include avoiding xp penalties, role-playing matters,\u00a0sneak attack, full BAB class pre-epic, epic bonus feats every 3 levels from level 10 onwards which include all the good ones like EWF/EP/Dev Crit/AS, two summons/day including the Vrock to help sneak attack enemies, avoiding significant investment in wisdom, stackable bull's strength, use poison if its buffed.<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly in pre-epic levels Blackguard is a lot of fun, and the Vrock is still useful later on<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd seriously role playing is much more fun as a blackguard. 'I'm a big bad blackguard and I'm going to kill you with my undead and demonic summons and big bastard sword' is much more interesting that the good old paladin's 'a good deed is its own reward' -&gt; that is way too selfless heh, particularly after a long day at work when you've been giving of yourself to others for most of it<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can avoid taking power attack and cleave by taking one or more levels of monk for a dex build, its probably quite desirable anyway for the crazy APR particularly with dual kamas, to add a little sneak attack</div>"

All the power, and then some more power (did I say power?), and at least as evil. Casting uncontrolled balors in \"surprising\" locations for the amusement of all, or putting piles of gold (or player corpses) on top of a bunch of deadly traps and serving the hapless fools with some implosions on top (or demanding \"all\" their food, as my evil goblin cleric used to do).

Just add a light amount of rogue, and either a tiny sprinkle of monk for crazy AC or a small serving of fighter for WS/EWS and you're done :)</div>"
