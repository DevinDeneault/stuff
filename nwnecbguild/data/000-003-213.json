I've had great assistance from Messrs Kane and Empyre, and hope I haven't let them down too badly. Before putting his stats up, I'd like to say a couple of things:- i) my initial concept was WM and Barbarian for the main two classes, but one of the game's foibles (being nice) is that it's not allowed for a Weapon <em>Master</em> to specialize in his own weapon, so Fighter became a necessity; and ii) he's designed to only use light or medium armour, just because that's how I pictured him at the outset, so please no tutting on that score (there will be plenty of other opportunities, I'm sure).<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and I'm aware that his saves are cack, so any advice would be particularly welcome on that score - as indeed on any other matters.<br/>\n<br/>\n And on that note, what do the great and good think?<br/>\n<br/>\n JAG HARDBREAD<br/>\n WM 25 / F 10 / R 5<br/>\n Human, Chaotic Good<br/>\n PvM levels 1-40<br/>\n<br/>\n STR -

What's the point?<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh wait - you miscalculated the AB. It's 45 - not bad . . . but for an investment of 25 levels, I'd want to have an AB of at least 48 if not 50.<br/>\n<br/>\n I don't know the purpose of taking DEX to 18 unless you're restricting him to scale/chain shirt. If you're not dual wielding, I'd drop DEX to 14 and go with Breast Plate/Chain Mail and invest those points into CON. (-1) AC/(-1) Reflex but 80 HP and +2 Fortitude, which helps keep you from getting Dev Critted.<br/>\n<br/>\n I might also consider going F6 RO4 WM 10 pre-epic - I think you'd end up with more epic feats with more fighter in epic levels. \u00a0Otherwise, I'd also look at either F7 RO5 WM28 or F10 RO2 WM28 as my final split - both are playable all the way up.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

His feat order could be a lot better as well (take wf &amp; expertise first lvl and so on) but can't go hard on Stag...

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hey, Stag!<br/>\n<br/>\n I know I am repeating myself when I say this, but this is only happening now because you're playing the OC. You may think your \"really powerful\" toon is destroying everything and doesn't need to worry about little useless moves like Knockdown to kill anything. For the OCs, that's absolutely 100% true. You don't even need Tumble to avoid getting hit, or anything for that matter. You don't even need AB to hit, as a Wizard will still hit pretty much anything without any buffs. Buffs, which, BTW, NEVER EVER EVER get dispelled.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, because you're playing the most unchallenging environment, you'll have a completely biased perception of the usefulness of feats. For example, I loved Cleave, when I played the OCs, because it gave me an extra attack when I was surrounded by enemies. But now that I play on WoG, I realize it's not THAT useful, because if I get surrounded by enemies, I'll probably die. Same thing with Expertise. You may think: \"why would ANYONE trade 5 AB for 5 AC EVER?\", but that's only because you never get hit in the OCs, no matter how low your AC is. When you play on WoG, you fight a guy with 25+ AB who crits for 100 damage at level 12-13, if you don't have expertise, you'll DIE faster than you can type: \"What?\" in your chatbox. Even with Expertise you might die anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\n I'd like to invite you to read my Playing Better guide in the Game Guides Section. There, you'll see a brief summary of my NWN experience, and I'm sure you'll relate to the first part of the tale. Your beliefs and perceptions of the usefulness of feats as well as the class combos or characteristics of the build you want to play will change drastically as you begin to challenge yourself. All you need is the willingness to do it. No matter how many times I tell you this, you'll only truly understand me when you've experienced it. So, are you ready to allow Experience to change your perception or will you be a Mephistopheles Slayer for the rest of your NWN life?<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Have been out of circulation for a couple of weeks (playing BG for a bit of a rest cure - but don't tell anyone!), sorry I didn't reply earlier. I've also had a proper look at your optimum WM build and see where it scores over mine here - learning as we go!<br/>\n<br/>\n As to a different playing environment, I am hoping to load up Adam Miller's campaign soon, and I believe that enables me to take a character from 1-40 and is much more of a lower magic environment, so I should b better able to judge the build's merit. I'll also look more closely at WoG, and, indeed your Playing Better Guide.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
