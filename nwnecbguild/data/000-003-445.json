Your starting stats are bad, making him much weaker than he could be. You don't have ANY tumble whatsoever and you have 30 Persuade. In terms of powerbuilding, well, you're simply not powerbuilding. If you are going to be a caster Cleric, then you're better off using the Zen Archery feat, because that makes your casting stat also your attacking stat. Taking feats such as , Called Shot, Rapid Shot and Point Blank shot while using a Longbow (will need Martial Weapons Proficiency for that) is your best bet and whatever you can't cast to death, you'll be able to kill in ranged combat. I have a Cleric guide in this guild that will probably make you want to reconsider the way you've built this toon and also a build that is very very similar to yours, but with a more clear focus. Let me post you the links so you can get started on your learning process:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- A Complete Guide to the Basics of Character Building: this guide will help you with some basic concepts of building that can be applied while using pretty much any class combo:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/a-complete-guide-to-the-basics-of-character-building-t515440.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/a-com ... 15440.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n2- An Insight into the Cleric Class: This is a guide that will discuss the Cleric class in depth, and later on (some 5 posts after the main one) I also discuss the Cleric / Monk combo, which IMO is THE BEST COMBO IN THE GAME:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/an-insight-into-the-cleric-class-t515461.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/an-in ... 15461.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n3- The Demolition Man: this is a build of mine that uses Cleric the way I described above, but much more effectively than you here, because it has MUCH HIGHER starting Wisdom score, plus it focuses on both spell DCs (which makes it that much harder for mobs to succeed their saving throws against your spells (meaning you kill more frequently with instant death spells and anything else you decide to use). In regular campaigns, the monster saves and stats in general aren't at all competitive, so you can really be fooled by the fact that your build is doing so well there. I remember once I built a Ranger / Weapon Master who used to dual-wield rapiers and he cruised through HoTU. And just in case you're wondering, dual-wielding Rapiers is a very bad option because of the penalty involved. Take a look at it so you can begin to understand what Character Building is about. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/demolition-man-cleric-38-monk-1-rogue-1-t515420.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/demol ... 15420.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome to a new world of class combos and powergaming, my friend. As you will hopefully learn if you stick with us for long enough, Neverwinter Nights is THE MOST COMPLEX AND CUSTOMIZABLE GAME in terms of character buildings. There are 23 classes, and 40 levels through which you can distribute any amount of levels of three different classes, plus six starting stats and 10 stat increases from 1 to 40, plus feats, requirements, epic feats, and combos that you never thought possible up until now. If you're one of those people (like myself) who love games where actually knowing more, being a better player actually makes a difference, then NWN is the best game you'll ever find. I have been playing this game for 10 years, and there's still so much that I don't know!<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

You can ask the Set-up Helper (or whatever her name is) to reset all your levels, and  she will reset your level to 1, but you keep your experience, so you can re-do all the leveling. You cannot re-do what you did when creating your level 1 character, so this build does the best I can do to turn that into a watered-down version of Max's Demolition Man. Because 2 feats were wasted at level 1 with Dodge and Luck of Heroes, and the lower INT means no skill points for UMD, I decided to throw in some Fighter to replace the lost feats. I even managed to squeeze in Extend Spell. The result is definitely not as goos as Demolition Man, but it should be good enough. Remember to save your character after rebuilding him. One more thing, use the item maker guy to make a bow like you would have had Risolvr make on his forge, and make a kama with acid damage, because there are some monsters in Sands of Fate that can only be killed with acid damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSpoiler<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t[+]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tMonk Cleric Rebuilt (Monk 5 / Cleric 31 / Fighter 4)<br/>\nHuman, Any Lawful<br/>\nPlayable 1  40, PvM<br/>\n<br/>\nAbilities:<br/>\nSTR: 14<br/>\nDEX: 14<br/>\nCON: 12<br/>\nWIS: 14 (30)<br/>\nINT: 10<br/>\nCHA: 14<br/>\n<br/>\nLeveling Guide:<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Monk(1): Dodge, Luck of Heroes, {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}<br/>\n02: Cleric(1): Domain Trickery, Domain Plant<br/>\n03: Fighter(1): Rapid Shot, Point Blank Shot<br/>\n04: Cleric(2): WIS+1, (WIS=15)<br/>\n05: Cleric(3)<br/>\n06: Cleric(4): Zen Archery<br/>\n07: Cleric(5)<br/>\n08: Cleric(6): WIS+1, (WIS=16)<br/>\n09: Cleric(7): Weapon Focus: Longbow<br/>\n10: Cleric(8)<br/>\n11: Cleric(9)<br/>\n12: Monk(2): WIS+1, Extend Spell, {Deflect Arrows}, (WIS=17)<br/>\n13: Cleric(10)<br/>\n14: Cleric(11)<br/>\n15: Cleric(12): Spell Focus: Evocation<br/>\n16: Fighter(2): WIS+1, Called Shot, (WIS=18)<br/>\n17: Cleric(13)<br/>\n18: Cleric(14): Greater Spell Focus: Evocation<br/>\n19: Cleric(15)<br/>\n20: Cleric(16): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br/>\n21: Cleric(17): Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow<br/>\n22: Monk(3)<br/>\n23: Fighter(3)<br/>\n24: Fighter(4): WIS+1, Weapon Specialization: Longbow, Epic Weapon Specialization: Longbow, (WIS=20)<br/>\n25: Cleric(18)<br/>\n26: Cleric(19)<br/>\n27: Monk(4): Epic Spell Focus: Evocation<br/>\n28: Cleric(20): WIS+1, (WIS=21)<br/>\n29: Cleric(21)<br/>\n30: Cleric(22): Epic Prowess<br/>\n31: Cleric(23): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=22)<br/>\n32: Cleric(24): WIS+1, (WIS=23)<br/>\n33: Cleric(25): Great Wisdom II, (WIS=24)<br/>\n34: Cleric(26): Great Wisdom III, (WIS=25)<br/>\n35: Cleric(27)<br/>\n36: Cleric(28): WIS+1, Great Wisdom IV, (WIS=27)<br/>\n37: Monk(5)<br/>\n38: Cleric(29): Great Wisdom V, (WIS=28)<br/>\n39: Cleric(30): Great Wisdom VI, (WIS=29)<br/>\n40: Cleric(31): WIS+1, (WIS=30)<br/>\n<br/>\nStats:<br/>\nHitpoints: 368<br/>\nSkillpoints: 145<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 28/34/21<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8, Mind Effects: +2<br/>\nBAB: 25<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 28 (melee), 39 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 31/31<br/>\nSpell Casting: Cleric(9)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nSkills:<br/>\nConcentration 43(44), Heal 18(28), Persuade 4(6), Spellcraft 40(40), Tumble 40(42)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Concentration(4), Persuade(4), Tumble(4), Save(8)<br/>\n02: Concentration(1), Heal(5), Spellcraft(5)<br/>\n03: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Save(1)<br/>\n04: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(2)<br/>\n05: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(1)<br/>\n06: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(2)<br/>\n07: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(3)<br/>\n08: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(4)<br/>\n09: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(5)<br/>\n10: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(6)<br/>\n11: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(7)<br/>\n12: Concentration(1), Tumble(11)<br/>\n13: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(2)<br/>\n14: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1)<br/>\n15: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1)<br/>\n16: Concentration(1), Save(2)<br/>\n17: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(2), Save(2)<br/>\n18: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(3)<br/>\n19: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(4)<br/>\n20: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(5)<br/>\n21: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(6)<br/>\n22: Concentration(1), Tumble(10)<br/>\n23: Concentration(1), Heal(2)<br/>\n24: Concentration(1), Save(2)<br/>\n25: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(4)<br/>\n26: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(1)<br/>\n27: Concentration(1), Tumble(5)<br/>\n28: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(2)<br/>\n29: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1)<br/>\n30: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1)<br/>\n31: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(1)<br/>\n32: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(2)<br/>\n33: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(3)<br/>\n34: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(4)<br/>\n35: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(5)<br/>\n36: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(6)<br/>\n37: Concentration(1), Tumble(10)<br/>\n38: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1)<br/>\n39: Concentration(1), Heal(2)<br/>\n40: Concentration(1), Heal(2)</div>",

Let me post you the links so you can get started on your learning process:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- A Complete Guide to the Basics of Character Building: this guide will help you with some basic concepts of building that can be applied while using pretty much any class combo:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/a-complete-guide-to-the-basics-of-character-building-t515440.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/a-com ... 15440.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n2- An Insight into the Cleric Class: This is a guide that will discuss the Cleric class in depth, and later on (some 5 posts after the main one) I also discuss the Cleric / Monk combo, which IMO is THE BEST COMBO IN THE GAME:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/an-insight-into-the-cleric-class-t515461.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/an-in ... 15461.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n3- The Demolition Man: this is a build of mine that uses Cleric the way I described above, but much more effectively than you here, because it has MUCH HIGHER starting Wisdom score, plus it focuses on both spell DCs (which makes it that much harder for mobs to succeed their saving throws against your spells (meaning you kill more frequently with instant death spells and anything else you decide to use). In regular campaigns, the monster saves and stats in general aren't at all competitive, so you can really be fooled by the fact that your build is doing so well there. I remember once I built a Ranger / Weapon Master who used to dual-wield rapiers and he cruised through HoTU. And just in case you're wondering, dual-wielding Rapiers is a very bad option because of the penalty involved. Take a look at it so you can begin to understand what Character Building is about. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/demolition-man-cleric-38-monk-1-rogue-1-t515420.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/demol ... 15420.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWelcome to a new world of class combos and powergaming, my friend. As you will hopefully learn if you stick with us for long enough, Neverwinter Nights is THE MOST COMPLEX AND CUSTOMIZABLE GAME in terms of character buildings. There are 23 classes, and 40 levels through which you can distribute any amount of levels of three different classes, plus six starting stats and 10 stat increases from 1 to 40, plus feats, requirements, epic feats, and combos that you never thought possible up until now. If you're one of those people (like myself) who love games where actually knowing more, being a better player actually makes a difference, then NWN is the best game you'll ever find. I have been playing this game for 10 years, and there's still so much that I don't know!<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div></blockquote>\n\nThanks - I looked at those right after I posted.  The Cleric Guide and Demolition Man were very informative.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I neglected to stress was that I'm also (for RP purposes) trying to focus exclusively on Unarmed Strike as the weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have PGCC 4.4 - I'm going to reset his levels and rebuild to level 28 using the suggestions I get here.</div>"

I doubt you can make characters that could be considered good at an early stage. I happen to have explored Cleric / Monks A LOT and I have one that will top everything you can think of. Let me point you in the right direction:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/bigby-s-small-hand-complex-monk-20-cleric-15-sd-5-t521694.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/bigby ... 21694.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nCheck the last version of this build, which is not in the OP (Original Post). I had made him a Halfling at first, which is entirely possible, but ended up having him remade as a Human. Both versions are good, but especially for SP campaigns where XP is limited, XP penalty hurts a lot, so you should definitely go for the Human version.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd you can PM me if any doubts come up as to how to play this build if the Cleric guide isn't clear enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

His AC will suffer greatly, of course, so you will need many Heal potions or a Cleric Henchman to heal you. I wouldn't recommend a Monk RDD to focus on Monk, except perhaps for the speed bonus, so I would go Monk 10 Sorcerer 20 RDD 10, losing a couple of BAB points by going Monk 8 RDD 10 Sorcerer 2 pre-epic. that way you'd have a full arcane spellbook, while losing some movespeed and unarmed damage (but gaining Time Stop for instance, which is invaluable)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what the OP is requesting is a Cleric Monk, and the advantage of that combo is that it will have equivalent damage to this toon you posted, thanks to divine buffs like GMW, Divine Power, Divine Favor, Darkfire, Prayer and Battletide, while having a truly spectacular AC (Wis and Dex gear and buffs + robes, Monk boots and whatnot). I remember my Magical Master toon went through the ENTIRE Ironlord army of golems in chapter 3 of The Aielund Saga without quaffing a SINGLE HEAL potion. He simply wouldn't get hit! By the time the army reached the Keep, there was only the giant golem and the Ironlord himself left to kill. I even had to teleport to the capital city before the battle to drop my henchmen cuz they kept getting killed, which made me have to reload a couple of times. If you haven't had the chance of playing any toon with this class combo, you really gotta do it to feel the power!<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

I don't remember much of the module anymore. I played it last 3 years ago. Maybe I should play it again just to refresh my memory. IMO it's the greatest NWN SP module there is.</div>"

What I wonder is if they have any STR requirement to match in order to equip them, do they?</div>"
