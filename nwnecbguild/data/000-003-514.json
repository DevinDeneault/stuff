The only givens as far as I can tell is that is must be a dwarf with waraxe and capped at 30 levels with DevCrit a possibility.

Whether XP penalty is an important issue or not is another significant clarification that is needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are definitely NOT meeting one of the OP's prereqs...

      "content": "<div>I see a strong preference for DwDs in the OP's request and possibly a misconception linking DwD with good AC per se (they get +4 dodge AC in defensive stance only), while DwD is evidently about Damage Reduction. And while DwD has peculiar defensive powers they are not hindering its offensive capabilities compared to other straight melee classes, but evidently WM which is evidently centered about offense. What I mean is that a FTR/DwD/Rogue is not any less offensive than a FTR/CoT/Rogue, for example.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also find it's not really always appropriate to suggest cleric as the solution to \"all\" problems. Sometimes one just does not want to play a cleric. IMO, we shouldn't necessarily go for those fews uber builds; there's more about character building than doing and redoing the same 10-20 builds, no matter how good they may be. I find enjoyment in playing also less powerful builds, tweaked and optimized to achieve a specific role and purpouse.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, I apologize if I came across harsher than I meant. My dear avado, dude, sometimes just try not to suggest clerics.. it might be a refreshing experience</div>"

That one doesn't have Tumble as a class skill nor other means to enhance AC, so I tend to assume it doesn't fulfill the OP's requirements. How about a Rogue DWD SD dexer with Epic Dodge? Something like Rogue 15 SD 1 DwD 14? Sub-par DR, but with ED and HiPS it would be OK regardless. What do you think? There is the advantage that these classes share the same requirement: Dodge. Too tired to cough up an entire build now, already midnight here in Brazil. If anyone wants to do the work go ahead, otherwise I'll do it when I get time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do feel guilty as to what Kail was saying cuz I already suggested Cleric Bard PM twice so I shall refain from doing this for a while .

A dev critting DwD can be a pretty nice build. Speaking about lvl 40, a FTR 20/Bard 4/PM 16 dev critter crit immune, epic spell caster is nothing bad at all. If epic spells are not desired, then PM 10 is enough. How to make it work in lvl 30? I'll look into it, now I gotta go</div>"

I thought it is only worth for 7 lvls or maximum 13.. for the +1 AB..?\n</div></blockquote>\nKail answered this concisely.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, of all classes the ones that increase AB the fastest (which is extremely important in an abbreviated build like this) are WM &amp; AA.  Waraxe rules out AA so that leaves WM as a non-magical solution to fast AB boosting.  7 levels of WM = +1 AB. 19 Levels of WM = +4 AB.  That AB boost would take 8 Great Strength feats to accomplish.  Level 13 WM is only scratching the surface of the class potential.  To compare to an AA:  19 levels of AA = +10 AB (or 20 Great Dex or 20 Great Wis/Zen feats).<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's another in a more typical, DR-type focused DwD mold but relies on magical enhancements with excellent saves and divine/magical damage (oddly enough, w/o a single cleric level  ):<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladin 10/Dwarven Defender 10/Champion of Torm 10, Dwarf, Lawful Good<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 14 (20)<br/>\nDEX: 13<br/>\nCON: 12<br/>\nWIS: 11 (12)<br/>\nINT: 12<br/>\nCHA: 14 (18)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Pal 1 - Weapon Proficiency Exotic<br/>\n02: Pal 2 <br/>\n03: Pal 3 - Weapon Focus: Dwarven Waraxe<br/>\n04: Pal 4 - CHA+1 (15)<br/>\n05: Pal 5<br/>\n06: Pal 6 - Power Attack<br/>\n07: Pal 7<br/>\n08: CoT 1 - WIS+1 (12)<br/>\n09: CoT 2 - Toughness, Dodge<br/>\n10: DwD 1 <br/>\n11: CoT 3<br/>\n12: Pal 8 - CHA+1 (16), Divine Shield<br/>\n13: CoT 4 - Cleave<br/>\n14: DwD 2 <br/>\n15: Pal 9 - Divine Might<br/>\n16: DwD 3 - CHA+1 (17)<br/>\n17: DwD 4<br/>\n18: DwD 5 - Blind Fight<br/>\n19: DwD 6<br/>\n20: CoT 5 - CHA+1, (18)<br/>\n21: CoT 6 - Grt Str I (15), EWF: Dwarven Waraxe<br/>\n22: CoT 7<br/>\n23: CoT 8 - Epic Prowess<br/>\n24: CoT 9 - STR+1, Grt Str II (17)<br/>\n25: CoT 10 - Armor Skin<br/>\n26: DwD 7<br/>\n27: DwD 8 - Grt Str III (18)<br/>\n28: DwD 9 - STR+1 (19)<br/>\n29: DwD 10<br/>\n30: Pal 10 - Grt Str IV (20)<br/>\n<br/>\nHP: 380  (440 w/DS)<br/>\nSaves (F/W/R): 30/24/24 (35/29/29 vs. spells)<br/>\nOther save bonuses: Traps: +1, Poison: +2<br/>\nBAB: 25<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 34 (melee), 27 (ranged); 45 (melee, buffed w/DS)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 16/27; 43 (buffed, hasted w/DS)<br/>\n<br/>\nSkills: 99<br/>\nDiscipline 33(38), Heal 6(7), Spellcraft 15(16), Tumble 15(16)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Disc(4), Spcr(2), Tumb(2)<br/>\n02: Disc(1), S - 2<br/>\n03: Disc(1), Spcr(1), Tumb(1)<br/>\n04: Disc(1), S - 2<br/>\n05: Disc(1), Spcr(1), Tumb(1)<br/>\n06: Disc(1), S - 2<br/>\n07: Disc(1), Spcr(1), Tumb(1)<br/>\n08: Disc(1), S - 2<br/>\n09: Disc(1), Spcr(1), Tumb(1)<br/>\n10: Disc(1), S - 2<br/>\n11: Disc(1), Spcr(1), Tumb(1)<br/>\n12: Disc(1), S - 2<br/>\n13: Disc(1), Spcr(1), Tumb(1)<br/>\n14: Disc(1), S - 2<br/>\n15: Disc(1), Spcr(1), Tumb(1)<br/>\n16: Disc(1), S - 2<br/>\n17: Disc(1), Spcr(1), Tumb(1)<br/>\n18: Disc(1), S - 2<br/>\n19: Disc(1), Spcr(1), Tumb(1)<br/>\n20: Disc(1), S - 2<br/>\n21: Disc(1), Spcr(1), Tumb(1)<br/>\n22: Disc(1), S - 2<br/>\n23: Disc(1), Spcr(1), Tumb(1)<br/>\n24: Disc(1), S - 2<br/>\n25: Disc(1), Spcr(1), Tumb(1)<br/>\n26: Disc(1), S - 2<br/>\n27: Disc(1), Spcr(1), Tumb(1)<br/>\n28: Disc(1), S - 2<br/>\n29: Disc(1), S - 4<br/>\n30: Disc(1), Heal(6)</div>"

You lose 1 to all saves, but the CoT bonus feat is recovered by DWD 14, and you get another DS use and 3/- DR. <br/>\n<br/>\n@ Wishmaker<br/>\n<br/>\nFor lvl 40 high AC build Bard PM RDD followed VERY CLOSELY by Cleric Bard PM (which has a much better offense). For level 30, however, you'd have to stop bard at 10 in the first alternative, so not much mojo there without either crippling AB and going Bard 4 PM 16 RDD 10 and basically having no spells or Cleric Bard PM 16/4/10 which to me seems like the best alternative. Now if you're so quick to dismiss DwD then you just want the raw power, that's what I would recommend.

With about 400 HPs for a level 30 build, I feel that extra 3/- DR is more defensive and less significant with a high HP build and therefore opted for the more offensive route which is tough enough when dealing with a non-cleric DwD build.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost likely, if this build were to progress into further levels, more DwD levels would make sense, but not with a 30-level cap. That's my reasoning, but your points are all well-acknowledged, Max.</div>"

But I haven't faced ONE SINGLE ENEMY either in Aielund, WoG, both brazillian PWs, OCs or training mod, that I can say I managed to kill because of this feat. It just doesn't last long enough. We are having a discussion right now in the WoG forums asking the DMs to increase its duration with CoT levels, because the default setting for it makes it worthless. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a once-per-day less than 10 round long buff. Won't even last one encounter. You do have good CHA, but not really all that buffable without UMD, as you'd generally use more Bull's than Eagle's or AoG, therefore I'd still prefer the extra DwD, but I guess it's just preference. <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"
