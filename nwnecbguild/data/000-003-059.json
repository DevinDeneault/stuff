I'm afraid I won't be of much use to you here - all that spell malarkey is beyond me - but until someone who knows what they're doing comes along, have you had a read of Mick Dagger's wonderous guide to bards (in the Game Guides sub-forum)?<br/>\n<br/>\nGood to have you with us!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Ah, it appears the full post one is replying to now replicates - this could become annoying. It's probably me not navigating our new host very well as yet, but we'll see.</div>",

      "content": "<div>Welcome Skeleton Pope! \u00a0It's an interesting concept. \u00a0It's tough when you're stat-strapped.<br/>\n<br/>\nBard 16 gives the ability to cast level 6 spells (you need a total CHA score of 22 though) so your current spread only allows you to cast up to level 4. \u00a0It's not too big of a deal as there is a lot overlap between the Bard and Wizard spells lists at level 5 and 6, with the major gaps being Mass Heal, Dirge. \u00a0The other gap is not being able to cast an Extended War Cry in the level 5 slot.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you only have a total of 160 rounds of music (song is only 10 rounds) for both buffing and cursing so you do have to be more diligent in song use. \u00a0You can't take Lasting Inspiration because it requires 20 Bard levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here are quick suggestions but most involve some sort of tradeoff. \u00a0I may have more when I get more time to mull on this.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. \u00a0Replace Lasting Inspiration with one of the following:\n<ul>\n<li>Great Charisma to get access to level 5 spells and extended level 4 bard spells</li>\n<li>Lingering Song to give you a 15 round song</li>\n<li>Toughness to get an extra 40 HP</li>\n<li>Silent Spell to give you extra castings of True Strike (to help your AB) with only a 1 level penalty (it can't be Extended)</li>\n</ul>\n2. \u00a0Replace Improved Knockdown with one of the following:\n<ul>\n<li>Toughness to get an extra 40 HP if not chosen above</li>\n<li>Weapon Proficiency Martial and choose a more effective weapon - if you pick Longsword it will help if you use Tenser's</li>\n</ul></div>"
