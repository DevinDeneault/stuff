      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hey man!<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been thinking about this build. I knew I had a problem with it, but I just couldn't figure out what it was. Now I think I know. The build itself is original and you do make the best out of it, but the problem is that not only are there very few synergies (only one I can identify so far is BG and PAL adding CHA to saves), but they actually get in the way of one another. To be a Dwarven Defender, you obviously need to be a Dwarf, so -2 to Charisma, which lowers your saves, -2 pre-spic feats spent in requirements and a MUST 13 DEX to qualify for Dodge, so another 5 stat points needed there. To be a Paladin at lvl 1 you need to have 11 Wisdom, which eats up 3 more of your starting ability points and leave you with loads of odd stats and 10 CON for a dwarf. Blackguard not only requires a change of alignment, but it also requires Power Attack and Cleave, which alongside the Dodge and Toughness requirements of DD eat up 4 of your pre-epic feats and 8 of your starting statpoints.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, there is a better way to get all that you aim for in this build with these 3 melee classes. You don't have UMD, no Tumble as a Class Skill and no EDR feats for a 30 DD build. That means you pay a very expensive price for the goods these classes give you. Kudos for trying to combine them in a way that has never been done, you did your best with what you had, you just had a very tough job combining these 3 classes into a build. Rogue can give you AC (through Tumble) and Epic Dodge, CoT can give saves, and DR, well, that can't be improved except if you went for EDR, but with such heavy stat constraints, there was just no way.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">The 6 points in charisma over the leveling seems a waste given how close your build is to getting eagle's splendor and aura of glory.  If you replaced 4 Dwarven Defender levels with  3 paladin and 1 blackguard and replaced the 6 charisma increases with only 4 increases to charisma, one  increase to wisdom and the feat you would have lost from four less Dwarven defender the result would be:<br/>\n3/- less DR<br/>\n+6 to saves, +3 to smite AB (from higher charisma after buffs)  <br/>\n+ 1d6 sneak attack damage<br/>\n+3 smite evil damage, +1 smite good damage<br/>\n<br/>\nand that doesn't include the fact that if you started with one charisma less, you could buy one wisdom and one dexterity for the same point buy price.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Okay, rather than trying to dissect this beast in a vain attempt to extract more of the marrow, let's get down to the basics, shall we?<br/>\n<br/>\n With the mention of things like \"PvP, possibly PvM\", the casual reference to reaching +12 CHA cap and the equally-casual mention of +20 weaponry in the attack stats, I can only conclude that this toon was intended exclusively for a high-magic environment.\u00a0 Mid-magic would certainly not offer +20 enhancements in your wildest dreams.\u00a0 So, once we have assured where this will be played, some generalizations can be extrapolated.\u00a0 DevCrit, the PM and RDD classes will be allowed.\u00a0 You'll see many uber AC/DEX builds and especially AAs (to oppose them) because damage enhancements like elemental, +damage types, massive criticals, OnHit props, etc. will flow like wine.\u00a0 And most likely the player base has enough sense to build LN, TN or CN toons to avoid smites, the easiest defense there is.\u00a0 Let us not even mention high-level arcanists and clerics as potential threats.\u00a0 Also, high-magic environments tend to neutralize alignment restrictions by providing an alignment manager of some sort.\u00a0 You'll never see any of the alignment shift scripting for killing neutrals or nasty convo choices since they focus on pure combat in some form, PvM or PvP, and a manager takes the needless headache out of the mix.<br/>\n<br/>\n This build has neither the AB nor the AC to compete with any competitive designs likely to be lurking around these sorts of environments.\u00a0 Figure on encountering loads of stealth WMs. If I had to make a last gasp effort to help it survive more than 3 rounds vs. any DevCrit build, I would trade Div Might in for Div Shield so it has more time to issue lucky crits before death.<br/>\n<br/>\n Apologies for bursting this bubble, but it just won't work for high-magic PvP at all. The combat stats are too pedestrian and the combo itself, as Max already pointed out elegantly, has poor synergy. Pie-in-the-sky ideas like this would be better posted in the <strong><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/forums/60563/Build-RequestUnfinalized-Builds\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#0000FF\">Unfinalized subforum</span></a></strong> to give others the opportunity to chime in with their ideas about how to possibly morph it into something worthy of the complete and tested Level 40 builds already inhabiting our fair venue.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n edit: Without engaging in the build analysis itself, let me at least pass on appreciation for the presentation itself.\u00a0 It is comprehensive and well-organized enough so that others could immediately begin testing it themselves.... and THAT is worth a lot!\u00a0 It may turn out to be a decent party tank, as well.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
