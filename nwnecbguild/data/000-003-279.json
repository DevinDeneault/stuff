So I'd like some help and suggestions with this build. I prefer it to be a PVP build, and the only things I want to -not- change are the fact that it's a stealth build, unarmed weapon use.<br/>\n<br/>\n 1. Monk - Cleave, Monk AC, Stunning Fist, Evasion, Flurry of Blows, Improved Unarmed Strike, Dodge, Toughness<br/>\n 2. Monk - Deflect Arrows<br/>\n 3.

If you are planning to hide in combat rogue will just not cut it, you need HiPS for that imho.<br/>\n<br/>\n Another thing that i will suggest to you is to take only the minimum level for blackguard and instead focus on get monk to 20th lvl for mind immunity plus all the nice bonusses, something like Monk 25/ Blackguard 4/ SD 1 will be nice. If you are not allowed to take a single lvl from a prestige class ( i think arelithh has something like this as a house rule) then Monk 20/ BG 7/ SD 3.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Yes, there is an Arelith rule that you have to take at least 3 of every class you take. 20 Monk is fine, I still intended for Monk to be the build's main class. I don't know how good Shadowdancer would be on Arelith, I  think HiPS might be nerfed there. Also, taking less BG levels would be fine, the only feats I would really like to get from it are Divine Might/Shield.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">If shadowdancer is nerfed then there is no reason to take it, we stick to the rogue then.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now as i saw in your sample build you intent to go the dexterity route and that's fine but with the blackguard inside the build, you now need all stats making this really hard to achieve high attributes. Here is how i would roughly go,<br/>\n<br/>\n Elf: (STR 10\u00a0 DEX 16\u00a0 CON 12\u00a0 INT10\u00a0 WIS 12\u00a0 CHA 16), then go Monk 16/ BG 4 pre-epic to get 16 BAB and thus 6 attacks with your fists. Take BG at 7th, 8th, 9th lvls and get Divine Shield at your 9th lvl. Then take the 4th BG lvl at 12th lvl in order to get Divine Might. You will need power attack before you can take any of the BG levels so keep that in mind, (cleave is free from Monk). Once you get into the epic levels you should take rogue first (3 levels) in order to get Uncanny Dodge that will protect your AC. Finish as (Monk 21/ BG 4/ Rogue 5).<br/>\n<br/>\n Feats pre-epic: Power attack, Weapon finesse, Weapon focus, Improved critical, Blind fight, Divine might, Divine shield.<br/>\n Feats post-epic: Armour skin, Epic weapon focus, Epic prowess, Great Dexterity I.<br/>\n<br/>\n Final stats, Elf: (STR 10\u00a0 DEX 24\u00a0 CON 12\u00a0 INT 10\u00a0 WIS 12\u00a0 CHA 16)<br/>\n<br/>\n Skills in order of preference: Discipline, Hide, Move Silently, UMD, Spellcraft<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Tell me what you think empty,<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
