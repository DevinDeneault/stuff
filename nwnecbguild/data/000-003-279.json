We do this trick in order to get as-many-as-possible epic feats.There is an option to finish this build with 30 STR by going (Barbarian 17/ Rogue 5/ Fighter 8) but you will lose 1 DR (insignificant) but also your ESF (that might hurt, depends). If Improved knockdown don't work as intended, then switch those feats for Disarm/ Improved Disarm to get a possible plus to your AB when you swing your Big Axe against people with smaller weapons. And if Intimidate works fiine with your basic 33 ranks (since it is a Will save and thus difficult to make) then take the ESF in Taunt instead.<br/>\n<br/>\n Hope i helped,<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

Other than that, this warrior has been optimized to be a devastating force of nature that will make mincemeat of your opponents in the shortest of times. You already have a very good AB by yourself and you will gain additional AB bonuses each time you make use of your Improved Disarm feat against foes that use small weapons (+4 Vs small, +8 Vs tiny), at the very least against foes with medium size weapons you get to use the feat for free, without taking any AB penalties. Now add to that your severely boosted Taunt skill that is going to reduce your opponents AC by up to 6 points and you will find yourself scoring hits pretty much all the time. If you want to take full advantage of that, then this is the time to use your Power attack feat to make even more devastating attacks!<br/>\n<br/>\n That's all Birey, hope you'll like it ;)</div>"

      "content": "<div>Arelith has some very weird rules when coming to multi-classing darknight, it requires you to take three levels of the class you want one after the other so we can't spread them over for optimal use. Moreover this is a PVP build which that has to be the best at 30th level. By going all 8 Fighter levels in epics i allowed thhe build to have room for Two ESF's <strong>plus </strong>all the necessary feats (EWF, EWS, AS, EP). Finishing as a Barbarian is why this build is so strong, it allows it to maximize <strong>both</strong> Intimidate &amp; Taunt, which is vital to the strategy i posted. Finally Rogue is late teen's because we need at least 21 ranks in Intimidate in order to be able to take the ESF in that, the 17th Barbarian level at the 20th level is for exactly that reason (Taunt) as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n Make no mistake, this is a brutally efficient build at what it does.</div>"
