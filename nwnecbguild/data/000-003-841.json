      "content": "<div>I'm not the best at answering this, as I have limited experience with the Sorcerer class or CoT. But I think I can make a few suggestions that might be helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\n- I think there was a Sorcerer / tank build somewhere in the forum, I will edit the post once I find it to add this in, it would be valuable to look at this<br/>\n<br/>\n- You could fit both Divine Might and Divine Shield into the build, if you take Paladin 3 and Paladin 4 at levels which give you general feats (ie levels which are multiples of 3) but you would have to give up another feat and things look a little tight already.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The Divine shield is Dodge AC. I've found in practice whenever you undertake a non-combat related action you will lose this AC, such as casting a spell, drinking a potion, or recasting Divine Shield again. This is a huge hit and can be very painful :( You may want Expedious Retreat or permahaste to get away, recast your buffs when it runs out (say if you Cha is buffed to 28, that will be every 9 rounds), and return to the fray. Another alternative might be to take use Expertise/Improved Expertise when you are recasting your buffs, if the modules allow it. Some modules will not allow it (for example World of Greyhawk will turn off expertise as soon as you drink a potion / cast a spell).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n- Because of the Dodge AC nature of Divine Shield I would suggest considering single handed weapon and shield just for extra AC from your shield as protection. Your pre-epic BAB will be 13 (-7 AB from 14 levels of Sorcerer) which means you will do 3 attacks per round. If you have Strength 22 when buffed, with three attacks per round, your two handed weapon will mean an extra 9 damage per round, if you hit which you may not (strength damage 6 x 1.5 per hit for two handed instead of 6 x 1 per hit). Whereas your shield AC will usually almost always count. +4AC from a Tower Shield +1 is essentially a -20% chance to be hit for example. Overall the powergamer in me says choose the one handed weapon and shield but I can see how a greatsword would give you extra style points<br/>\n<br/>\n- RE Discipline there was a forum discussion about Epic Skill Focus: Discipline. Mixed Strength Charisma characters could benefit from it in a low magic environment. If its a high magic environment I would consider ignoring discipline, buff up your AC (they need to hit you to knock you down) and/or buy Knockdown immune boots/item. Those 32 skill points could go into something else (such as Heal, Spot - CoT gets this as a class skill, or other skills you might find useful). Or you could drop Int by 2 as well as expertise (to get DM?) and get +1 Cha?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Edit: here are two epic builds, one by Valefor, one by Mick Dagger (Sorc 26/Paladin 4/RDD 10) you might be interested in:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/battle-sorceress-sorcerer-26-pal-4-cot-10-t2354359.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">battle-sorceress-sorcerer-26-pal-4-cot-10-t2354359.html</a><br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/spellsword-of-bahamut-sorc-26-paladin-4-rdd-10-t515415.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">spellsword-of-bahamut-sorc-26-paladin-4 ... 15415.html</a></div>"

It looks pretty cool with a great duration, and is undispellable. +20 AC (+5 dodge, +5 deflection, +5 armor, +5 natural - you can free up ring and amulet slots at the minimum for other properties, and have a wider choice of armor).<br/>\n<br/>\nHis build will normally wear full plate +possible shield? Maybe he could do without empower? There might be some benefit from empowered Bull's Strength etc but is it worth a feat slot in a starved build already... It sounds like the spell casting will be from the still spell feats as a result.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe -7AB from 14 pre-epic sorc levels does bug me - seems rough for a spell sword type build. Need to hit them to do damage. Mick's written previously these are very challenging builds to do well.<br/>\nOne tip I've found helpful is to use the 'Pretty Good Character Builder' module to try out certain builds in the Arena section to see if they are at the minimum, workable. For example, if you can't hit an equivalent level fighter in combat in the arena, fully buffed with appropriate equipment, you will know you will have an attack bonus problem, and have to think about adjusting the build appropriately (by shifting more Sorc levels to epic, if you can). Or if you get knocked down constantly, you know you need more AC / Discipline / Epic Skill Focus: Discipline. Its available from the NWN Vault.\u00a0</div>"

His strength isn't so good to benefi from a two-handed weapon.<br/>\n<strong>Maybe he could do without empower</strong>? <br/>\nOf course he can, but without empower he is missing so many spells &amp; Sorcerers really benefit from slot manipulation on the fly.

Meh, most opponents have AC's in the range of low 20's to 30's, I can quote you some AC ratings from the Wiki if you like, you will not bilieve how barren their defenses are...<br/>\nBesides, he doesn't have to hit everyone's AC, only the grunt types, for the rest he has Arcane power! <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Mick's written previously these are very challenging builds to do well.<br/>\n</strong>The spell-swords? I think he meant the pure spell-slingers. Spell-swords are super-easy since you don't run out of spells, you can grab a greatsword, chuck some potions &amp; hit the thing if you run out!<br/>\nI have done this multiple times with a robe &amp; a greatsword while playing a pure mage, in modules &amp; arenas both.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>One tip I've found helpful is to use the 'Pretty Good Character Builder' module to try out certain builds in the Arena section to see if they are at the minimum, workable</strong>.<br/>\nYes, that's a first step. Then try again but with Tony's A.I. this time. Even then though, the arena has severe problems like lack of any kind of terrain, one-dimensional opponents, very basic builds, etc.<br/>\nSuffice to say that the Arena's level-forty DD only has 10 DD levels...You can see that from his damage reduction. The fighter always has 30 strength &amp; takes Dev. Critical by level 30 &amp; then spams KD &amp; try to Dev. crit you. <br/>\nWith Tony's A.I. they actually try to do called-shots &amp; other stuff at least, but even then, their super-basic builds prevents them to be good opponents. Anyway, some testing at least, is better than no testing, plus it's fun sometimes.</div></blockquote></div>"

      "content": "<div><blockquote><div><cite>Orion2019 wrote:</cite>Mick's written previously these are very challenging builds to do well.</div></blockquote>\nWhat I mean by this is the following:<br/>\nIt is challenging to build arcane spellswords because you want a good AB, a good spell penetration and a high DC for your spells.<br/>\nFor a high AB you want many warrior levels pre epic and a high strength (or dexterity if you want a finesse build). Too many warrior levels in the build challenges spell penetration, and in a level 30 build also undispellability. Too high focus on strength takes focus away from your caster stat with a resulting low spell DC.<br/>\nSo you have to make some tough choices. You can sacrifice AB and make a \"Melee mage\" type character that can melee mobs and saves his excellent spellpower for the boss fights. Or you can sacrifice the spell DC and build up strength and use a reasonable amount of non castrer levels to get a character with good AB and spell penetration. You then get a good self buffer that also has a reliable attack with non save spells. <br/>\nThe challenge is that it is easy to go wrong when balancing out these things unless you know what you're doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother challenge is that your build easily becomes feat starved if you want everything into the build (combat feats, meta magic, auto still, divine feats and great ability feats for two abilities, etc). That is even worse when you build with sorcerer since you have less bonus feats than the wizards have.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy all means these builds work well when done right<br/>\nBut they are harder to get right than the clerics with their 3/4 BAB, no arcane spell failure to worry about and all those AC and AB enhancing spells</div>",

Or even Sorc 26 Paladin 3 Monk 1 (for the evasion feat combined with your sky high reflex saves).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nYou'd drop 3 bonus CoT feats but gain two bonus feats from Sorc 23 and 26, plus your buffs are undispellable apart from Mords and you probably won't have to worry too much about spell penetration with a reasonably high caster level.</div>"
