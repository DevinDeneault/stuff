      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Heya. Been on a hiatus from NWN (thanks to The Witcher 3 and Dark Souls 2) for a while, but I've had this idea bouncing around my head for a bit now. I'd like to go about building something like the Berserker/Druid from BG, but I've been having trouble converting the concept into something workable. I've had two general ideas, one where the Druid spells are used to buff up and go in with melee, or as a shifter-type character. Probably, I could take CoT with the first idea (and end up with something like Max's Terrifying Priest of Kord here on the forums) to boost the saves, but the lack of innate heavy armor proficiency might be an issue. The second would take Shifter, but I have no idea what shapes would work well, or if the various Barbarian rages work in the different forms.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for other \"requirements\", I was planning to run through Aielund for the first time with this guy, so from what I've heard I'll end up nearly level 40 (but I've got nothing against cheating in a couple of levels for the last few fights). Race will probably have to be human, and I think I'll be sticking to the tried and true Scimitar/Tower Shield.<br/>\n<br/>\n If there are any sage sages roaming the boards, I'd love to hear some advice.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Welcome back!\u00a0 I returned myself after a much longer \"vacation\".\u00a0 The game does have a persistent allure, no?<br/>\n<br/>\n Basically, a druid barb will be a gimped cleric barb because NWN druids don't get any buffs even close to their cleric cousins (BG druids are MUCH different), except perhaps Owl's Insight AC boost which is best used in combo with a robed monk combo unless polymorphed, then the armor will merge and the WIS remains.\u00a0 Since you seem set on heavy armor/tower most monk bonus will be lost (including the -3 attack progression unless kama or unarmed, scimi will use -5 progression) and the speed boost as well.\u00a0 All polymorphs will override these limitations with the merge and regain all the monk AC/speed bonuses. Only those shapes using creature weapons will use the monk progression, flurry and stuns, however.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n All <strong>feat-based</strong> actions/spells/spell-like abilities, etc. can be used while polymorphed.\u00a0 That includes raging, bard song, smiting, all the epic spells (again. feat-based), assassin's invisibility, etc... well, you get the picture.\u00a0 Polymorphs can taunt and will tumble out of AoOs among skills that work the same as the native form.\u00a0 It is also pretty funny to see an iron golem bend over to disarm a trap or unlock a door (w/o lockpicks, though). ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n Only dragon shape can achieve a greater attack enhancement than +5 (it's +6) but only its claw attack.\u00a0 The bite has no enhancement unless the caster pre-buffs with a DR buff like Stoneskin/Premonition, then it can penetrate +5 DR.\u00a0 Something like a Rod of the Ghost pre-buff would penetrate +1 DR, Ethereal Visage (if you have UMD/scroll or item) penetrates +3, and so on.\u00a0 These pre-buffs have the exact same effect on any shape using creature weapons, not just dragons.\u00a0 Bears, badgers, elementals, wymlings, dire tigers, gargoyles, etc... same deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n The main weakness of druid shapes is that the item merge is poor.\u00a0 Only magical props of armor, hat and shield merge.\u00a0 Depending on the shape selected, shifter forms will merge all item props except the glove slot e.g\u00a0 Minotaur, drider, commando, Risen Lord, Rak... all these and some others.<br/>\n<br/>\n If you haven't experienced using shifter, it doesn't mean you need to learn all the shapes for a build like this.\u00a0 Just decide on one that seems most suitable and test a few others during moderate challenge opportunities until you reach the target shape... a sort of orientation period for your own edification.\u00a0 I've always liked Risen Lord myself because Undead Shape has no WIS requirement and the early crit immunity is very nice.\u00a0 The only caveat managing undead shape is that you must unmorph to heal since heal pots will have the reverse affect and heal kits are inaccessible while polymorphed, just like any other item (like rods or grenades).\u00a0 Oh, oops, yes... almost forgot... If your undead shape spots a mob of clerics... UNMORPH!\u00a0 They can be turned pretty easily.\u00a0 They can't be killed, but get feared for what seems an eternity.<br/>\n<br/>\n The important thing to remember about the merge is that all sources of AC bonus on items get converted to Deflection so do not stack. The armor/shield rating itself is ignored so a robe with +5 and tower with +3 will result in the same AC (+5 Deflection) as a full plate and tower with the same bonuses. But if you pre-buff with Cat's (and Owl's for a monkish shaper) and wear gear that boosts those abilities, the AC can go quite high.\u00a0 50+ is common for a RL.\u00a0 As far as the weapon goes, it doesn't matter what sort of weapon your caster holds, it will be converted to a scythe and all the magical properties (including the enhancement) are merged onto to the scythe.\u00a0 The minimum (base) enhancement for the RL weapon is +5 so if your toon can get hold of higher enhancements on any kind of weapon (even a dagger or club), they will merge and become a scythe.\u00a0 All the armed shapes work exactly the same way.<br/>\n<br/>\n But check all the shapes and their characteristics before you decide if shifter is a fit you like.\u00a0 Some humanoid shapes are popular.\u00a0 The Commando has been used a lot.\u00a0 Each is fun to experiment with until you reach your personal shape of preference.<br/>\n<br/>\n Consider this a brief intro into the shifter class.\u00a0 In order to make an informed decision for your build, I suggest checking all the available shapes including epic ones, and their prereqs before forming any opinions.\u00a0 The NWNwiki has all you'll need to know regarding shifter shapes and how they might fit into your concept.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I think Shifter is the way to go, even though I have next to no experience with it. Let me look at the forms and mull over it tomorrow. As a knee-jerk reaction, maybe an epic Minotaur which uses some of the unique Barbarian rages is closer to my idea. That said, Risen Lord also looks nice.

All you will need is Shifter 11 which leaves 29 levels for druid/barb. As it turns out, you will also get epic minotaur at the same level so could use it as a secondary shift in the case I noted about the threat of encountering turning classes (like clerics and pallies) with undead shapes.\u00a0 I have an idea how to optimize both shapes in such a build myself and will inject a suitable example for you to consider.\u00a0 In the meantime, install the legacy build search onto your machine and study up on the specifics of how shifting works.<br/>\n<br/>\n Shifter is not only playable, but dominant over most other builds. The only caveat is that the AB can never approach that of a WM or battle cleric so is not suitable for high-magic environments that design creature blueprints with uber AC ratings.\u00a0 I believe Aielund is mid-magic or high mid-magic so a shifter should be fairly effective there.\u00a0 You just need some practice using different shapes until you reach epic levels to begin using your chosen ones.\u00a0 IMO shifter is probably the most fun class to play because there are so many ways to deal with situations and threats.\u00a0 I'll make some suggestions once a build has been hashed out to help minimize some of the experimentation aspects.\n<blockquote><div>I've been trying to get the browser search for the old builds working, but I haven't had any luck.

You can run it locally as long as you use a browser that has Javascript enabled. The details on how to use the archive is contained in the same post with the link.\u00a0 The WoG server that hosted the build search was decommissioned when the host eliminated its free service, ummm, probably 6-8 months ago.\u00a0 The Javascript version works exactly the same and since the archive is comprehensive all builds are accessible.\u00a0 Of course, it won't contain any builds from this site.\u00a0 You'll need to search here using google which is crude but better than scrolling through the entire list.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Then there is Awaken, extremely useful for your pet but TBH, once you begin slicing and dicing with the scythe, the last thing you will be worried about is keeping your companion alive, a companion that will be doing almost no damage compared to your Lord of Terror.\u00a0 Monstrous Regen?\u00a0 Meh.\u00a0 4 rounds of +3HP healing/rnd = 12 HP.\u00a0 Not gonna miss that.\u00a0 Need I go on?\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n When you begin to start to consider which items will enhance your shapes, you will be choosing items like ones with haste, SR, DEX/STR/CON boosts, +saves and any weapon enhancement that adds OnHit damage or other effects like stun.\u00a0 You'll only be able to utilize one item AC boost.\u00a0 It should be the highest bonus you can find.\u00a0 Matters not what kind either.\u00a0 Armor/shield/natural/dodge... they are all converted to deflection so that means the shield may contain a useful enhancement rather than +AC bonus.\u00a0 It doesn't matter what size shield either.\u00a0 Barb is limited to medium armor so look around for one with sweet magical props... like SR &gt; 22 !!! :D<br/>\n<br/>\n The reason I like the number \"Shifter 12\" is because it is divisible by 2 and 3.\u00a0 Many shape special abilities establish effectiveness by Shifter levels/2 or Shifter levels/3 so that number optimizes them. Shifter 18 would be the next one.\u00a0 Also, I plan to invest heavily in detect skills (this in part because Empyre indicated that Aielund uses an advanced creature stealth AI a lot) and need a late dump to Spot.<br/>\n<br/>\n But all this sort of information will be revealed when I publish this and, TBH, as far as I have tested it, it really does look like a beast.\u00a0 It taunts, tumbles, rages, breathes fire... all sorts of tricks.\u00a0 Much kewler than I would have expected so sometimes throwing at a dartboard CAN pay off, eh?<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh... btw... even after your Level 4 Stoneskin 80/+5 buff wears off, your RL will have a permanent 15/+3 DR skin intact, 50% immunity to slash &amp; pierce and +2 vampiric regen which is the main method to keep its HP up without healing... and some other goodies...

Don't know if it would be of any interest to you, but I recently started posting Aielund-specific stuff (not a walkthrough) on the Aielund Saga thread in the Modules section of NWN World in the main menu here. This was precisely because I hadn't played Aielund before - I'd by and large been confined to the OC/SoU/HotU, and I wanted somewhere to bring up any issues that I found. Do please jump in with any you might encounter.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers, and enjoy what looks like a cracker of a build!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
