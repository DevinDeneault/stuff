Does the spell failure from deafness stack with spell failure from taunt?<br/>\n<br/>\n2. A PC equips a small shield (+5% spell failure) but with this property (-50% reduced spell failure). In the character sheet, the chance of spell failure shows 0%. If the PC is taunted and struck deaf, what would be the total chance of spell failure?</div>"

It \"stacks\", meaning that the \"-45\" that is nor being shown on the character sheet (re: it lies) is still present - if one equips, for example, armor with spell failure, that spell failure will be reduced up to -45.<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my SM-G955F using Tapatalk<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>"
