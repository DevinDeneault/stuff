I was kinda looking for something that didnt rely on using scrolls or potions 100 times a battle lol. I have no preference on\u00a0weapons, melee or range nor playability. TY for your time.<br/>\n Here are the changes they did to these spells.<br/>\n<strong>Clairaudience/Clairvoyance:</strong>Grants +5 to spot AND listen.<br/>\n Amplify: Grants +10 listen.<br/>\n True Seeing: The duration is set to 3 rounds.<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">How to make a sneak: High stealth skills and skill enhancing feats including trackless step, small stature, ranger spells like camouflage and one with the land. HIPS for a quick escape. Invisibility spells as a backup.<br/>\n How to make an anti-sneak: High detect skills (spot/listen) and skill enhancing feats. Elf with keen senses. Spells that break invisibility. Permanent true seeing from skin properties e.g. wyrmling or dragon shape.<br/>\n Many builds will be able to have both high stealth skills and detect skills.<br/>\n Shifter has both TS (wyrmling shape) and HIPS (kobold kommando shape).<br/>\n I hope this answers your question.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Good suggestion, Mick. However, Druid Shifters will rely heavily on Dodge AC, which goes away with flat-footedness, so if you can't see them, you're toast. I would suggest a few other possibilities. Dwarven Defenders with Flanking Immunities or any PM combo with EDR will surely get the job done against them. My Versatile Tank build, for example, an EDR Epic Dodger, would be an AWESOME Sneaker and Anti-sneaker. He won't see them, but it won't matter. Another good build is my Underdark Expeditioner as well, Fighter / Rogue / DD who specializes in being the lone sneaker in the room.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Any cleric/druid can have huge spot/listen skills, if you change their race to Elf can also become perma-detect machines campgod.<br/>\n<br/>\n Otherwise take a look at one of my first builds here, i think it will serve you well. Just change his race to Elf and perhaps go for sword &amp; board if you want more ac. This is one of the builds that not only can spot his enemies but also withstand a potential death attack.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>The Halberdier\u00a0</strong></span> ---&gt;\u00a0 <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2350309/THE-HALBERDIER-FTR-12-HS-5-CoT-23#.VVFuCZNS2r9\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/23 ...
