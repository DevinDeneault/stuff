      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">I'm looking to play a Thayan Knight (shocking, I know). \u00a0I'm hoping to hear a few approaches to doing this, and anything a little \"different\" would be especially appreciated. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Quick Breakdown:<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Thayan Knights</strong>\u00a0While the Red Wizards are not opposed to blasting their opponents with deadly spells or shredding the minds of their enemies with dark magic, there are times when they need protectors who have mastered the art of swordplay. These protectors are the Thayan Knights, familiar with magic and loyal to none but the tattooed mages.<br/>\n<br/>\n The Thayan Knights act as bodyguards and enforcers for the Red Wizards and as an extension of their reach. They lead common Thayan troops into battle and help guard the wizard enclaves. Although they are referred to as knights, they have no code of conduct, and the only rule that binds them is that their lives are worth nothing compared to the safety of the Red Wizards. Almost all Thayan Knights are fighters, although monks and rangers have been known to pursue this career. Barbarians are typically too reckless to concentrate on defense, and the Red Wizards consider other individuals too weak for the duties of a Thayan Knight.<br/>\n<br/>\n Race: Human<br/>\n Required Class: Fighter, Ranger, Monk, or Barbarian<br/>\n Base Attack Bonus: +5<br/>\n Skills: Intimidate 2 ranks, Lore 2 ranks<br/>\n Social Status: No slaves<br/>\n Feats: Iron Will, Weapon Focus (longsword)<br/>\n Alignment: Any nongood<br/>\n Special: Sworn allegiance to the Red Wizards of Thay<br/>\n<br/>\n --------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#4C5D77\">1) PvM or PvP - Builds that are maximized for PvM are often not maximized for dueling with other PCs.</span><br/>\n - PvM (PvP can happen, but I don't focus on that sort of thing)<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#4C5D77\">2) Level cap - What is the maximum level that the build (or server) will likely reach?</span><br/>\n - The current level cap is 20. \u00a0Raising the cap into the low epics is possible someday, but this character is unlikely to have to worry about it. \u00a0<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#4C5D77\">3) Race preference - Unless a class demands a specific race or races, Human will be assumed. Otherwise, specify the your favorite.</span><br/>\n - Has to be Human<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#4C5D77\">4) Class preference - Describe which class(es) you have been considering so far and why. Your own concept is key to building what will do the job and be the most fun for you to play.</span><br/>\n - I'm considering tweaking Valerfor's Shadow Knight\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2351793/The-Shadow-Knight-Fighter-6-Rogue-4-Blackguard-10#.U-YVXfldXRm,\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/23 ... -YVXfldXRm,</a> but I wanted to open the door for other possibilities. \u00a0<br/>\n - A fighter base seems the obvious bet.<br/>\n - I'd have no issues with playing a character who was predominantly a ranger, monk, or even barbarian, however. \u00a0<br/>\n - Any sort of multiclass between these classes is fine. \u00a0Rogue splashes would also be viable. \u00a0<br/>\n - I could get away with making a neutral character, so Co(Whomever) is on the table. \u00a0<br/>\n - Aside from ranger levels, no other casting class is an option. \u00a0<br/>\n - I'm not inclined to use weapon master, because the server is undead heavy (along with several other things that laugh off crits and sneak attacks). \u00a0<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#4C5D77\">5) Melee preference - A few options to consider are: dual-wielding vs. one-hand with shield, high AC dexterity-based vs. high-damage strength-based, sneak attacks (stealth), taunting, specialized attacks (e.g. whirlwind, knockdown, called shots, sneaks, death attacks... you name it!).</span><br/>\n - One-hand with shield, strength-based is most likely. \u00a0I don't imagine sneaking up on things is going to be his go-to option, since he's required to throw himself between Red Wizards and danger without self-regard. \u00a0Anything that helps with that would be useful (ie knockdown, taunting). \u00a0<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#4C5D77\">6) Range preference - DEX archery or Zen Archery (WIS) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</span><br/>\n - I don't imagine using a feat on Zen Archery. \u00a0<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#4C5D77\">7) Weapon preference - Which weapon type would you enjoy using the most?</span><br/>\n - Longsword is required unless I wind up with a monk. \u00a0<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#4C5D77\">8) Maximum item enhancement - In the setting where you intend to play this character, what is the highest enchantment (or bonus) that is likely to be used on equipment?</span><br/>\n - \u00a0+2 equipment is common enough, and can be crafted. \u00a0This includes bonuses to ability scores (though it does cost gold and xp). I MIGHT achieve\u00a0<span style=\"color:#000000\">+3 at some point (unless I get REALLY lucky and hit a +4 with something). \u00a0\u00a0</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color:#4C5D77\">9) Spellcasting - If you are requesting a build that is likely to use magic, explain its general use. Will it be used primarily to add enhancements to a physical base attack (i.e. for buffing), to cast strong offensive spells or a balance of both areas of expertise? If arcane-based, would you prefer to be able to cast spells reliably while wearing armor? Is indispellability of buffs an important consideration?</span><br/>\n - This is only an issue if I go Ranger, and ranger spellcasting is pretty straightforward. \u00a0<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#4C5D77\">10) Custom factors - Are there any special conditions that will affect how the build will work where you intend to play it? A PRC server is one example of a custom environment. Many servers have their own modifications to the standard game which will factor into the devising of a solid character build. Also, some community modules set their own rules</span><br/>\n - There's a limit of One prestige class per character.<br/>\n -\u00a0Getting a handful of levels under my belt shouldn't take long, but then it will slow down, so I'm unlikely to get much out of a build that can't survive at early-ish levels. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n - Medium armor gives a ten percent movement speed penalty. \u00a0Heavy armor gives a twenty percent penalty. \u00a0It also takes time to remove or put on armor. \u00a0Running in slow motion does annoy me at times, but mounts are readily available, so at least I wouldn't be a snail in areas where I can be mounted. \u00a0I'll make it work (though I must admit that I've been tempted to go monk heavy at times just for the freedom of moving quickly). \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n - Immunity items are hard to come by, so somewhat respectable saving throws would be nice. \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If so, you've listed the requirements, but not what feats or other specials the class gets.<br/>\n If not, I'll see what I can come up with in a Monk-heavy build. Monk will not only give you high speed but some immunities and good saves. DEX-based would give you better AC while STR-based would give you better damage. I am not saying that Monk is your only option, nor even the best option, but it is an option.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Either or both.  It just can't be a monk/cleric or any of that type of cheese.  Bonus points if it's the sort of cheese I can slide into an existing non-good monk order.  That's not actually enforced on the server, so it's not a deal maker/breaker by any means.  <br/>\n<br/>\n These are the existing, applicable monk orders.  I'm listing them in case anyone wants to try that route, but again, it's not enforced on the server anyway.  The first two would be the most obvious, since the Long Death has a heavy presence in Thay, as does Bane (Iron Gauntlet).  Heavy monk is also good.  <br/>\n Monks of the Long Death may multiclass freely as blackguards, assassins, and fighters.<br/>\n Monks of the Iron Gauntlet may multiclass freely as assassins and fighters.<br/>\n Monks of the Old Order may multiclass freely as rogues, sorcerers and shadowdancers, but must maintain more monk levels than their combined levels of other classes.<br/>\n Serpent Guards can multiclass freely as assassins, fighters and rogues.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks again!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">It appears that you will be in a low-magic environment, so an unarmed Monk will be better than a kama Monk. I suggest Monk 16 / Fighter 4. The Monk gets the best unarmed damage at level 16, 1d20, the most powerful weapon in the game. The 4 levels of Fighter will bring you BAB to just enough to get 1 more attack per round, 6 instead of 5. There is 1 more question before we continue: STR or DEX?
