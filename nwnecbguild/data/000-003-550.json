AC ends up higher that way too. could swap extend for silent spell for more casts of your favorite aoe also. have swapped tumble for persuade or lore, depending on the campaign\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>\n<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></details>\n<em>Edit by Mick Dagger</em></div>"
