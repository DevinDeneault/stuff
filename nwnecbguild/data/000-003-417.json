      "content": "<div>I took buffer/blaster to mean party buffer and then primary source of damage is spells.  With a character like that, I like choosing one or both of my domains to give extra damage spells (e.g. Air and Magic domains) so that I have a wide range of spells both in saving throw type (or in Ice Storm's case no save) and damage type (different elements) across a wide range of levels so that the most effective spell for an area/dungeon can be silented/empowere/maximized.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of domains, I'll assume that there is permahaste, but if not, casting 2 spells is better than any other domain, so take Travel first.  If you really must have Healing take that, but in my example below, I'll use Magic and Air.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure what magic level Amia is, but in a +5 environment, if you can get the Wisdom and Dex capped at higher levels, you're looking at 6 AC higher if you add in Monk like in my build below.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso with regards to spell penetration feats, it's really PW dependent.

If you insist on Healing, take that as well.<br/>\n- if you feel you need the 2 pre-epic spell penetration feats, swap them out for any combination of silent/maximize/lightning reflexes.<br/>\n- I took monk and would plan on eventually going robes/no shield once WIS and WIS/DEX buffs from spells/items makes it worth it.  Even on a 10 STR build, plate and large shield takes up 65 of your 80 carrying weight, leaving you susceptible to becoming encumbered mid-battle on a dispel if you are carrying anything of substance.<br/>\n- I'm not sure how effective the epic spells are on Amia, but dropping WIS from 28 to 26 for two of them (feel free to take mummy dust, etc if those are worth it instead) seems worth it to me.  If not, just go for more Great Wisdoms.<br/>\n- waiting until the end of your build for UMD is another PW-dependent choice as well, mostly on the power and availability of scrolls and items.  If you want it earlier, feel free to change the monk2 to rogue 2 or add another level of rogue in the mix.<br/>\n- The ordering of some of the metamagic might not be quite optimized, I just threw that together here over lunch at work. <br/>\n- You'll have a large choice of AoE damage spells (Call Lightning, Flame Strike, Ice Storm, Chain Lightning, Firestorm, Earthquake, SoV) for you to pick and choose from and at varying levels, so you have a lot of metamagic choice for optimizing your spellbook depending on what type of spell works best.<br/>\n<br/>\nI play  lvl40 version of that only Druid instead of Cleric and it's working out fantastically.</div>"

      "content": "<div>CC/ICC are generally wastes when you can get the same with high concentration and using Defensive Casting combat mode.  Hotkey it to F1 and tap it before unleashing a barrage of spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing to remember is that at higher levels, if enemies have the capabilities to consistently dish out more damage than your concentration check can handle (i.e. 43 + ability modifiers) and the world doesn't have higher level gear with concentration bonuses, you may want to consider epic skill focus in that instead of a 2nd epic spell, if the 10 pts will make a difference.  I don't know Amia but on many worlds with advanced high level gear and bonuses, the 127 max skill check engine limit becomes a factor.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, Darkfire/Flame Weapon in vanilla NWN doesn't affect ranged weapons bc it can't apply to the actual missile being fired instead of the weapon.  Some worlds have custom versions of DF/FW for that, but you should check.  Just because it doesn't affect it doesn't mean you don't have damage increases that work ranged - Divine Favor and Battletide are damage increases that apply to your character not your weapon and I believe they will apply to ranged attacks, but someone correct me, I don't use ranged weapons much on my casters, really just spells.</div>"
