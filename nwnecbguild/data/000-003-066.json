      "content": "<div>Hi! I didn't play much nwn since my OC ranger, but I'm still here :)<br/>\n<br/>\n So, here's the idea: lets make a brute who can HiPS and land sneaks. The very first concept was a Fighter/Ass/SD, then I thought why bother with Ass, I could simply just use Rogue. And then I found this: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/515357/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Faceless</a> by Demos. This is almost the same as my idea, and we dont need a similair build, right?<br/>\n And then I remembered an older idea, a DEX based sneaker Monk with HiPS and max APR (maybe there is something like that in the legacy builds, and this is why I didn't post it.. but I cannot check them right now, so dunno). Change it to STR based, and lets see what can we do with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n We will need Monk and SD, obviously, this leaves only the BG as a third class, if we want 10 APR and sneaks.<br/>\n<br/>\n A very raw build comes here:<br/>\n<br/>\n Human (11 monk / 28 BG / 1 SD)<br/>\n Abilities: 16 STR, 15 DEX, 14 CON, 8 WIS, 14 INT, 8 CHA - everything goes to STR<br/>\n<br/>\n Pre-epic:<br/>\n 10 monk / 10 BG split here<br/>\n 1-8 needs to be monk, after that whatever you want<br/>\n This way we get 17 pre-epic bab<br/>\n Feats:<br/>\n \u00a0- must have: ambidexterity, twf, itwf, dodge, mobility<br/>\n \u00a0- the rest: my first thoughts were SkF in hide and MS, and stealthy, but I dont know if we really need these... expertise, blind fight and weapon focus could be a better alternative<br/>\n<br/>\n Epic:<br/>\n We only have two dump levels here, and we don't have too much options about them. We need that SD asap to get HiPS, and the last monk level alap (as late as possible... are we using this? :D), the rest is BG.<br/>\n Feats:<br/>\n \u00a0- great STR IV, ESkF in hide and MS, epic fiendish servant, epic prowess, armor skin... we dont have too much options with the BG epic bonus feats. EWF and maybe improved sneaks?<br/>\n<br/>\n Skills in general:<br/>\n 247 skill points<br/>\n Hide-MS max (2x43), tumble 40 would be good, a maxed discipline (43) too. What else? We have access to taunt, but we are ugly AF... anyhow, max it too (42). This leaves us with 36 spare points, those could go into spot maybe.<br/>\n<br/>\n So how does it look like? For a moment I thought about make it unarmed. Only 8 APR, but better base damage, but we need more monk levels for this (12 for d12, 16 for d20), wich means weaker sneaks and less bonus feats. It also makes the twf feats unnecessary, so we gain some feats pre-epic. We could even get 20 monk and get all the goodies from perfect self.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Unless I'm missing something, why Blackguard and not Ranger (particularly as you're not use the CHA stuff)? All I can think of is the sneak attack, and I can't remember whether SD gets that or not. You'd get your D-W feats for \"free\", which would give you some more scope for others. If you're going STR-based, then sneak - while lovely - is less needed than for a DEX build imho. You also wouldn't have to be a bad dude - although that might be part of what you want anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, just checked SD, and no, it doesn't get sneak attacks (I could argue why it should, but there's little point).<br/>\n<br/>\n Haven't checked GDL's build, but I do seem to recall reading of a time when several of our Guild members were presenting STR-based assassins (even Max!), and none were what you'd call shabby.<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, just my two-penneth-worth!<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers</div>",

      "content": "<div>I know it is a bit crazy...:) but maybe not that crazy like my other idea (the unarmed barb) :D<br/>\n<br/>\n First, I'm sorry, didn't want to hurt anyones feelings when I said \"why bother with Ass\" :) I'm just not very familiar with that class and I thought a rogue gets everything the build needs and is a bit simpler than the assassin.<br/>\n<br/>\n True, those splits Mick said still secure BAB 17, but in both version I stuck with less BG levels (less than 28), wich means weaker sneaks and less feats.<br/>\n<br/>\n Why BG?<br/>\n \u00a0- BG has a pet, although I don't how how tough it is, but it could help with sneaks<br/>\n \u00a0- free once-a-day bulls str<br/>\n \u00a0- a mildly strong undead turning<br/>\n<br/>\n Drawbacks of BG<br/>\n \u00a0- sadly you get a penalty on your saves with a negative CHA modifier...<br/>\n<br/>\n Is it really necessary to maximise DEX for a sneaky character? I can boost my dex to 26 (+8) with items, and I have ESkF (+10) wich means 61 in the stealth skills. I suppose a regular spotter usually doesn't bother with ESkF and WIS boosting items, so he's around 43 in detecting hiding enemies.<br/>\n Anyway I have a pet who can draw the attention of epic spotters.<br/>\n EDIT:<br/>\n I just checked the mechanics of stealth and detect modes. Passive detecting is only d10+half skill, so even the ESkF in hide and MS seems to be a little overkill against standard monsters. I don't think they are in active search while they are just wandering around. Or am I missing something?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n And lastly, why str based sneaker?<br/>\n Dunno... it just popped into my mind. Happens all the time. See: unarmed barb :D</div>"

      "content": "<div>I checked those BG builds, I like them, but currently I have something else in my mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n Back to the roots:<br/>\n I dropped the monk and BG levels, and tried several other combos with SD (like ranger/ass/sd, ranger/rogue/sd), but was not satisfied with the builds. So I'm here again with the original idea of the ftr/rogue/sd. I checked the faceless build again, and realised, that it is not a dual-wield build. My very first idea was to build something with a big two-hander, make him high STR and give him access to a decent SA, but now I want two weapons, or one double sided instead of one two handed.<br/>\n So I made a modified version of the faceless build.
