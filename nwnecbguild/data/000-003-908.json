      "content": "<div>Alright guys, been playing this one for a while and he packs a wallop. I loved playing the Death Metal Bardbarian so much because I noticed how much easier it was to taunt and knock down fighters when I dropped their concentration and discipline by 10 or so with Curse Song. So I revisited this concept to develop an invisibility flanker that could take advantage of all the combat maneuver / curse song combos. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis build gets full bard undispellability, taunt+expertise out the gate, excellent AB and damage, and full imp KD and disarm. Simply maneuver to your opponent invisible, curse them, then open with KD, taunt-cancel, and then disarm. If you get good at it it is deadly. You are stacking up to -13 to their skills, -11 to their AC, and are buffed yourself. Once their weapon in on the ground simply pummel away with more KD goodness. Refresh Taunt with the expertise/cancel combo when needed. Curse song lasts 10 rounds to start but 100 rounds later on, meaning you can just focus on mocking your opponent into submission. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso Dev crit is nerfed where I play, so might as well enjoy your extra feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreataxe is chosen because it resembles a guitar :) Heavy flail and greatsword are also good picks. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere you go:<br/>\n<br/>\nCombo Bard:<br/>\n<br/>\nBard(24), Fighter(6), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Human<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nSTR: 17 (38)<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 13 (15)<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 14 (16)<br/>\nCHA: 14 (16)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Fighter(1): Expertise, Blind Fight, Weapon Focus: Greataxe<br/>\n02: Bard(1)<br/>\n03: Bard(2): Curse Song<br/>\n04: Bard(3): STR+1, (STR=18)<br/>\n05: Bard(4)<br/>\n06: Bard(5): Disarm<br/>\n07: Bard(6)<br/>\n08: Bard(7): STR+1, (STR=19)<br/>\n09: Bard(8): Knockdown<br/>\n10: Bard(9)<br/>\n11: Bard(10)<br/>\n12: Bard(11): STR+1, Still Spell, (STR=20)<br/>\n13: Fighter(2): Improved Disarm<br/>\n14: Fighter(3)<br/>\n15: Fighter(4): Improved Knockdown, Weapon Specialization: Greataxe<br/>\n16: Red Dragon Disciple(1): STR+1, (STR=21)<br/>\n17: Bard(12)<br/>\n18: Red Dragon Disciple(2): Improved Critical: Greataxe, (STR=23)<br/>\n19: Red Dragon Disciple(3)<br/>\n20: Red Dragon Disciple(4): STR+1, (STR=26)<br/>\n21: Red Dragon Disciple(5): Epic Weapon Focus: Greataxe<br/>\n22: Red Dragon Disciple(6)<br/>\n23: Fighter(5)<br/>\n24: Fighter(6): STR+1, Armor Skin, Epic Weapon Specialization: Greataxe, (STR=27)<br/>\n25: Red Dragon Disciple(7): (CON=15)<br/>\n26: Red Dragon Disciple(8)<br/>\n27: Red Dragon Disciple(9): Epic Prowess, (INT=16)<br/>\n28: Red Dragon Disciple(10): STR+1, {Darkvision}, (STR=32), (CHA=16)<br/>\n29: Bard(13)<br/>\n30: Bard(14): Great Strength I, (STR=33)<br/>\n31: Bard(15)<br/>\n32: Bard(16): STR+1, (STR=34)<br/>\n33: Bard(17): Great Strength II, (STR=35)<br/>\n34: Bard(18)<br/>\n35: Bard(19)<br/>\n36: Bard(20): STR+1, Great Strength III, (STR=37)<br/>\n37: Bard(21)<br/>\n38: Bard(22)<br/>\n39: Bard(23): Epic Skill Focus: Perform, Lasting Inspiration<br/>\n40: Bard(24): STR+1, (STR=38)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHitpoints: 368<br/>\nSkillpoints: 276<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 24/22/19<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9<br/>\nBAB: 26<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 44 (melee), 26 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 23/34<br/>\nSpell Casting: Bard(6)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nDiscipline 43(57), Heal 11(10), Lore 8(35), Open Lock 1(0), Perform 43(56), Spellcraft 43(46), Taunt 43(46), Tumble 40(39), UMD 43(46)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're good with taunt and combat canceling you'll love this guy.</div>"
