      "content": "<div>Hail Luj1<br/>\nThese are interesting thoughts<br/>\nA rogue archer does tries to stays out of the melee so Epic Dodge can be of lesser yield than a dedicated dex rogue meleer<br/>\nTheir AC is also excellent protected by uncanny dodge I and UMD (ie improved invisibility 50% concealment, premonition 30/5+) is available too in case they are hit by melee or ranged attacks<br/>\nI also agree improved evasion and defensive roll are not quite as nice as other options, crippling strike being one, slippery mind (re-roll will save) or skill mastery (setting traps in combat) being a few others<br/>\nI think Epic Dodge is a very powerful ability however. I would lean towards taking it if possible on the off chance I do have to melee with a single handed with possible shield (or dual if I have the proficiencies)\u00a0<br/>\nInterested to hear what others think!</div>"

In my opinion, it is the least worth it on a ranged build assuming the build has the capability of staying at / maintaining range and surviving ranged hits.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat all said, it is hard to offer useful/viable advice without understanding the module.  If everything has a ranged dev crit attack it would be very worth it for example :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>"
