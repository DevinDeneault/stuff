She is rogue 12/Fighter 3/Paladin 2 right now)<br/>\nI am thinking, as a general guide, perhaps once your rogue/assassin/barb levels combine drop 4 levels below your class level or more this becomes an issue<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso could this see the rise of the rogue/barbarian build as the best rogue sneaker build?<br/>\nMore power for half-orcs? :)<br/>\nThe sneaker to end all sneakers? (quite literally *end* them\u00a0<img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" />)<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you guys are having a good time during this rough time.<br/>\nAlso hope we are doing Mick proud with all this sneaker talk.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
