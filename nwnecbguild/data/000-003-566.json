      "content": "<div>Hello all!<br/>\nAs the first sorcerer (caster build) I am playing is running fast to lv 40, I have thought a bit about what to play next: the first promise \"I will never play this\" has been broken (with casters), so it can be an useful thing to increase experience by playing a DEX toon.<br/>\nBards have always had a priority in my NWN adventures, so the DEX pc should be a bard and have epic dodge; in my opinion, lasting inspiration is a must for bard builds; moreover, HIPS can greatly help in the first attempt.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have searched in both new and old ECB guilds, searching for builds that have at least 20 bards and 10 or more levels of shadowdancer, and have epic dodge (rogue builds will be the subject of other adventures). The search showed the following items:\n<ul>\n<li>Pacifistic Minstrel: bard 30 / shadowdancer 10 (elf) by King Ubu: a DEX build that is more focused on maximizing bard song than on melee fight;</li>\n<li>The Imp: bard 20 / red dragon disciple 10 / shadowdancer 10 (halfling) by kreestopearq: STR build with devastating critical, definitely not a DEX build;</li>\n<li>The Harper's Singing Shadow: bard 25 / Harper scout 5 / shadowdancer 10 (human) by sbtedarknight: DEX build, the nearest to my goal but AB 37 should be increased a bit;</li>\n<li>Battlefield Reporter: bard 23 / fighter 1 / shadowdancer 16 (halfling?) by Separ: great support DEX build, as it has not only epic dodge bit also self-concealment, AB is 36;</li>\n<li>Shadow Drake: bard 20 / red dragon disciple 10 / shadowdancer 10 (elf) by The Sneaky Sneaker: STR build with devastating critical, definitely not a DEX build.</li>\n</ul>\n\nOne thing I noticed about DEX builds is that fortitude and will saves are very low. Therefore, after having designed a STR toon:<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Bard(20), Fighter(10), Shadowdancer(10), Human\nSTR: 12\nCON: 10\nINT: 13\n\n01: Bard(1): Blind Fight, Curse Song\n03: Bard(2): Weapon Focus: Shortsword\n05: Bard(4)\n07: Bard(6)\n09: Bard(8): Craft Wand\n11: Bard(10)\n13: Fighter(2): Dodge\n15: Fighter(4): Mobility, Weapon Specialization: Shortsword\n17: Shadowdancer(2): {Darkvision, Evasion, Uncanny Dodge I}\n19: Shadowdancer(4)\n21: Fighter(5): Great Dexterity I, (DEX=23)\n23: Fighter(7)\n25: Shadowdancer(5): {Defensive Roll}\n27: Shadowdancer(7): Great Dexterity III, {Slippery Mind}, (DEX=26)\n29: Shadowdancer(9)\n31: Bard(13)\n33: Bard(15): Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=29)\n35: Bard(17)\n37: Bard(19)\n39: Bard(20): Lasting Inspiration\n\nSkillpoints: 258\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +7, Traps: +2\nAB (max, naked): 41 (melee), 38 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Bard(4)\n\n\n01: Hide(4), Listen(4), Move Silently(4), Perform(4), Spellcraft(4), Save(4), \n03: Hide(2), Listen(2), Move Silently(2), Perform(2), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(5), \n05: Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(2), \n07: Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Perform(1), Tumble(5), \n09: Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Perform(1), Save(4), \n11: Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Perform(1), Save(8), \n13: Save(4), \n15: Save(12), \n17: Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(5), Save(8), \n19: Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Save(18), \n21: Save(4), \n23: Save(12), \n25: Hide(5), Listen(5), Move Silently(5), Tumble(5), Save(4), \n27: Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(5), Save(9), \n29: Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Save(19), \n31: Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Perform(5), Spellcraft(5), UMD(10), Save(7), \n33: Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Spellcraft(3), \n35: Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Spellcraft(3), \n37: Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(5), \n39: Hide(2), Listen(2), Spellcraft(6), </details>\n\nI decided to create something new, that has never been seen before: a DEX bard build as much as possible high saves: fighter has been replaced by champion of torm.<br/>\nRolls of 1 will always threaten this build (like other ones), but there are items with immunities that can be used to prevent fear/death/etc. (if the server/module has some of them); UMD will grant use of scrolls or wands for that purpose, saving precious inventory slots for other aims (for example, DEX cap/damage reduction belts/AC increase).<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the build, for your review:<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Bard(20), Champion of Torm(10), Shadowdancer(10), Halfling\nSTR: 10\nCON: 12\nINT: 14\n\n01: Bard(1): Curse Song\n03: Bard(3): Weapon Finesse\n05: Bard(5)\n07: Bard(7)\n09: Bard(9): Knockdown\n11: Bard(11)\n13: Bard(13)\n15: Bard(15): Improved Knockdown\n17: Bard(16)\n19: Champion of Torm(3): {Smite Evil}\n21: Shadowdancer(1): Great Dexterity I, {Hide in Plain Sight}, (DEX=24)\n23: Shadowdancer(3)\n25: Shadowdancer(5): {Defensive Roll}\n27: Shadowdancer(7): Great Dexterity III, {Slippery Mind}, (DEX=27)\n29: Shadowdancer(9)\n31: Champion of Torm(5)\n33: Champion of Torm(6): Great Dexterity IV, Epic Weapon Focus: Dagger, (DEX=30)\n35: Champion of Torm(8): Epic Prowess\n37: Bard(19)\n39: Bard(20): Lasting Inspiration\n\nSkillpoints: 258\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8, Traps: +2, Fear: +2\nAB (max, naked): 42 (melee), 40 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Bard(4)\n\n\n01: Disable Trap(1), Hide(4), Move Silently(4), Open Lock(1), Perform(4), Spellcraft(4), UMD(4), \n03: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), UMD(1), Save(1), \n05: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), UMD(1), Save(3), \n07: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(5), UMD(1), \n09: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), UMD(1), Save(2), \n11: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), UMD(1), Save(4), \n13: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), UMD(1), Save(1), \n15: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Perform(2), Spellcraft(2), UMD(1), Save(1), \n17: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Perform(2), Tumble(5), \n19: Spot(4), \n21: Hide(4), Move Silently(4), \n23: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(7), \n25: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(10), \n27: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(5), Save(17), \n29: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(29), \n31: Save(39), \n33: Spot(4), Save(1), \n35: Save(9), \n37: Spellcraft(2), Tumble(5), Save(3), \n39: Hide(4), Move Silently(4), Spellcraft(1), UMD(2), Save(2), </details>\nOne can, alternatively, replace halfling with elf and focus in rapier rather than dagger (-1 AB, tweak STR and CON to reach the above initial stats), or replace dagger with mace for (less resisted) bludgeoning damage.<br/>\nAs this build will be tested in WoG server it has craft wand, as it can greatly help having wands of greater magic weapon/bull's strenght/cat's grace/improved invisibility/haste for better playability and help; besides, bard and curse song can be quality of life improvements; the only downside I see now is that uncanny dodge is obtained only at epic levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuffed stats and damage:<br/>\nAC: (34) + capped DEX (6) + bard song (5) + curse song (2) + haste (4) + deflection (5) + natural (5) + dodge (5) + armor (5) + shield (5) = 76 plus dodge feat (1) against last attacker/current target;<br/>\nAB: base 42 + capped DEX (6) + greater magic weapon (5) + bard song (2) = 55 + war cry (2) + curse song (5) = 62<br/>\nSaves vs spells including spellcraft and bard song: (Fortitude/Will/Reflex) 40/37/51<br/>\nDamage: 1d4 (dagger) or 1d6 (rapier) + greater magic weapon (5) + bard song (3) = 1d4 or 1d6 + 8<br/>\n<br/>\nGlad to know your comments and suggestion!</div>"

      "content": "<div>These look nice. Damage for a non sneak dexer and saves are the challenge.<br/>\nIt looks like fighters EWS can boost damage, and CoT can boost saves. One is stuck with having to compromise something.<br/>\nBlackguard helps with both, with Dark Blessing for saves, Divine Might and Shield and a little sneak but that requires 4 feats - power attack/cleave/DM/DS. Combined with the Dodge and Mobility prerequisites for SD and Curse Song, fit in Blind Fight/Knockdown one becomes feat starved and spillage of feats goes out to epics. <br/>\nMaybe of the lot CoT is the best choice here<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd go elf and go rapier rather than halfling for keen senses and better knockdown. I would consider a bard 15 CoT 5 split pre epic so one can get Bard 16 song asap in epics with 30 modified perform requirements. Or even pre epic Bard 12 SD 4 CoT 4 and faster Hips, Evasion, Uncanny Dodge and I believe the saves are better but i haven't done the numbers<br/>\n<br/>\nI also like Str 14 on my dexers for extra carry capacity and extra damage, its the damage from weapon specialization (+2)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could also put Cha to 16 for some level 5 and 6 spells, you won't need still spell in this build with all that dex</div>"

      "content": "<div>Thank you for your observations Orion!<br/>\nI am ok with the race and weapon swift, but maybe not for the pre-epic class split: both 16 bard/4 CoT or bard 15/CoT 5 allow for 16 BAB, however the second proposal will let reflex and will saves diminish by 1.<br/>\nHonestly, CHA has been left as 14 because (based on my experience) level 5 and 6 bard spells have not been used a lot in most cases (only exception is for Betha the divine damage dealer, as Franz gifted her with an armor with 0% spell failure; on the contrary 1 AB is useful against each enemy: I am happy to read bard users' opinion about it, as different.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also like to understand if, given that dexers benefit from high AC (protected by uncanny dodge) and epic dodge, it wouldn't be useful to replace toughness with another feat (e.g. blind fight/silent spell if going for CHA 16, still is less useful as a robe is used in high levels). What do you think about it?</div>"
