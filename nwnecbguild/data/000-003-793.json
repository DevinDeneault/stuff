Got max listen and discipline by dropping UMD to 20. If one doesn't want so much listen, suggest invest into concentration (for taunt resistance), increase UMD to 30 (to equip more cool gear) or cross class into set trap aiming for modified 15 with 1 cross classed point into disable trap to retrieve set traps<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'd think about taking both Blind Fight and Knockdown before taking Power Attack. After all, you have the strength anyway, so you're only taking the feat for its part in the Dev Crit chain really. And max Discipline, don't even think about dropping it - even at the expense of UMD. The only thing worse for a melee build than failing a Will save is ending up on your arse or being disarmed. Those 3 render everything a meleer is designed to do useless - ie, fight. Yes, Spellcraft would be nice - it always is - but not at Disc's expense. Perhaps give your skills schedule a bit more love and attention. I do think you're right to take Epic Prowess rather than Armour Skin here, but it's a possible variant.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nNicely done!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
