Attack<br/>\nDrown<br/>\nElemental Swarm<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>Tips for Gameplay</strong><br/>\nThe first part of your career you are a dedicated caster with some nice defensive boosts from Fighter and Monk.\u00a0 Play as a Druid Summoner, and rely on spells to disable your enemy, such as Grease, Entangle, Spike Growth, Vine Mine, Creeping Doom, etc. Use your powerful summons and your Animal Companion as fodder while you bring the real damage via spells and a healthy sling AB.\u00a0 You get Heavy Armor Proficiency early on to help you until Monk AC can really be useful.\u00a0 At starting levels put your Improved Expertise to work.\u00a0 Tank your oppenents and let your summons flank and overwhelm your enemy.\u00a0 As your spell power grows, you'll find needing this less.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Longterm Buffs</span></strong>: Ultravision, Endure Elements, Barkskin, Camoflauge, One with Land, Empowered Bulls, Owl\u2019s Insight,\u00a0 Stoneskin, Greater Stoneskin, Death Ward, Spell Resistance, Premonition, Prot. From Elements, Energy Buffer, Freedom, Mass Camo, True Seeing<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Short term Buffs</span></strong>: Blood Frenzy (and Extended), Extended Aura of Vitality, Regeneration (and Extended)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Merging</span></strong>: In Dragon Shape, only properties from armor, helmet and shield apply.\u00a0 Seek items for those 3 slots to maximize merging goodness.\u00a0 This is also true for Animal and Elemental Shape.\u00a0 Remember that the Druid is able to easily achieve stat caps with Aura of Vitality (+4 to Strength, Dex and Con), empowered Bulls (+3-7), and Owl's Insight (+12 Wisdom).\u00a0 With just +4 Dex and +4 Con/Str through an armor-related item, you can achieve the cap with potions of Cats Grace and Endurance.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Builder\u2019s Commentary</span></strong><br/>\nThis is one of my Dragon Shape variants that I like to run.\u00a0 It is designed to be played from the ground up.\u00a0 While not the highest AC possible (one could go Monk heavy for an addition 3 AC, or grab 2 more Great Wisdoms for another, this would grant an AC of 103!), this one is fairly close. With a 99 AC (it\u2019s really 97 because of Huge size, but who cares), you insure you can never be critical-ed, or Dev Critted, <em>and</em> you are immune to Sneaks.\u00a0 With over a 1000 hit points, you are what all Dragon Disciples dream of \u2013 an Engine of Irrevocable Destruction.\u00a0 You can reliably hit enemies who have ACs in the 60s and 70s.\u00a0 In order to achieve true form, you are powerful Druid caster for the first portion of your career.\u00a0 Playing a Druid caster is different than playing other casters \u2013 it\u2019s trickier and you have to know your enemies weaknesses.\u00a0 You manage the battlefield with your spells that disable and hamper movement and then bring to bear your summons and offensive spells.\u00a0 Your Zen Archery also comes into play and should allow you to fairly reliably from long range.\u00a0 In the event you come across an opponent who has ACs higher that the mid 70s, turn on Improved Expertise and spam your Breath Weapon.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nI chose not to take ESF: Conjuration in this build because by the time you get it, Dragon Shape is attained and it is no longer needed.\u00a0 Your DCs are still higher than most.\u00a0 <br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nYou get lots of skill points so feel free to adjust accordingly.\u00a0 I found it useful to invest a little in both Hide and Move Silently and allow Druid Camo spell set, along with Trackless Step, to get those stealth skills up.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nFor those that say Dragon Shape is overpowered and banned on their PW, I say this: You\u2019re right.\u00a0 But have you seen the Druid Spell Lists? Pitiful to say the least.\u00a0 While there are some winner spells, many are vastly underpowered and schemed for a Level 20 environment.\u00a0 Dragon Shape, in my opinion, was the NWN creators way of throwing them a bone for hosing them with spells.\u00a0 Like why no Cat\u2019s Grace?\u00a0 Anyway, I digress\u2026<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nFinal Note: If one wants to avoid XP penalty, just go with a Fighter4/Monk4 split.\u00a0 You lose IKD but now you can use the 3<sup>rd</sup> fighter bonus feat for Armor Skin and free up a Druid Bonus feat for ESF: Conjuration.\u00a0 I\u2019d rather have the 1 AC and IKD, but that\u2019s me.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nOther builds with same Classes.\u00a0 Only 4:<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build179427.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nice Forest Guy</a>:\u00a0 (weird Strength-based one)<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build187089.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Iconic Druid</a>:\u00a0 (not as powerful)<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/buildsearch/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dragon Druid</a>: (no longer legit build)<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/oerthblood-druid-28-fighter-6-monk-6-t515335.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Oerth Blood</a>: : Perhaps the closet in concept to the World Ender, it is Druid28/Ftr/6/Monk6. \u00a0Lesser caster, with emphasis on longbow<br/>\n<br/>\nThe AC listed below is fully buffed with Improved Expertise and a few +4 items.\u00a0<br/>\n<span class=\"inline-attachment\">\n<dl class=\"fileimage display\">\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/202003/10758933_6901ac5d4feb6d91ba453490e76b6fc6_t.png\" />\n<dd class=\"file-comment\">The World Ender - In case anyone doubts</dd> </dl>\n</span><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It takes the Dragon Shape power of really high AC to the next level, so Kudos for that! My question to you (especially on WoG) is: \"what misses this build with 99 AC that would hit it with 92 AC, or even with 87 AC? How much of that AC is just part of the concept, but in practice redundant?\"<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience, with my Champion of the Wilderness build, I was having much more trouble hitting some really high AC enemies than getting hit by anyone. Yes, it's really good to use that Breath Weapon with 99 AC if the enemy doesn't have Evasion, and you can't hit it with melee attacks, but I've always found it harder to hit opponents than to be hit by them.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
