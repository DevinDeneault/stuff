I recently got NWNEE on the Nintendo Switch and have been wanting to make a build that emulates the Gloomstalker. The goal was to have a toon who was great at stealth, but could also hold her own in melee combat. This build was made with level 40 in mind, but it's definitely playable PvM 1-40. However, be wary of the 20% XP penalty for most of the build.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis build goes heavy on stealth while (hopefully) still retaining an ability to combat crit/sneak immune enemies with Bane of Enemies and a high AB/AC. This build should also do well in PvP with adjustments to the favored enemies.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI did not think it necessary to spend skill points in spot/listen, since rangers get Invisibility Purge as a 3rd level spell.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI chose Elf over Halfling mainly because Keen Senses allows me to always stay vigilant for traps, and between Camouflage and One with the Land (and occasionally Trackless step) I will have enough bonuses to stealth for the Halfling bonuses not to matter. The stealth skills might seem excessive, but the build had PvP in mind, and I also wanted the luxury of being able to HiPS and switch gear without worrying about being spotted. Because of the 23 levels of ranger, it is possible and important to self buff after a rest (Ultravision, Cat's Grace, One with the Land, Protection from Elements).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThis build plays as a scout and assassin, but able to fight toe to toe if stealth is not an option.<br/>\n<br/>\n---\u00a0 \u00a0---\u00a0 \u00a0---<br/>\n<br/>\nGloomstalker (Ranger 23/Rogue 16/Shadowdancer 1)<br/>\nElf, Any<br/>\nPvM (1-40), PvP (40, untested)<br/>\n<br/>\nABILITIES:<br/>\nSTR: 8<br/>\nDEX: 20 (34)<br/>\nCON: 10<br/>\nWIS: 14<br/>\nINT: 12<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\nBASIC STATS:<br/>\nHitpoints: 334<br/>\nSkillpoints: 293<br/>\n<br/>\nBAB: 29<br/>\nAB (naked, favored enemy): 40/42<br/>\n<br/>\nSaving Throws (for/ref/wil): 21/31/18<br/>\n+2 mind-affecting spells (racial)<br/>\n+3 traps (uncanny dodge IV)<br/>\n+4 spells (spellcraft)<br/>\nSleep Immunity (racial)\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAC (naked/dodge): 32/33<br/>\n<br/>\nLEVELING GUIDE<br/>\n01 Rogue (1): Dodge<br/>\n02 Rogue (2)<br/>\n03 Ranger (1): {Dual-Wield}, Weapon Finesse, FE: Undead<br/>\n04 Ranger (2): DEX +1 (DEX=21)<br/>\n05 Ranger (3)<br/>\n06 Ranger (4): Mobility<br/>\n07: Rogue (3): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br/>\n08: Ranger (5): DEX +1 (DEX=22), FE: Construct<br/>\n09: Ranger (6): {Animal Companion}, Blind-Fight<br/>\n10: Ranger (7)<br/>\n11: Ranger (8)<br/>\n12: Ranger (9): {Improved Two-Weapon Fighting}, DEX +1 (DEX=23), Skill Focus: Hide<br/>\n13: Ranger (10): FE: Elemental<br/>\n14: Ranger (11)<br/>\n15: Ranger (12): Skill Focus: Move Silently<br/>\n16: Ranger (13): DEX +1 (DEX=24)<br/>\n17: Rogue (4)<br/>\n18: Ranger (14): Stealthy<br/>\n19: Ranger (15): FE: Dragon<br/>\n20: Ranger (16): DEX +1 (DEX=25)<br/>\n21: Shadowdancer (1): {Hide in Plain Sight}, Great Dexterity I (DEX=26)<br/>\n22: Rogue (5)<br/>\n23: Rogue (6)<br/>\n24: Rogue (7): DEX +1, Great Dexterity II (DEX=28)<br/>\n25: Rogue (8)<br/>\n26: Rogue (9)<br/>\n27: Rogue (10): Defensive Roll, Armor Skin<br/>\n28: Rogue (11): DEX +1 (DEX=29)<br/>\n29: Rogue (12)<br/>\n30: Rogue (13): Improved Evasion, Epic Dodge<br/>\n31: Ranger (17)<br/>\n32: Ranger (18): DEX +1 (DEX=30)<br/>\n33: Ranger (19): Epic Skill Focus: Move Silently<br/>\n34: Ranger (20): Epic Prowess<br/>\n35: Ranger (21)<br/>\n36: Ranger (22): DEX +1, Great Dexterity III (DEX=32)<br/>\n37: Ranger (23): Bane of Enemies<br/>\n38: Rogue (14)<br/>\n39: Rogue (15): Great Dexterity IV (DEX=33)<br/>\n40: Rogue (16): DEX +1 (DEX=34), Epic Skill Focus: Hide<br/>\n<br/>\nSKILLS<br/>\nDisable Trap: 38 (39)<br/>\nHide: 43 (70)<br/>\nMove Silently: 43 (70)<br/>\nOpen Lock: 11 (23)<br/>\nSearch: 39 (42)<br/>\nSpellcraft (cxc): 19 (20)<br/>\nTumble: 40 (52)<br/>\nUse Magic Device: 41 (40)<br/>\n<br/>\nDisable trap is at 38 (endscore 39) so that I don't whiff a recovery of an epic trap, and can also disable them.

Just one little typo - you get your animal companion at Level 9, not 6, as it comes with Ranger L6. Oh, and for the Spellcraft skill, just label it as 19 (20), as you've already told folk it's cross-classed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have a couple of questions-cum-thoughts for you, though. I'm assuming you'll be relying on sneak attacks for the majority of your damage output, given that you don't invest in setting traps, yet you don't take either of the Knockdown twins, which would generate so many more sneaks for you? I know Bane gives +2d6 damage, but you've only got 4 FEs and you take BoE at L37 in any case. It just worries me a little. Also - though this might be entirely deliberate - you don't take a Weapon Focus and EWF for +3 AB? I know you want to elevate your stealth skills, but you do say you want Gloomstalker to be able to stand toe-to-toe, and I wonder how that's going to work currently - particularly against enemies with True Seeing. My temptation might be to lose the skill foci in Hide and Move Silently, as well as their epic cousins, and replace them with WF in Rapier or Shortsword and KD, then EWF and Crippling Strike for your final Rogue bonus feat. But that might just be me.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't pretend to be an excellent stealther, so others may well have more informed views. Regardless, good to meet you.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thank you so much! I\u2019ll keep that in mind with crossclassed skills! I double checked, I definitely should have put that on level 9, thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought long and hard about KD/IKD, and decided that HiPS would fulfill my sneak attack needs. I also have animal summons and my animal companion to proc sneak attacks (I chose panther, so either way it\u2019s more damage). The FE\u2019s were for enemies who were immune to sneak attack, and BoE was more just icing on the cake. I\u2019m used to playing games a lot slower because of my play style, and I don\u2019t mind a longer and more tedious slugfest (due to high AC and epic dodge, I should still beat most things, right?). <br/>\n<br/>\nI also decided that because I have HiPS, I\u2019d be catching most foes flatfooted and to forgo WF and EWF. Tbh, Epic Prowess is there as a nice way to round my AB to 40. Against foes I don\u2019t catch flatfooted, BoE will add a +2 AB anyway, and I have Aid as a ranger spell. Also, I realized I had to choose to be phenomenal at stealth or at combat, and decided to go the stealth route and just be able to survive a fight, not dominate it. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother reason I didn\u2019t take WF was for the fact that I can switch damage types. True, I mainly dual wield short swords, but against resistant enemies it\u2019s handy to be able to switch to axes or maces. And I\u2019m kind of a purist, so I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m cheating on my weapon if I have to use a bow to draw aggro or sneak attack from a distance.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow much stealth is too much? Because I wanted this to be PvP viable I tried to max it out. As I mentioned before, against True Seers I have animal summons and my companion, as well as the good ol\u2019 corner sneak method. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for replying and checking the build out!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
