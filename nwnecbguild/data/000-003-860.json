Is there a reason the combination is not viewed favorably around here?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm probably looking for something like Fighter/Bard/CoT for the weapon specialization line of feats, preferably BAB 27-29 range (so not too many Bard levels, although I could be won over by the benefits of Bard16 with BAB26), and skills to fit an Aielund playthrough.<br/>\n<br/>\nRDD builds need not apply. Have at it, if you will!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Would that be of any interest? It should work fine for Aielund with a little jiggling. It's a 29 BAB build with a greatsword.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're keen on getting WS/ EWS, maybe something like a Fighter 6/ Bard 16 or 20/ CoT 14 or 18 could work? Bearing in mind that Aielund will finish at about level 36-7, so you're pretty well guaranteed to lose a general feat (L39) and the stat bump at L40.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, does Bard still attract extra skill points in the EE version of Aielund?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

In a nutshell, it's all over the place; some changes are understandable, but others are from a wild mix of 3.0e (which NWN1 was based on), 3.5e, and some random changes that follow neither editions nor bioware's implementation (intended or otherwise) and imo have little justification. I'm sure the author had his reasons, but the overall tone/philosophy that's conveyed by his notes combined with the fact his documentation at times is inaccurate or misleading ('per PHB' even though it's clearly not the case at times) was rather offputting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the welcome Stagmeister; I did see the barb/bard/CoT thread and was intrigued, but in the end decided I'd prefer fighter for WS/EWS. I also like having as feats as possible/varied tactical options to represent a smart, skilled fighter vs pure brute force, part of the reason I'm not fond of RDD builds (aside from having developed a distaste for them from seeing scores of of min/max RDD clones running around PWs). The F6/Bard16/CoT sounds promising. Are there any specific builds here I've missed or do you have something in mind?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You need to be maxing Discipline, Tumble (40 unmodified ranks), UMD (where possible - certainly up to a modified 33), and a perception skill (Listen or Spot). That's about 160 points. Then, for a Bard, you need some Perform for the song, so you're up around 175/180 points. It's rare to have a melee build with many more than 200/220 points, so it becomes a contest between Concentration and Spellcraft (and maybe Taunt if classes permit), both of which have their merits. In Empyre's particular build, you need to use 8 points to get the 4 Intimidate required for WM as well. Craft Weapon has a particular use in Aielund, too, so there's not much scope left. In a CoT build, rather than a WM one, you're going to have much better saves, so the lure of Spellcraft is lessened somewhat, but is still hard to ignore. It's the old \"you can't have everything you want,\" problem again.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> @ Valerfor - Looking forward to seeing the results of your endeavours!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Definitely adds a certain flair (as well as being mechanically useful) which I like. I might be tempted to raise the Dex some and maybe knock down CHA a bit mainly for flavor if it doesn't mess things up too badly (looking at the picture provided I just don't see Dex 8!). Also makes me wonder if 14 INT is really needed for a CoT build (though I realize the effectiveness of Expertise in tight spots - love me lots of skills but can live with a bit less if s/he's a stunningly effective combatant... alas, can't have it all indeed) vs say a WM one which requires minimum 13.\u00a0<br/>\nI also play with EMS disabled for the most part which means Eagle's Splendor lasts hour/lvl per NWN/3.0e rather than the 3.5e version EMS modded to; NWN stacking rules means a 14 CHA will hit 20-22 range by Ch1 for a decent stretch... good enough perhaps for the smites? Most CoT builds I've seen here don't seem to emphasize CHA/smites at all actually, with many base CHA 8 builds, giving me the impression it's seen as a bonus but not\u00a0 a vital contribution. Am I forgetting about something besides smite (and lay on hands, which really doesn't seem that big a deal if it's not a heavy CHA/pallyCOT build) that CHA14 rather than 16 would impact significantly?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
