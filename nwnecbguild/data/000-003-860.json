      "content": "<div>Thanks Mik.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. What I want toon to be good at.<br/>\n<br/>\nA. Primary: Assassin, dex, stealth. Good, but not 25 to 30 levels good. 21 levels, while not great, awesome, is not bad, is at least semi good. Death Attack should still work for some to almost a lot of things. But there will be a couple, few, some things that will resist death attack. Hence Plan B. Also 21 levels is as high as can get since need at least 10 levels cleric, 9 levels Ranger.<br/>\n<br/>\nB. Secondary; A tie between dex fighting with semi almost lots, more attacks per round(due to Ranger 2 weapon path, haste(UMD, cleric), and cleric buffs to enable, support secondary.<br/>\n<br/>\nC. Third: When Stealth, Death Attacks dont work, Cleric Spells, Ranger Druid Spells. Also Damaging Cleric Spells like Ice Storm(Magic Domain), and can Dex fight, melee, ranged.<br/>\n<br/>\nD. Ability to use summon animals, animal companion, to buy time to either stealth death attack, help fight, or cast a damage spell like Ice Storm.<br/>\n<br/>\nE. Semi Balanced. Not looking for a jack of all trades master of none, or jack, master of trades. When I say Semi Balanced a semi balance between the things that do semi good, that can find a way to win, based on if something doesnt work, something else probably, might will.<br/>\n<br/>\nF. Want Toon to be able to do well both in Solo, or Party.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeaknesses: <br/>\n<br/>\nAm ok with: Lower damage output(until get good higher buffs for str, damage, until get Ice Storm, etc). Balanced by higher AB, AC, more attacks per round, death attack, Stealth, etc<br/>\n<br/>\nDeath Attack DC. Almost Semi Weakness, but still ok. But ok, balanced by ability to fight, Ice Storm, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nDont have access to(except thru UMD)to higher level Cleric Spells, including highest lev, better buff spell, like Harm, Heal, Blade Barrier, Firestorm, etc. But balanced by Death Attack, Stealth, Fighting Ability.<br/>\n<br/>\nLower Con, hp total<br/>\n<br/>\nDoesn't Turn Undead Well, due to 8 Cha.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to what class changes. Only change to Assassin. Gets HIPS at 8th Level, as normally have to take Shadowdancer to get HIPS.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to your other question. I dont remember if can reset, de level, re level.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll check. But good chance 1st 8 levels set, cant be undone.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the rest isnt set in stone, at least not yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can probably implement some, most changes discussed here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome to almost a lot of discussed changes I would use, a couple, few, some I may not use.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think helping this build, posting this build here, and then posting a finalized OPTIMIZED version, variant of this build in the finalized, optimized level 40 area, by you Mick, Stag, Valerfor, etc would be good, because I think this build idea has a lot of potential, and because thru searching builds, didnt see hardly any build ideas like this one, or even any variant, sub version like this one.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your comment, help.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hi Asturo<br/>\nYou combine 3 classes that all benefit from having many levels.<br/>\nElf has none of them as favored class and will suffer an xp penalty unless you keep Ranger and Cleric levels close. But if you do that, both classes will suffer because they both get better with many levels.<br/>\nRanger 9 is often used for the dual wield feats. The lvl 9 animal companion will be far to weak when you level up. Ranger has the class skills to qualify early for Assassin, so those two classes match well.<br/>\nCleric is a caster and a self buffer class. With only 10 levels you cannot rely on the buffs because they are so easily dispelled by enamy casters. Many of the Cleric buffs \"mature\" at lvl 15, and many builders consider 15 levels of Cleric as a minimum in a self buffer build. The spells of a low level Cleric will be easily resisted, so don't count on attack spells with such a build. Turn undead will also be too weak.<br/>\nThe only reason you give for not taking assassin to near 30 levels is that you want to make room for the other classes, and that can be fair enough if you want another focus than the Death attack.<br/>\nWhen you answer what you want the character to be good at, I read things like; back up plan, semi good, and a lot of different things and I hardly see a focus.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several ways to build versatile characters. But you still need to focus on how the character can survive when the going gets tough.<br/>\nThe three classes you have chosen all have great potential. If you want an optimized build, or something close: Drop elf if you want both cleric and ranger. If you want Elf: Go heavy on Cleric with Assassin as a minor tumble class. You may also go light on Ranger and heavy on Assassin for Dual wield and a strong Death attack, or heavy on Ranger for a high bonus vs FE and BoE and light on Assassin for tumble and HIPS. But all of that probably means starting a new character.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe elven Ranger 9/ Cleric 10/ Assassin 21 is not ideal, but possible to play. HIPS helps. But both Cleric spell casting and Assassin Death attack and bonus feats would benefit greatly from more levels.</div>",

      "content": "<div>Thanks Mick for your breakdown.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand why 15 levels of clerics. I just dont see the room for 9 levels of Ranger, 15 levels of cleric, and at least 19, 20, 21 levels of Assassin.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat means Assassin would have to be 16 levels, to go with 9 lev Ranger, 15 level Cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat would weaken the Assassin.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso going to 7th, 8th lev spells, makes Wisdom having to be to high, takes points away from Dex<br/>\n<br/>\nSome other possible splits could be 6 lev Ranger, 14 lev Cleric, 20 lev Assassin.<br/>\n<br/>\nProb with that, Animal Companion weak, less spells, and no classed based inproved 2 weapon fighting feats, unless take the feats, and probably even Human with extra feat, not enough feat slots to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould go with 9 levels of Ranger, 12 levels of cleric, 19 levels of Assassin.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile not quite 15 levels of cleric, its close, closer to 15 levels of cleric, gives 6th lev spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd 19 levels of Assassin, is what I would think as minimum to be ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould go 9 lev Ranger, 14th Lev Cleric, 17th lev Assassin.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat would give 7th lev spells, would be absolute highest for cleric, but prob is taking wisdom to 17 taking points away from dex.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso 17 levels of Assassin, might or might not be ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso if clerics get 7th level Spells at 13th lev(not sure, dont think so, but got 7th lev spells at 13th lev in 2nd ed D&amp;D), then 9th lev Ranger, 13th lev Cleric, 18th lev Assassin might or might not be ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo which split should be done?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me, I think 9th lev Ranger, 12th lev Cleric, 19 lev Assassin is ok, optimal.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless someone can sell me, everyone else on why, how 9th lev Ranger, 14th lev Cleric, 17th lev Assassin is optimal, and if 17 levels of Assassin ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I'm ok with the 25% Xp penalty, that by itself is not that big a deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts when combined with losing extra feat, skill points.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe build needs extra feat, skill points.<br/>\n<br/>\nStarting with 20 Dex is nice, but prob not worth the prob of 1 less feat, less skillpoints in this build, which I have started to notice in both planning, and in play.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I probably will start over. My level is low enough at 10th level.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus its a faster leveling PW at Arkhalia<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think I will go with Ranger 9, Cleric 12, Assassin 19, unless I can be convinced to go with 9 Ranger, 14 Cleric, 17 Assassin.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso when I start over, I'll post what each level up is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know that would be 40 levels of 40 post, but its the only way, as I am just not good at remembering what I did over multiple levels, and not that good at specifically, exactly planning out each level.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, thanks for your comment, breakdown, help, and for any future help.</div>"

There is a way to post level by level breakdowns, in 1 post.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. That I dont follow, do that, because I suck at doing that, because I HAVE A VERY HARD TIME BOTH REMEMBERING, PLANNING EXACT SPECIFIC LEVEL BY LEVEL DETAILS OF EITHER WHAT I DID, WHAT I WANT TO DO AS FAR AS LEVEL BY LEVEL STAT INCREASES, HP, BAB, AB, SKILL POINT ALLOTMENT, FEATS.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome like Mick, Valefor, Stag, others can tell you, breakdown the exact number of specific skill ranks, feats, things, etc, that they will take at each of the 40 levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr if they dont do that, they can play, build a toon to 40th level, then remember, give a exact breakdown of what they did at each level.<br/>\n<br/>\nI SUCK AT DOING THAT.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best I can do is give a GENERALISTIC, borderline between semi specific, semi exact, and semi NON specific, plan on what I would roughly may do at some of the levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did post something like that at the beginning of thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso at most I might be able to semi remember and only report what building every 2,3,4 levels, instead of each level.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if I do that, I might probably misremember, forget, get some things wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only way I would, can, will be more accurate is to report what do to build every level, and sometimes every level.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow the reason why doing all this is for following Reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. So that Mick, Valefor, Stag, can see what building, and RECONSTRUCT IT, PUT ALL THE INFO INTO THE FORM THEY USE TO POST A BUILD, SO THAT THEY CAN POST THIS BUILD.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. As to why reason number one:<br/>\n<br/>\nA. So that can get help, advice, etc on build.<br/>\n<br/>\nB. To OPTIMIZE build.<br/>\n<br/>\nC. And when build is done up to Mick's, Valefor's, Stag's, etc, standards of optimization to post the finalized finished build somewhere in Forum, either in Level 40 section, or yardstick.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the reason for that, is that I have not seen very many builds like this in searching seeing builds. And I think this build has a lot of potential. And some others also think so as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo because of that, a optimized version of build might good to post.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Also another reason for this, is sometimes its nice for someone to post what they are doing as they are doing it, step by step, report by report, instead of after they did it, or instead of what they plan to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo thats why I am doing what I am doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I disagree with you about you saying this is not a good way to ask for help, critique, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it is ok, IF AS LONG AS THEY GOTO BEGINNING SEE THE ORIGINAL POST, POSTINGS, AND THE CONSTRUCTIVE COMMENTS BY OTHERS BETWEEN THE REPORTS, AND IF COMMENTERS ARE NOT THE TYPE TO NOT READ THE BEGINNING, AND ANY CONSTRUCTIVE IN BETWEEN REPORTS COMMENTS.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut whether you agree or not, whether tou like it or not, etc, I am still going to do it this way for the reasons I said.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut thanks anyways for your comment.</div>"

It has what classes at each level, what each stat increase will be, and where, when at each stat increase level(4,8,12,16,etc), a couple, few, some exact, specific feats to be taken at either exact, specific levels, or within a range of levels.But has nothing on about skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nI combine that planning with the ability to wing the rest on the fly. I can do that because I have a rough idea what it would look like, and a rough idea of where stuff should go, and where stuff should not go, and what is bad, what is good.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso a lot of that ability has come from building, playing about 75 to 150 characters in pen and paper on the fly, winging it, where highest level character was a 80th level character with 20 Lev Bard, 20 Lev Cleric, 20 Lev Rogue, 20 Lev Fighter.<br/>\n<br/>\nI may not perfectly optimize that way, but I can come semi somewhat semi close to semi optimization, at times.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso the reason why reporting what do at each lev up, in implementing my basic rough plan, as I play, wing it on fly a little, is so that you stag, Valefor, Mick, others can see what I have done, then post it in the nice spreadsheet form you, others do, use, and then use that to help review, optimize it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that I can remake character by making another character, following the tweaked, changed, optimized posted build, while playing it on Arkhalia.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat means 80 levels of playing. <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst 40 levels, reporting what do so that can have have the build posted, reviewed, optimized.<br/>\n<br/>\n2nd 40 levels, playing the optimized build.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat probably not best way.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut since I can't plan, post a specific, exact level vy level build in spreadsheet form, its probably the only way that would work for me.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hi Asturo, I've a few little snippets for you, if that's ok?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first thing that strikes me is pre-epic feats. It appears that you're not intending to take Blind Fighting or Knockdown (thus also not Imp Knockdown). I would suggest that those 2 are must-haves (there's very little point casting Darkness over a mob if you can't use it to inflict Death Attacks all over the place), and you should drop the idea of Whirlwind Attack and Imp Expertise for them asap. I would have suggested dropping Mobility as well, so you could take all 3, but we've missed the boat on that one.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn epic levels, you'll be wanting Epic Weapon Focus, Armor Skin and Epic Prowess, leaving you with 4 more general feats for stat increases to go with the 10 attribute bumps you get throughout the build - but don't forget that you'll get a bonus feat at Assassin 14, which you could use for another Great Dex. That could mean a final Dex of 28 (+9) and Wis of 18 (+4). However, I notice you're not planning to take any Cleric-enhancing feats, so am guessing you plan to use the class for buffs more than anything, so a final Wis of 16 should be enough, allowing for another 2 points in Dex (taking it to 30).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich brings me to my next point, which is about the class spread. Currently, your pre-epic split seems to be Ranger 8/ Cleric 3-5/ Assassin 7-9. Given that keeping pre-epic BAB at 15 or below to maximise the use of Divine Power is another ship that's already sailed, we might as well go for the best BAB we can, which (following the Rule of Four) would be Ranger 8/ Cleric 4/ Assassin 8 - giving a BAB of 17, where R8/C3/A9 and R8/C5/A7 both give 16.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn epic levels you plan on only take one level of Ranger (at level 21), yet you've been putting skill points into Discipline. Now, there's a long-standing debate about the merits of taking Discipline in Dex builds which doesn't need re-hashing here, but if you're going to take it, you really need to max it - which you won't be able to do as it stands. My temptation would be to take 2 levels of Ranger in epic (10 in total): the first at 21 (or thereabouts), and the last at 40 for a final discipline dump (and another Favored Enemy iirc). Now, of course, that makes 41 levels, which is impossible. However, if you take 18 levels of Assassin you gain another bonus feat (maybe a further Great Dex, which would mean you could take one Int as a stat bump, taking you to 14 for more skill points. I would have said start with 14 Int, 17 Dex, which would have allowed for a boost to either Con or Str as well, but yet more sails over the horizon). That would mean dropping Cleric down to 12. In the grand scheme of things that won't matter too much in a non-Cleric-heavy build - you'll still be easily dispelled and offensive spells will still be a bit sucky - but it will help the overall build.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as skill points go in the build as it stands, and depending on how many levels of Cleric and Assassin are taken, you end up with 230-234 in total. Now, we need to put 40 points in Tumble, at least 34 in UMD, 43 in Hide, 43 in Move Silently, at least 39 in Spellcraft, and 43 in Concentration. That's 242. More than we have available already, and that's without any Discipline, Listen or Spot, let alone Animal Empathy, Search, Disable Trap and Open Lock. \"Houston, we have a problem\"...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I'll let you have a think about all this, then we'll see what we can do.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope you don't mind!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT:</strong></em> Oh, and by the way, I don't use the spreadsheet, I type all my builds in here directly, following the posting Guidelines.</div>",

      "content": "<div>Must Say, this is a very tricky, combination build.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for comment Stag.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll see if there is a re leveler. Hopefully there is one. If not I will start over.<br/>\n<br/>\nNoticed even before your comment that problem with skills, lack of skill points, needing more skill points.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout blindfight, knockdown path, you talked about:<br/>\n<br/>\nWas planning on taking Blindfight, either after improved Critical, some other feat. I always grab the more inportant feats 1st before Blind Fight and save Blind fight for feat levels 9, 12,15, etc)<br/>\n<br/>\nStr is 10. Even if use good magic items, potions, spells to pump str up, not sure its worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Starting Str were 14 to 18, I could see knockdown being useful, because then with Buffs, etc, str would be high 22 to 30.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut at 10 starting strength, not likely to be able to knockdown.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso dont need knockdown to death attack. If use darkness, hide, can still easily death attack without knockdown.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I am wrong, and knockdown path important enough, I can still take all 3, blindfight, Knockdown, improved knockdown, and only give up improved expertise.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know its not good to take a pre epic feat in epic levels, but if have to take 1 pre epic feat in epic levels to be able to have all 3, blind fight, knockdown, improved knockdown, then so be it.<br/>\n<br/>\nMobility gives +4 against attacks of opportunity. Very useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso if I dont take Mobility, I need to not take Dodge.<br/>\n<br/>\nDodge is almost married to Mobility. If you take Dodge you should take Mobility.<br/>\n<br/>\nA feat slot is not worth ONLY +1 dodge bonus to AC. The only reason to take it, is to take Mobility.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if Mobility goes, Dodge goes too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout Skills, skill points:<br/>\n<br/>\nI think stats need to be Str 10, Dex 18, Con 08, Wis 12, Int 14, Cha 10, Human.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat would give me 28 start skill points, 60 Ranger Skillpoints(4 +2 int x 10th lev = 60), 108 Assassin Skillpoints(18 lev), 48 Cleric Skillpoints<br/>\n<br/>\nTotal Skillpoints: 244 Skill Points<br/>\n<br/>\nThink I can sacrifice discipline, because if death attacking, wont need discipline. And even if not death attacking, not every monster, humanoid, bi pedal enemy has disarm.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan sacrifice Search, Disable Device, Open Lock, even tho I would like to be able to find, disable traps, open locks<br/>\n<br/>\nWill go with Listen, drop Spot.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce Animal Empathy is 3 ranks, that enough to use Ranger Animal Empathy Skill. So 3 ranks in Animal Empathy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf thats still not good enough, then will have to shave a little tiny bit of points from each of the other skills, like going with 40 Ranks, instead of 43 Ranks, as example.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Level Splits.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was planing on 8 Ranger, 4 Cleric, 8 Assassin, Pre Epic to Max AB.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think your Split of Ranger 10, Cleric 12, Assassin 18 is extremely good.<br/>\n<br/>\nGives better BAB, AB. Yes the buffs are easiier to dispell, and buffs not maxed close to, at 14,15th lev Cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut just barely disagree slightly about what you said about offensive spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf take War, Magic as Domains, you have Melfs Acid Arrow, Ice Storm, Harm, as damage spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure thats not maximized, but still pretty good damage output for if, when death attack, fighting fails.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts not good, great, bot not bad either<br/>\n<br/>\nThink Ranger 10/Cleric 12/Assassin 18 is a very good split.<br/>\n<br/>\nI knew I was close, but just needed some help thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your help, comments.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts been truly helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I am going to use, make, take most to almost all of your changes, suggestions.</div>"

The flip side to the feat is that it's also a good defensive one - if you're in darkness or blinded and you don't have it then you're flat-footed all the time, which is not what you want. I'm often more keen to take it before Knockdown than not, as KD attempts drop your AB by 4, so you really need an AB of at least 5 before it's remotely useful. While the same is true of Expertise, at least that gives you the AC bump, so again I'd take that before KD. Oh, and IKD requires an intelligence of 13, so its more a \"clever\" feat than either a strength or dexterous one (just an observation).<br/>\n<br/>\nI do prefer your Reset already, and now I'm going to be a contrary bastard. If you've knocked Discipline on the head then you can drop Ranger down to 9 levels again - and you could take the final level pre-epic as well, to give you earlier access to Imp 2-Weapon Fighting. There's no cost or gain to AB, it just lets you be better at dual-wielding earlier. Speaking personally, I'd take that spare level as Assassin for an extra d6 to Death Attack while keeping the same number of skill points. So we'd end up back at Ranger 9/ Cleric 12/ Assassin 19. This is exactly the sort of stuff I try to work out on paper before boldly setting forth!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

Empower or Extend?<br/>\n<br/>\nEmpower will make Buffs harder to Dispel, and Extend will make Buffs last longer, but easier to dispel.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do you think Stag?</div>"

      "content": "<div>As I said before, I'm no expert on Clerics, and wouldn't want to offer dodgy advice - maybe someone else would be better placed to answer the Extend/Empower question?<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding Improved Expertise, let's have a look at where you'll be at level 40, without buffs or gear. If you decide to go with Ranger 9/ Cleric 12/ Assassin 19, with a final Dex of 30 and with Finesse, WF, EWF and Epic Prowess, your AB will be 27 (BAB) +10 (Dex) +3 (WF/EWF) +1 (EP) = 41/ 36/ 31/ 26. But that's single-handed: dual-wielding makes that 39/ 34/ 29/ 24 and 39/ 34, which is not too bad for a combat cleric. But losing 10 AB makes it 29/ etc, which is pretty rubbish, and after all, you can't hurt what you can't hit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there's the AC side of the equation. Again with the same split and again naked, your AC will be 10 (base) +10 (Dex) +8 (Tumble) +2 (Armor Skin) = 30. Expertise makes that 35. I don't know your PW or its levels of enhancements available from gear (+5, +10, more, less?), but that's pretty respectable without any buffs - and bear in mind you'll have Ghostly Visage, Imp Invisibility and stealth skills maxed, as well as what UMD can bring to the party.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I'd lose Imp Expertise for one of the spell feats. I wouldn't take it in epic levels either - you need all the feats you've got: 3 for EWF/ AS/ EP, 4 for stat increases and the 2 Assassin bonus feats for 2 more Great Dexs.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps, and someone else can advise on the Empower/Extend question.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

Higher level spell slotted spells either are, should be harder to dispel then lower level spells(At Least thats the way I remember it working in PNP. But I'll take your word for it that I am wrong here.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot that tbere is a big difference, between 10th level and 12th level, but its not 10th level cleric(I know the title and 1st post say differently), its 12th level cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd like more cleric levels, but MUST have at least 18 levels of Assassin, and 9 levels of Ranger, so absolute Max Cleric Levels would be 13.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think, want to do a 8 Ranger/4 Cleric/8 Assassin, Pre Epic Split.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I could maybe do a 6 Ranger/6 Cleric/8 Assassin, Pre Epic Split, and take the 1st 3 epic levels as Ranger levels to get to 9 lev Ranger on, at 23rd level.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut 6 cleric levels Pre Epic is MAX.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeed 6 levels of Ranger Pre Epic for animal companion and BAB, AB. Want either 14,15 BAB or I want to Max BAB.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeed 8 levs of Assassin Pre Epic, because Assassin gets HIPS, Hide In Plain Sight at 8th Lev Assassin, and like cleric level want them earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that why Max Cleric Levels is 4 or 6 cleric levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nDivine Favor is awesome, but there is Also:<br/>\n<br/>\nMagic Weapon, Bless, Mage Armor(Almost useless later on)(Magic Domain), Divine Favor, Shield of Faith(Useless, except at beginning level, levels), Aid, Cats Grace, Barkskin, Bull's Strength(damage output, not to hit), greater magic weapon, darkfire, Stoneskin(Magic Domain), Divine Oower<br/>\n<br/>\nDivine Power is awesome. If I remember right, get it at either 4,5,6 spell levels. I dont think it is a 7,8,9th level spell. So should be able to cast it with 12,13 levels of Cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for scrolls, I plan on stocking 5 to 8 scrolls of the more powerful, useful, popular buffs,spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd hopefully get some gear thay cast those spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for getting Cleric Levels Early:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first 12 Levels:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.

Ranger<br/>\n<br/>\n10. Ranger, animal companion, Ranger levels could either be done here at level 6 Ranger at 10th Level, Pre Epic, or could take 3 more Ranger Levels Pre Epic to get zimproved 2 weapon fighting Pre Epic<br/>\n<br/>\n11. Cleric<br/>\n<br/>\n12. Assassin<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom there:<br/>\n<br/>\n13. Cleric<br/>\n<br/>\n14. Assassin<br/>\n<br/>\n15. Cleric<br/>\n<br/>\n16. Assassin<br/>\n<br/>\n17. Cleric<br/>\n<br/>\n18.

Its kind of like rule of 4 thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut its a rule of 2, a rule of even over odd. Any even, every 2 levels for the Assassin Class, you get +1 BAB. So if Assassin 18, you get +1 BAB. But if Assassin 17. then lose 1 BAB.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext its the Death Attack DC.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe possible Splits are:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. 9 Ranger/12 Cleric/19 Assassin<br/>\n<br/>\n2. 9 Ranger/14 Cleric/17 Assassin<br/>\n<br/>\n3. 10 Ranger/12 Cleric/18 Assasin<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich one is the lesser of the 3?<br/>\n<br/>\nOption 2.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy?<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause 17 levels of Assassin doesnt give as strong Assassin DC AND<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause lose 1 BAB with 17 levels of Assassin instead of 18 levels of Assassin AND<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause it seems like from what Stag was saying that 17 Assassin Levels would not be able to get a Assassin Bonus Feat, like could with 18th Level Assassin taken at right epic feat level.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo best split is either 9 R/12 C /19 A or 10 R/12 C /18 A<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of those Reasons 18 or 19 levels of Assassin in this particular build, splits, etc, is almost a MUST have, and a almost SHOULD have over, vs 17 levels of Assassin.</div>"

Death Attack Assassin as 18,19 Assassin.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Buffing, darkness for Assassin, back up spells like Ice Storm, Harm, etc, for when Death attack not work <br/>\n<br/>\n3. Back up combat cleric fighter, when Death Attack not work.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Two Weapon fighting path, related to point 3 above.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Animal companion, combined with cleric summons as back up for when Death Attack not work.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis build is not OPT earlier. It is a deferred power build, that is more semi powerful later.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf do what you say. Yes can either take 7 levels of cleric early on, become a POWERFUL COMBAT CLERIC early on.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if do that, the build, purpose of the build named above, would be NERFED.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I do what you say, I might as well just drop, not make a Ranger/Cleric/Assassin.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Soonest I can take 7 Levels of Cleric<br/>\n<br/>\nIs to go with a 6 R/6 C/8 A build Pre Epic, then take 7th Lev Cleric at 21st Level then 3 straight Ranger Levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I take 7 levels of Cleric within the 1st 10 to 13 levels, it screws with Ranger Animal Companion.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I dont take Animal companion by Levels 12 to 16 and don't take animal companion until levels 17 to 20+, then might as well not take animal companion, and if not take that the only reason for Ranger levels is BAB, Two Weapon Path, Ranger Skills, and might as well not take Ranger Levels, and if no ranger levels, scrap build.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I dont take 8 levels of Assassin by, before, on 20th level, then weaker Death Attack DC, no HIPS, until TOO LATER, and again, might as well scrap build.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis build Needs a combination of:<br/>\n<br/>\n6 Levels Ranger Pre Epic, which should be completed no later then 10th,11th,12,13th level<br/>\n<br/>\n8 levels of Assassin for Death Attack, Death Attack DC, HIPS at 8th Assassin Level<br/>\n<br/>\n6 Levels of Cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it was possible to do all the above and 7 levels of Cleric I would.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand why you want 7 levels of cleric early, earlier on. But that isnt viable in this build.<br/>\n<br/>\nWish the math did work out to be 6 +7 +8 = 20 Pre Epic Levels, but the math doesnt work out that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only way I could see 7 Levels of cleric Pre Epic is to take 7th Cleric Lev at 20th Lev or between 16th to 20th Level, and then take 8th Assassin Level at 21st Level, then 3 straight Ranger Level.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that is probably still not early enough for you in taking 7 cleric levels early, earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if thats the case, if do that, I destroy the build, and might as well scrap the build.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich I'm not going to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo will tale 7th level on, by, at 20th lev, 21st Level.<br/>\n<br/>\nThats the Earliest I am willing to take, get to 7th Lev Cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I think the others would agree with that or something somewhat similar whether 12,13,14 Cleric Levels in Split, build.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Ok in above Comment I said I was going to use 1 of Gkorjax's suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter thinking about his suggestion of taking 7 levels of cleric thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have come up with the following:<br/>\n<br/>\nLev 1: Ranger<br/>\n<br/>\nLev 2: Cleric<br/>\n<br/>\nLev 3: Ranger<br/>\n<br/>\nLev 4 Cleric<br/>\n<br/>\nLev 5: Ranger<br/>\n<br/>\nLev 6 Assassin<br/>\n<br/>\nLev 7: Assassin<br/>\n<br/>\nLev 8: Cleric<br/>\n<br/>\nLev 9: Cleric<br/>\n<br/>\nLev 10: Cleric<br/>\n<br/>\nLev 11: Cleric<br/>\n<br/>\nLev 12: Cleric(7 Cleric Levels, 4th lev Spells, Divine Power)<br/>\n<br/>\nLev 13: Ranger<br/>\n<br/>\nLev 14: Ranger<br/>\n<br/>\nLev 15: Ranger(6th Level Ranger, Animal Companion)<br/>\n<br/>\nPause<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that's just barely ok, borderline for taking Animal Companion as 14th, 15th, 16, Level is the beginning, start of Animal Companion being somewhat lesser, less effective, not as effective.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo just barely ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso 12th level is the Earliest that can do 7 levels of Cleric, without messing up build.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext going to take 6 straight levels of Assassin to get to 8th Level Assassin for HIPS as fast as possible, because of the taking 7 levels of cleric by lev 12.<br/>\n<br/>\n16th Lev: Assassin<br/>\n<br/>\n17th Lev: Assassin<br/>\n<br/>\n18th Lev: Assassin<br/>\n<br/>\n19th Lev: Assassin<br/>\n<br/>\n20th Lev: Assassin<br/>\n<br/>\n21 lev: Assassin.<br/>\n<br/>\n22: Ranger<br/>\n<br/>\n23 Ranger<br/>\n<br/>\n24 Ranger<br/>\n<br/>\n25: Assassin<br/>\n<br/>\n26. Cleric<br/>\n<br/>\n27. Assassin<br/>\n<br/>\n28. Cleric<br/>\n<br/>\n29. Cleric<br/>\n<br/>\n30. Cleric<br/>\n<br/>\n31. Cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\n32. Assassin<br/>\n<br/>\n33. Assassin<br/>\n<br/>\n34.

Assassin<br/>\n<br/>\nSo thats the earliest can take 7 levels of cleric, by, at 12th level.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in order to do that, I have to Reset, because Gkorjax's suggestion came after I had taken 9 levels(5 Ranger, 2 Cleric, 2 Assassin)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo not possible to do Gkorjax's suggestion unless I either reset, or go with a even slightly less optimized, slightly messed up build.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think its better to Reset.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I am Resetting<br/>\n<br/>\nGood thing fast leveling PW.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut please if going to make suggestions, please lets try to get them in before I would have to reset, so that I dont have to Reset.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am only Reseting maybe 1, or maybe 2, or maybe 3 times more at the most, if its necessary, and then if still need to reset then again, I am just going to go what with got, and not Reset again, because only so many times that will reset, before my patience wears out.</div>"

Thats why I am Resetting.<br/>\n<br/>\n12th Level for 7th level Cleric, 4th lev spells, divine power, may be too late for Gkorjax's liking, and he probably wants 1st 7 levels as Cleric, etc, but any sooner then 12th lev for 7th lev Cleric, 4th lev Spells, Divine Power, and that would probably mess up the build, concept, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways since this is last New Reset, I hope you guys make suggestions, before its to late to use your suggestions.</div>"

It made me realize that after Ranger 3, Cleric 2, Assassin 2, I am going about this in the wrong way.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. BAB is meaningless because of Divine Power.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Because of Cleric Summon Spells, which didnt think Cleric had a lot of, does have a lot of, Ranger Animal Companion Redundant, not needed<br/>\n<br/>\n3. That because Improved 2 Weap Fighting is only helps eliminate a minor to hit penalty for dual wielding, and because of Divine Power giving, replacing with +20 Fighter BAB, that a minor to hit penalty for dual wielding can easily be overcome with Divine Power, Cats Grace, all the cleric cheese, GEAR, that raises Dex, BAB, AB, so high, that Ranger 9th Lev Improved 2 Weap fighting feat is ALMOST meaningless IN THIS BUILD.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Because of above only 3 levels of Ranger is needed. Your basically only taking the 3 levels of Ranger for:<br/>\n<br/>\nA. Being able to get to Ranger 3, Cleric 2, Assassin 2, qualifying for Assassin.<br/>\n<br/>\nB. Ambidexterity, Two Weapon feat<br/>\n<br/>\nC. Early BAB, before Divine Power kicks in.<br/>\n<br/>\nD. Skills points.<br/>\n<br/>\nE. Altho 4th lev Ranger gives 1st lev druid spell(s), its rendundant because of Cleric Spellcasting<br/>\n<br/>\nSo because of that I have to revise my level splits, after Ranger 3, Cleric 2, Assassin 2, and what, which classes taking at each level up after that, and the Pre Epic Split, and Post Epic Split.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo new splits:<br/>\n<br/>\nPre Epic:<br/>\n<br/>\nRanger 3/Cleric 9(Divine Power, 5th lev Spells)/Assassin 8<br/>\n<br/>\nPost Epic 40 levels<br/>\n<br/>\nRanger 3/Cleric 13(7th lev Spells), Assassin 24<br/>\n<br/>\nLevels:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.

Assassin(Knockdown)<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Assassin<br/>\n<br/>\n8. Cleric(Increased Dex from 18 to 19<br/>\n<br/>\n9. Cleric(improved Knockdown)<br/>\n<br/>\n10. Cleric<br/>\n<br/>\n11. Cleric<br/>\n<br/>\n12. Cleric(Cleric 7, 4th lev spells, Divine Power(Wis 13 increased to Wis 14 in order to cast 4th level spells divine power), (Improved Critical Rapier)<br/>\n<br/>\nThats where I am now<br/>\n<br/>\nThen:<br/>\n<br/>\n13. Ranger<br/>\n<br/>\n14. Ranger<br/>\n<br/>\n15. Ranger(Animal Companion(Blind Fight)<br/>\n<br/>\n16. Assassin(Increase dex from 19 to 20<br/>\n<br/>\n17. Assassin<br/>\n<br/>\n18. Assassin(Edit(Forgot to put in(Extend Spell Metamagic(for extending Divine power cheesyness)<br/>\n<br/>\n19. Assassin<br/>\n<br/>\n20. Assassin(Increase Dex from 20 to 21)<br/>\n<br/>\n21. Assassin(Amor Skin or Epic Weapon Focus(8th Level Assassin(HIPS)<br/>\n<br/>\n22. Ranger<br/>\n<br/>\n23. Ranger<br/>\n<br/>\n24. Ranger(Last Ranger Level, Improved 2 weapon fighting)(Great Dex increase dex from 21 to 22)(increase wis from 14 to 15, so as to be able to cast 5th level cleric spells by lev 27, Cleric Lev 9)<br/>\n<br/>\n25. Cleric<br/>\n<br/>\n26. Assassin<br/>\n<br/>\n27. Cleric(Level 9 Cleric(5th level spells)(Epic Weap Foc or Armor Skin<br/>\n<br/>\n28. Cleric(Increase Wisdom from 15 to 16 to be able to cast 6th level spells at lev 29, 11th level cleric, 6th lev spells, Harm, Bladebarrier, Heal)<br/>\n<br/>\n29. Cleric(Last Cleric level at Cleric Level 11, 6th level cleric spells, Harm, Heal, Bladebarrier)<br/>\n<br/>\n30. Assassin(Great Dex increase Dec 22 to Dex 23)<br/>\n<br/>\n31.

Assassin(Last Character level, Last Assassin Level at Assassin 20)(increase Dex from Dex 29 to Dex 30)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this is the build plan that going to follow to get to Ranger 9/Cleric 11/Assassin 20<br/>\n<br/>\nThink this will work ok, just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut where I need the help is after levels 24,25, with placement of Cleric, Assassin Levels after 25, and when, which, where to take epic feats at, in the epic levels, and when to take the great Dex's versus over epic feats, and when to take epic feats over Great Dex's, and which Epic Feats to Take over other epic feats and when.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I have done a ok job at that, but I think I could do better, optimize if had, have help with that.</div>"

Is the same way you seem to have seen Mick's Dark Moon's Agent, Monk 2/Cleric 8/Assassin 30 build.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou, or Max suggested that Mick go with Monk 2-6/Cleric 12/Assassin 22, and said that would be ok because if 22 levels of Assassin, wasnt able to death attack, then character would find another way.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see my build is kind of like your build suggestion of Monk 2-6/Cleric 12/Assassin 22 to Mick.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly difference is 3 to 9 levels of ranger, instead of Monk, and a couple of cleric levels difference, and a couple of Assassin Levels difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way I see your suggestion to Mick, and my build here is that there is like a kind of versatile but not too watered down VOLTRONIC effect, synergy <br/>\n<br/>\nIf Assassin Death Attack doesnt work, then still lots of sneak attack damage, and if thst doesnt work. .<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there is dex melee high AB, High AC, unless dispelled fighting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if that is dispelled(And Not all Epic level monsters, effects, etc, dispell.Some do, some dont) Then. .<br/>\n<br/>\nThen try Harm, Blade Barrier<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if that dont work, then UMD use a item, or scroll spell, that will work.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd failing that, have sanctuary, and can always be a part of adventuring party and use sanctuary, hide, while helping your friends with spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd sometimes on extremely rare occassions, there will be a enemy that cant beat that kills you because of a weakeness.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way I see it, if I have 9 Levels of Ranger in build for improved 2 weapon feat path, then the only way to do that is split I have.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnything less then Cleric 11, and wontvget the needed at least 6th level spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Anything more then Cleric 11 and I either wouldnt be able to have 9 ranger leveks and at least 20, half of leveks be Assassin Level.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if Assassin Levels less then 20, then that wouldnt work as good.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the trade off is 1 less +1/+1, at, and +3/+3, instead of +4/+4, for getting Ranger 9, Animal Companion, improved 2 weapon fighting, and getting at least 6th level cleric spells, and at least 20 levels of Assassin, then I am ok with that, and is small price pay<br/>\n<br/>\nOtherwise would, could scrap Ranger 9/Cleric 11, Assassin 20, to go with Ranger 2,3/Cleric 11-15/ Assassin 22 to 24 to 27<br/>\n<br/>\nOr scrap this multiclassed Ranger/Cleric/Assassin build.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think my Ranger 9/Cleric 11/Assassin 20, will be ok <br/>\n<br/>\nAlready has AC to about 35/40/43<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd AB is about 32/27.</div>"
