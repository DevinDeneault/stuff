      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hi All,<br/>\n<br/>\n Unlike most, if not all, threads in this section, I'm not here to recommend the campaign - yet, anyway. I have but recently downloaded these modules, and have some questions. Hopefully, others in the Guild will be able to help furnish answers. That way, if the campaign's any good, those of us uninitiated in SDD (acceptable shorthand?) will be able to travel together through it with a mentor or two in tow - not in a walkthrough kind of way, but more one of issues, cries for help, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n Discussions around the campaign started <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/reply/20853149/Intelligent-HalfOrc-Possibilities#reply-20853149\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>here.</strong></span></a><br/>\n<br/>\n Do please ignore the first blatherings thereon, they have naught to do with this. I start annoying people with questions about this campaign at about contribution #10. My current outstanding question (not a quality judgement) being whether SDD is Dev Crit enabled or not? I'll be assuming normal (OC) NwN1 rules, classes, etc apply in un-nerfed fashion unless told otherwise. I just don't really want to spend time building something that I'll have to change once I've hit epic levels and realise some of the feats I've chosen are redundant (yes, Great Cleave, I'm looking at you).<br/>\n<br/>\n In any event, I hope the Empyres, Valerfors and such luminaries (I discounted Hip, as a mostly PW or PnP player, though any input from him would, of course, be welcome) will occasionally cast their eyes this way. Or, it could all go to the Abyss... <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"color:#0000FF\">edit</span></strong>: per Hip, furnished jump-over link to Neverwinter Vault project and onwards; 20160724<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks Empyre - that's both helpful and annoying. Helpful because it fully answers my question. Annoying because for some reason I'd got it in my head that the full campaign took you into the 30s. That said, presumably on completion one's build can then be carried across elsewhere. But if that doesn't float your boat, one need only design a character to max-out between levels 16 and 18, which actually might be very useful for fledgling builders - particularly given the campaign's reputed low-med magic environment, so it ain't all about the gear.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also thanks to Hip for tidying up my first post - much purtier, and appreciated!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I reckon my building skills still need some work, so I'll go with something tried and tested first, just to get a feel for the place. And lo, there was Mick Dagger's Brawler Champion snoozing in the Level 20 section of the Guild! As one given more to the un-arcane arts, a Fighter 8/Monk 2/CoT 10 build looks ideal: good saves, decent AC and AB, lovely. Thanks Mick! Just going to fire it up now. This does mean I'll be playing two different Aielund campaigns and this one simultaneously, but variety's the spice of life, right? <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\n I should have got the hang of making my links succinct and elegant by now, but I haven't, so this is it: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2350552/Brawler-champion-Fighter-8-Monk-2-CoT10#.V5YUixJnEqg\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/23 ... 5YUixJnEqg</a><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Henchmen/companions: worthwhile? And if so, how many can/should you take, and what's the AI like? I'm not asking <em>who</em> to take with me, 'cause I guess that's a judgement call, depending on one's own build, play-style and alignment. I've already got Nooble, but may have to drop him - he too is a meleer, and has a ridiculous name to boot - depending on any answers to the questions above, because I've just met a Rogue (albeit a crap one - she got caught and wants me to pay her fine) and they're always handy to have around. As a predominantly melee player, I'm always on the lookout for someone who can either stop me from exploding or kiss it better when I do!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I do remember that Demon assumes that the PC and the hench of the opposite sex have become a couple, but I seem to recall a female Cleric, not a Rogue. Maybe you meet her in a later chapter? I think you are allowed only one hench. I'm sorry that my memory of this is so hazy.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Sorry for being late to the party...<br/>\n<br/>\n a) There are both there, both are female, one is a rogue the other is a \"celestial being\" but a cleric non-the-less. Both are romantic options for a player character. Both will bestow some small \"gifts\" to your character and they also have some small power-ups intertwined to the story for them. And if you dont have Tony's AI both of them are going to suck big time but at least if i remember correctly default Linu's is better than default Tommu's but whatever, It is ultimately an RP choice. And there is always Noober ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n b) There are only two campaigns that will take you to the high thirtie's lvl. Sands of Fate and Aielund. Unless you want to enter a random dungeon generator module (i don't remember the name but Mick was used to play one if i recall correctly). And there was an arena-type module (very old) that pitted the HoF builds Vs your PC. All the other choices will bring you up to high twentie's - thirty lvl maximum. That is why in old times there was a thread that specified a path that your hero could take with the same character and take them to high lvls, but still not forty. It was named \"The Heroe's Path\" you can google it and find out more about it. It basically linked similar modules for your character to take that made sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n c) These small campaigns that finish before twenty lvl or slightly above it, and are of low to medium magic, are perfect opportunities for you to play somethiing that isn't a straight melee build. Try playing a wizard or bard in those module paths is also a very good choice because the power\u00a0 lvl of your magic will be stronger, far stronger than the items sold in there. Most people who played Saleron's Gambit for example said (comments from the old nwnVault) that playing a wizard/ bard there, was a superb experience compared to a fighter. I guess Adam Miller's campaign will be similar in that regard.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Brilliant. Secondly, given the likelihood of only one companion, it'll either be the rogue or the healer, given my proclivities. And yes, I know I really should practice taking some arcane classes, but not on my first run-through, eh? Sometimes I think you're just trying to improve me, and that would never do\u00a0<img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" />. I haven't met the \"celestial being\" yet (Valerfor, are you sure you're not thinking of Nellise in Aielund?), I've only just appeared on the streets of Scornubel.

My point was about enjoying the play, and I don't see why the Abbot wouldn't be fun, plus, I like the idea of an empowered owl. Sorry, you were being an earnest soul, and facetious is my forte.<br/>\n<br/>\n I do get the no/limited gloves issue (though I <em>really</em> don't like \"fister\" as a monicker). I suppose I was looking for a STR-based Monk/Cleric because, as you know, I lurve Monks and tend towards STR builds (so, yes, by and large kamas can blow it out my hairy white...).<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, I do seem to have problems with Max's builds, generally. Don't get me wrong, it's <em>my</em> issue, the builds themselves are stupendous, and I can see that and have a deep respect for them, but, oh, I really do have to work at playing them. I guess that everyone achieves some sort of synergy with varying builds and playing styles, and Max's just don't seem to gel with mine, where a lot of Empyre's and Valerfor's do (notwithstanding that, if I'm going for a DEXer, or want to try an Evil build, my first thought would be \"find Mick\"). Thus, in an alien environment, with an alien character, I didn't know where to look, so thought...Hip! And he brought a nice back-story to dinner with him, which was considerate.<br/>\n<br/>\n Regardless, Blood and Faith seems to have everything I could want in/from a Cleric build (Cleric 26/ Bard 4/ RDD 10). I know you're all aware of it, and it has it's place in the pantheon guaranteed, but I'm looking forward to playing it. I hope I don't let it down.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The tougher it is, the faster you'll learn. All the OC does is show a new player how to use the game interface. Combat situations are pitifully pedestrian and actually encourage bad habits.\u00a0 Stick with it. Be resourceful.<br/>\n<br/>\n First off, what toon level?\u00a0 I'm assuming a cleric 1 with at least 16 WIS.\u00a0 You should be slotting Magic Weapon, Shield of Faith and either Bless or Div Favor.\u00a0 If they have them and can afford them, use Bless/Aid pots and slot DF instead of Bless.\u00a0 By cleric 2, Bless duration will be double Div Favor but you'll have the extra slot.\u00a0 If you are really struggling, slot a summon.\u00a0 If there are skels/zombies, try turning them before moving into melee.\u00a0 Worse case scenario, slot all 3 summons to tank, pick up an xbow and snipe until your cleric gains some more prowess and HP. So what build did you finally settle on so we can follow in our playbooks?<br/>\n<br/>\n A key module question:\u00a0 What are the rest restrictions, if any?<br/>\n<br/>\n 2nd question: What domains did you select?\n<blockquote><div>And second: is it right that I'm getting no xp from killing things?

I'm going to do some minor cheating by trying to get it right in the OC first (I guess I've started treating that as my training programme).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n 1. Nah. The tougher it is, the faster you'll learn. All the OC does is show a new player how to use the game interface. Combat situations are pitifully pedestrian and actually encourage bad habits.\u00a0 Stick with it. Be resourceful.<br/>\n<br/>\n 2. First off, what toon level?\u00a0 I'm assuming a cleric 1 with at least 16 WIS.\u00a0 You should be slotting Magic Weapon, Shield of Faith and either Bless or Div Favor.\u00a0 If they have them and can afford them, use Bless/Aid pots and slot DF instead of Bless.\u00a0 By cleric 2, Bless duration will be double Div Favor but you'll have the extra slot.\u00a0 If you are really struggling, slot a summon.\u00a0 If there are skels/zombies, try turning them before moving into melee.\u00a0 Worse case scenario, slot all 3 summons to tank, pick up an xbow and snipe until your cleric gains some more prowess and HP. So what build did you finally settle on so we can follow in our playbooks?<br/>\n<br/>\n 3. A key module question:\u00a0 What are the rest restrictions, if any?<br/>\n<br/>\n 4. 2nd question: What domains did you select?\n<blockquote><div>And second: is it right that I'm getting no xp from killing things? Quests and so on, fine, but nowt at all?<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">5. Didn't know if this series used that system, too.\u00a0 Almraiven is pretty much played this way, with most all XP coming from quest's completion (and there are piles of those) with the combat relegated to just an obstacle to survive.\u00a0 If the module has respawning encounters, it prevents players from farming cheap XP and leveling with little effort.\u00a0 Not sure if that's the case here, but it is a quite common way to control challenge.</div>\n</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">Many thanks for this, Hip. I've numbered your paras for ease of reference.<br/>\n<br/>\n 1. Fair enough. In for a penny, in for a pounding! I'm not sure \"the tougher it is, the faster you'll learn\" is always true, though: \"Great, you can count to 10, now here's the Principia Mathematica.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n 2. Aye, Cleric 1, with 16 WIS. I'm using Empyre's build as cited above - Level 20 Melee Cleric (C17/ F3) - it's post #17 on p2 of this thread. As for the slots (and it took me an embarrassingly long time to find where they were, that's my level of unfamiliarity with casters!), I'd looked at Max's guide and slotted 2xDiv Favours and 1xShield of Faith. Max agrees that Bless is a non-vital, along with Prot from Alignment, Mage Armour and Endure Elephants (<img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" />), but doesn't mention Magic Weapon at all, so I didn't think of it.\u00a0 I'm loath to use summons if I can avoid it. I always have been, in Baldur's and Icewind as well (my only other two RPGs), and normally tell any caster companion not to cast them. Don't know why, guess it's just me. I decided to leave Blood and Faith for either SoU/HotU/Sands of Fate or, more likely, Aielund, where it can stretch its legs properly.<br/>\n<br/>\n 3. Er, don't know. Will find out.<br/>\n<br/>\n 4. Magic and Trickery, as per Empyre's build (was tempted by War, but didn't want to bugger around with a build on my first go!).<br/>\n<br/>\n 5. Alright then. I'm sure I'll get used to it, and Shadowlords is not billed as being combat-heavy in any case, so whatevs.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers - or (to nick Kail's line, via Tennyson) To seek, and not to yield<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Sorry, just read your reply to Empyre's build, Hip (post #19), and with his permission, I'll amend accordingly (assuming I understand it properly, of course!)</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

This topic has been dormant forever, but I'd like to comment on a few things, seeing as my name was mentioned a couple of times.<br/>\n<br/>\n 1- Stag, I build for level 40 power. That's my style, and I rely on my experience as a NWN player to overcome the challenge. You may need to learn a few of my \"signature moves\" to level my builds less painstaikingly, such as the Taunt / Expertise combo, which AFAIK I'm the only player who knows how to utilize properly (and automatically). As for my Cleric builds, I would recommend that you stick to the leveling strategy portrayed in the guide if you wish to level them up. Clerics are NOT self-buffers until level 7, maybe even level 9, and they NEED you to adopt a different playstyle to succeed. You basically need more long-duration strategies to gain more levels. The Animate Dead / Inflict Wounds strategy (to heal your undead summons) or even Healing Kits (which somehow heal skeletons LOL) are my preferred weapons. If you are playing Cleric as a self-buffer from level 1, you're doing it wrong! Do you think I'd be able to survive with my 8-STR Cleric / Monks if I went toe to toe with the enemy early on? Remember the guide: Embrio Stage is the hardest phase for a Cleric. Don't overestimate your power in the first levels. You're a weakling and should intelligently recognize that and act accordingly :D.<br/>\n<br/>\n 2- Hip, I'm NOT wrong. Bless is absolutely a non-vital buff. You, like Stag above, are playing your Cleric as a level 1 self-buffer, when you could be summoning instead. There's no reason to suffer unnecessarily trying to melee with a level 1-6 Cleric (whose buffs are all at +1 or +2 tops and have insignificant durations) when you can have much stronger beasts doing your bidding for you. After level 7, you'll have A COUPLE of instances of \"god mode\" per rest with DP / DF, or maybe even just 1, but a Skeleton Warrior buffed with Bull's Strength and Darkfire will still do most of the killing for you. In fact, you can even tank for it with Expertise and lower enemy AC with Taunt while it clears the screen of monsters, Alternatively, you can do the same with a henchman instead of the skelly. The most powerful buffs in the Cleric arsenal are the low-duration ones, and those will only become significant after level\u00a09 (which is also when you get Extended Divine Power). However, you're most likely going to be summoning all the way to level 12 if you play correctly, since you won't be having enough instances of each spell to last you through the day. Of course, if you're playing with no rest restrictions, and you can rest after each encounter, then you might play it that way after level 9. I have tried to play Clerics as self-buffers from the getgo in the past, and that experience has taught me that it's much harder than just summoning and watching things die, especially since you get Animate Dead as a level 3 spell.<br/>\n<br/>\n 3- Low magic settings are where Clerics should shine, however, if this module only goes up to level 11, you won't even get to the best part of playing them which is about level 15 and over. So, if that's the case, then perhaps this module is better played with another type of toon.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I've been kicking myself for a long time about why I struggled with some of your (admittedly excellent) builds, when I, too, am an up-front and personal type of player by inclination. It's that you build for the destination, while I love the journey. I'm sure a lot of that is down to the fact that you've been playing since god was little (and are thus more capable than I in overcoming obstacles that seem insurmountable), while I'm only just potty-trained, and that I've never actually reached level 40 as yet - level 37 on Aielund is the closest I've been.<br/>\n<br/>\n Still, I'm better than I was, and am learning constantly, and with different types of build and style.

Clerics are NOT self-buffers until level 7, maybe even level 9, and they NEED you to adopt a different playstyle to succeed. You basically need more long-duration strategies to gain more levels. The Animate Dead / Inflict Wounds strategy (to heal your undead summons) or even Healing Kits (which somehow heal skeletons LOL) are my preferred weapons. If you are playing Cleric as a self-buffer from level 1, you're doing it wrong! Do you think I'd be able to survive with my 8-STR Cleric / Monks if I went toe to toe with the enemy early on? Remember the guide: Embrio Stage is the hardest phase for a Cleric. Don't overestimate your power in the first levels. You're a weakling and should intelligently recognize that and act accordingly :D.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers!<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">Ah - that's where we divide in our styles! I've been kicking myself for a long time about why I struggled with some of your (admittedly excellent) builds, when I, too, am an up-front and personal type of player by inclination. It's that you build for the destination, while I love the journey. I'm sure a lot of that is down to the fact that you've been playing since god was little (and are thus more capable than I in overcoming obstacles that seem insurmountable), while I'm only just potty-trained, and that I've never actually reached level 40 as yet - level 37 on Aielund is the closest I've been.<br/>\n<br/>\n Still, I'm better than I was, and am learning constantly, and with different types of build and style. Discussions such as this help hugely.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers</div>\n</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">Potty Trained LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\n Stag, don't sell yourself short, brother! You might be getting closer to teenage years now. There's still a long way to go, but the most important thing is that you're moving in the right direction. But let me elaborate on this a bit further, since you like the discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\n Suppose you encounter a hurdle, right? Well, there are\u00a0two basic\u00a0ways to overcome that hurdle. You can:<br/>\n - Change your build<br/>\n - Change your in-game approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, if your hurdle is to not be able to open a lock, you can add a few points in Open Lock or you can buy a scroll of Knock and use it. Both get the job done. I have found that trying to compensate the \"gimpedness\" of a build with intelligent in-game decision making will make you a better player overall. You'll learn new ways to use your toons and that will add to your \"repertoire\" of moves. Let me give you a practical example:<br/>\n<br/>\n I was playing Nathyrra on WoG a while back and the Drow were just such a big PITA that I was literally getting annihilated over and over again. Then I switched a couple of spells I had memorized (Invisibility for Darkness) and I began to dominate them like never before. My problem was that, as an Assassin, I would attack the first mage and then the priestesses or secondary mages would have time to cast Time Stop, buff up and kick my ass. But If I cast Darkness just before engaging, the secondary ones wouldn't see me inside the darkness and I'd kill the first Wizard, then stealth again and kill off the rest, going back into the AoE of Darkness every time I needed to re-stealth.<br/>\n<br/>\n I could, of course, have tried to solve that problem by changing her build. Specifically this one might've been hard to do, but maybe adding SD for HiPS or something similar so I would avoid Dispel.<br/>\n<br/>\n Same resoning goes to any other problems you can encounter with many different builds. Switching an item could make an unwinnable fight doable (like putting on a death-immunity belt against a necromancer). Most problems you struggle with in-game can be solved in-game. To me, after having played for so long, that's what keeps it challenging and fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n My strongest builds are tough to play nowadays, because with my improved playstyle, I just trample everything now.<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, I hope this info is useful to you. I was reading my Playing Better guide and remembering what it was like to play the game before knowing what I know now. Have you read it? Maybe in the first part when I describe my journey, you can see part of yours too.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers!<br/>\n \u00a0</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

As it is, I've just met Preth and the Red Guards and had to drop a couple of cases of loot near his camp (hopefully for later retrieval). I'm now searching for a suspect scout, but still at level 2. As far as I can tell, I cleared Eureka of all its nasties (although that ghostly voice in the brothel still hasn't gone away). Does that sound about right?

Am I just missing something obvious?\n</details>\n\nThanks in advance!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I seriously hope this isn't boffoed, because I don't have any old saves prior to hitting this level of the temple. Granted, I'm not <em>that </em>far into the story, but 'twould suck nonetheless to have to start over from scratch.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I'm running with Tiera as my companion. I'm playing a CN toon and didn't think it made much sense to be gallivanting around with a celestial. I'm intrigued to progress farther and learn about her future magical bonuses...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Turns out there's a whole other dungeon down there that I skipped because I'm used to the NWN convention of exit doors on the left and right leading to the same place. Well, turns out Mr. Miller broke from convention, and even though both doors lead down, they lead down to entirely different dungeon complexes. Well played, sir; well played indeed.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
