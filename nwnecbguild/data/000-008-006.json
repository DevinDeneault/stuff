\t<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Background, Analysis and Comments by Author</strong> <br/>\n<br/>\nEquipment<br/>\n2 Short Swords<br/>\nPadded Armor or robes <br/>\n<br/>\nOffensive Techniques<br/>\nThe Dark Stalker's offensive training has centered on stealth, hunting, and perfecting a lethal Death Attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nHunting: With training as a ranger, and maxed out Search, Spot, and Listen skills, the Dark Stalker is able to track down their prey with ease. The Dark Stalker is also skilled in setting traps for the quarry, a tactical element that can often play a key role in his assassination missions.<br/>\n<br/>\nStealth: The Dark Stalker has perfected his stealth skills through having maximum ranks in Hide and Move Silently, and taking the Stealthy, Epic Skill Focus (Hide), and Epic Skill Focus (Move Silently) feats. These base abilities can be further augmented through the spell-like abilities of Invisibility and Improved Invisibility. With this combination of skills, feats, and spell like abilities, the Dark Stalker is practically undetectable without magic.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Killing Blow: With extensive training in the arts of assassination and a keen intellect, the Dark Stalker is able to precisely target particular components of anatomy, such that any sneak attack will instantly paralyze their foe unless the target can make a Fortitude save of DC 36. Such paralyzation is a signed death warrant, with a Coup de Grace sure to follow. This fearsome technique has earned the Dark Stalker's sneak attacks the somewhat misleading moniker of Death Attack. The Death Attack only functions when the target is not aware of the Dark Stalker or distracted by combat, thus the Dark Stalker has honed his reactions to the point where he can act in an instant to seize the Initiative and set the course of the confrontation. To ensure that his attack will hit, the Dark Stalker has perfected his aim with the short sword by taking the Weapon Focus, Epic Weapon Focus, and Epic Prowess feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nDefensive Techniques<br/>\nOnce the Dark Stalker has killed his proscribed target, he often must make an escape under less than ideal circumstances, as his targets frequently have hordes of underlings that wish to make a name for themselves by avenging their fallen master.<br/>\n<br/>\nManeuverability: Through the Mobility feat and the Tumble skill, the Dark Stalker is able to effortlessly glide through any angry throng, safely protected from any Attacks of Opportunity their foes might attempt due to their movement. The graceful movements of the Dark Stalker make him much harder to strike in combat at the best of times, through the feats Dodge and Epic Dodge. The Dark Stalker has an uncanny ability to dodge out of the way of blows and attacks that they are not even consciously aware of, allowing them to retain their dexterity bonus at all times. Finally, they are able to easily dive out of the way of spells that allow Reflex saves, such as the iconic Fireball spell, thanks to their Improved Evasion ability.<br/>\n<br/>\nArcane Spell-Like Abilities: When confronted by an angry mob, the Dark Stalker reacts with calm aplomb. He can call upon various spell-like abilities to aid themselves and confound their enemies. Blinding Speed allows the Dark Stalker to move with, well, blinding speed, enhancing their movement rate and ability to dodge incoming blows, as well as providing an extra attack each round of combat. The Dark Stalker may call upon an arcane Darkness to descend upon the battle field, blinding his enemies while the Dark Stalker's dark vision allows them to function normally. Finally, when forced to engage in combat, the Dark Stalker can meld partially with shadows to allow blows to pass through them without making contact, through the abilities of Shadow Evade and Ghostly Visage.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscretion: Sometimes, when an assassination doesn't go precisely to plan, or the escape route is more troublesome than expected, hiding and running away might be the most sensible option. Disregard any notions of the Dark Stalker fleeing in a panic with his tail between his legs, not that they even have a tail, of course. The Dark Stalker possesses the supernatural ability to meld into any shadow, to disappear from view even when keenly observed, to Hide in Plain Sight. Thus, the Dark Stalker might engage in guerrilla tactics of attacking, withdrawing, and attacking again when unexpected. Or, the Dark Stalker might strike once to fell their target, then immediately withdraw back to the shadows, leaving the enemy camp in an uproar as they vainly hunt in a futile quest for revenge.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I have looked at this legacy build once more and there is more that can be improved than the flawed ISA feats.<br/>\nSo I revamped the build, trying to stay in line with the idea of a Ranger/Assassin/SD stalker with Epic dodge.<br/>\nI changed several things. On the surface the most striking change is that I take less SD levels, 10 instead of 13. I lose an epic feat that way, but the gain more than outweights that. I also take the first SD level ASAP. Another difference is that I only take intelligence 14. A strict skill prioritization makes that possible, and more Assassin levels actually give a better Death attack DC.<br/>\nI also drop the Epic skill focus feats. Stealth is good enough with full ranks and a high dexterity.<br/>\nAnd this dex based stalker doesn't need the initiative feats.<br/>\nWeapon finesse comes at lvl 1 where it belongs. I added Blind fight and the KD feats. If you don't like the saves, you can always take Luck of heroes, Iron will and Great fortitude instead.<br/>\nDexterity ends at 34 instead of 26. Hence the most striking difference is the +4 to both AB and AC.<br/>\nThat makes the AB (+42) compete with warrior builds.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Ranger(5), Assassin(25), Shadowdancer(10), \n\nDEX: 19 (34)\nWIS: 11\nCHA: 8\n\n02: Ranger(2)\n04: Ranger(4): DEX+1, (DEX=20)\n06: Assassin(1): Mobility\n08: Shadowdancer(1): DEX+1, {Hide in Plain Sight}, (DEX=21)\n10: Assassin(4)\n12: Assassin(6): DEX+1, Blind Fight, (DEX=22)\n14: Assassin(8)\n16: Shadowdancer(3): DEX+1, (DEX=23)\n18: Shadowdancer(5): Improved Knockdown, {Defensive Roll}\n20: Shadowdancer(7): DEX+1, {Slippery Mind}, (DEX=24)\n22: Assassin(10)\n24: Assassin(12): DEX+1, Epic Prowess, (DEX=25)\n26: Shadowdancer(9)\n28: Assassin(13): DEX+1, (DEX=26)\n30: Assassin(15): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=28)\n32: Assassin(17): INT+1, (INT=15)\n34: Assassin(19)\n36: Assassin(21): INT+1, Great Dexterity V, (DEX=31), (INT=16)\n38: Assassin(23)\n40: Assassin(25): DEX+1, (DEX=34)\nHitpoints: 280\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 18/15/34\nBAB: 26\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 30/33\nAlignment Changes: 0\nDisable Trap 1(4), Heal 12(12), Hide 43(55), Listen 43(45), Move Silently 43(55), Open Lock 3(15), Search 16(21), Set Trap 3(15), Spot 43(45), Tumble 40(52), UMD 36(35)\n\n02: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Save(7), \n04: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Save(13), \n06: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(3), Spot(1), Tumble(9), UMD(6), \n08: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(3), Spot(1), Save(2), \n10: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(2), Spot(1), Save(1), \n12: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(5), Save(2), \n14: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(3), Spot(1), \n16: Hide(1), Listen(5), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), \n18: Hide(1), Listen(5), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), \n20: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Save(5), \n22: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(5), Save(1), \n24: Hide(1), Listen(2), Move Silently(1), Spot(2), \n26: Hide(1), Listen(3), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Save(2), \n28: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), UMD(5), \n30: Hide(1), Listen(2), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), UMD(1), \n32: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(5), \n34: Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), UMD(2), \n36: Heal(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Save(2), \n38: Heal(3), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), \n40: Heal(3), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), \n</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I think this is a valiant upgrade of the original build. My only issue is with the original concept. Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't really see what 5 levels of Ranger brings to the party. Dual-wield, yes, but without ITWF it's a bit dodgy. It only brings 2 FEs and means you have to start with WIS 11 as a minimum. 5 Fighter levels would give 3 bonus feats and grants the possibility of WS for damage. Is it about having Hide and MS as class skills, so you can take the other classes earlier?<br/>\n<br/>\nI merely seek enlightenment.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The improved version IS better, but your points are valid. Doing it this way DOES save some skill points , but as I was reading the build, I noticed the lack of ITWF and thought to myself that though I'd like to try this build, I'd want to somehow get ITWF, and 5 fighter could make that happen, but then yes...one would want the WS, and then probably EPWS...:)\u00a0 SO it would cost some assassin levels in the long run.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">The original build was never good, but then again these were from 2004 (Athens Olympics), the game was still receiving patches &amp; they needed an advertisement for it with all the possibilities the new 3rd edition D&amp;D was bringing to the table, so the official power-builds were created &amp; supported by the company.\u00a0 These were perhaps, a recreation of the famous min/max forums in WotC where the true power-builds were created, the uber-charger, jack-be-quick, cheater of mystra, pun-pun &amp; others, to name a few. Anyway, Ranger is there because is the only full-bab class with the skills available to have shadow-dancer &amp; assassin the earliest possible, twf was just an additional perk that made him even more compelling. I think that regardless from the original build's potential, Mick made a pretty good job with it, while staying true to its origin. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for those who want to see what it looked like back then, here is a link for you (scroll down),<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20080214233419/http://forums.gleemax.com/showthread.php?t=401662\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://web.archive.org/web/200802142334 ... p?t=401662</a><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

But with BAB +16 at lvl 20 this character has 5 attacks per round while dual wielding. That is the same as a pure 3/4 BAB build with ITWF.<br/>\nIf you try this build with Fighter, both Assassin and SD come much later. That will hurt the Death Attack DC. <br/>\nIf you take 9 levels of Ranger for ITWF and 10 levels of SD for ED, you get the same problem. So with these classes it is either ITWF or ED if you want a high Death Attack DC.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Right, the original build lacked focus, you can see that from the multiple things he tries to accomplish &amp; one of them was to boost his death attack DC by upping his intelligence. My guess is that Mick wanted to stay true to the original &amp; also raise his DC as much as possible, since 40/40 (first flurry, twf) ab for someone who (ideally) attacks to flat-footed enemies will be enough in most cases. The original build had a death attack DC of 36, while Mick has achieved a DC of 39 which is a substantial increase over the original. Do note, however, that Mick has more effective assassins in his stable, like the (in)famous, \"kama shinobi\".<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
