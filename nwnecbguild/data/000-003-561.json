      "content": "<div>Hello again, ladies and gents!<br/>\n<br/>\nWith the last build that I received from Empyre, I took it through the OC with a friend and I was super impressed (thanks again Empyre).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis time, I'm trying to build a detective-type Rogue character for said friend (able to investigate well with all of the proper environmental and social skills, so higher-than-normal INT), but I'm having a few issues.\u00a0 It's DEX-based and dual-wielding, which is fantastic vs single targets, but the main issue is when there're trash mobs; the build is 100% capable of dealing with them but spends a LOT of extra time taking out larger groups of small enemies, either having to take them out one at a time, or stacking a bunch of traps and luring them in.\u00a0 This is especially prevalent when fighting an undead horde... sneak attack immunity is a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother issue I'm running into is getting max APR with certain approaches.\u00a0 The build calls for 4 APR, which means 16+ BAB before lvl 20.\u00a0 Splashing any Wizard levels with Rogue pre-epic (to take advantage of higher INT for all of the skills in the build, as well as add some versatility) majorly cuts into BAB progression, almost guaranteeing an APR of 3.\u00a0 The only way I could avoid this was investing at least 8 levels into a warrior class, like Fighter or Ranger, before lvl 20.\u00a0 Similarly, this means the max amount of Rogue levels before lvl 20 would be 16, with a 4 level warrior splash.<br/>\n<br/>\nSomething else to note is that I've looked at quite a few builds using the search engine.\u00a0 None of them 100% fit what I'm trying to achieve.\u00a0 Either they're an APR short or much of the diversity/power comes rather late... I'd rather have the build fully capable across all levels.\u00a0 If it weren't for these factors, the Ferromancer by\u00a0Mithdradates would've made an excellent match, especially with the whole Darkness sneak attack cheese.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut anyway, on to the request!\u00a0 If a build already exists that fits the below criteria that I've missed (quite possible), I apologize in advance:<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>1)\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">PvM</span>\u00a0</strong>- Like the last build, it'll be going through the OC, expansions, Infinite Dungeons, and newer DLCs (when applicable, starting over at lvl 1), sometimes solo, sometimes not.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>2)\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Level Cap</span></strong>\u00a0- 40; requesting for build to be fully playable and enjoyable from 1-40 if at all possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>3)\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Race Preference</span></strong>\u00a0- Human.\u00a0 Keeping it simple.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>4)\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Class Preference</span></strong>\u00a0- Rogue would fit best with the archetype in question.\u00a0 As stated above, Wizard wouldn't be a bad mix-in if I could get the BAB issue to work... but really, anything goes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>5)\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Melee Preference</span></strong>\u00a0- Dual-wielding, DEX-based, high AC, Epic Dodge if possible but not required.\u00a0 I don't see a \"detective\" using a shield or a bow.\u00a0 Hell, even unarmed would be doable.\u00a0 I'm also aiming for 16+ BAB by lvl 20 to make sure they get 4 APR.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>6)\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Range Preference</span>\u00a0</strong>- Eh, if they use range, it'll more than likely be in a pinch, so maybe a crossbow for extra damage, or a sling or darts to keep the total equipment weight down.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>7)\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Weapon Preference</span></strong>\u00a0- Kukris maybe?\u00a0 Or daggers?\u00a0 I can't see a \"detective\" type of character using a two-hander, or even a medium-sized weapon, really.\u00a0 Something light and easily concealed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>8)\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Maximum Item Enhancement</span>\u00a0</strong>- It depends on the module being used.\u00a0 Like the other build, this will be played through all of the officially released content.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>9)\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Spellcasting</span></strong>\u00a0- None required, but always welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>10)\u00a0<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Custom Factors</span></strong>\u00a0- OC, expansions, and DLC constraints.\u00a0 Also, like the other build, I'm trying to avoid alignment change requirements.\u00a0 Speaking of alignment, we're aiming for LN; that's the type of character they want to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, a big thank you in advance for any and all advice given.\u00a0 It's very much appreciated!\u00a0\u00a0<span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83d\ude42</span><br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. For reference, a snippet of the portrait they'll be using is attached, maybe for a bit of inspiration as well.</div>"

      "content": "<div>There's a fair bit to break down in your request, so I guess if I were to attempt to summarise it for clarity:<br/>\n<br/>\nYou're after a 'detective' type character, with 'environment and social skills' (which at the very least calls for decent Intelligence), Dexterity focus + Dual Wielding, max APR, and possibly Wizard levels thrown in.<br/>\n<br/>\nMay I recommend ditching the idea of taking Wizard if you're after Max APR on a duel wielding Rogue. Go for either 3 APR + Wizard levels, or 4 APR + No wizard levels. The only way to reconcile the two ideas would be to go something like \"Rogue 8\u00a0 Wizard 4 Fighter 8\" pre-epic, and then I guess move into something like \"Rogue 13 Wizard 17 Fighter 10\" by level 40 ... which would be underwhelming both at melee and at spellcasting. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're worried about trash mobs as a duel wielding Rogue, throwing in some Shadowdancer levels can help you a lot, as this will allow you to stealth without having to be hidden behind terrain first. Alternatively, if you fancy taking some Monk levels, you could forgo Shadowdancer in favour of just speedily hiding behind terrain whenever you get into trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nGiven your description, I'd suggest \"Rogue/Shadowdancer/X\" as your class combination, perhaps with 16 int, with \"X\" being a High BAB class of some sort. You could go Rogue/SD/Fighter, Rogue/SD/Ranger, Rogue/SD/CoT, Rogue/SD/Paladin, Rogue/SD/Monk (with kamas), the list goes on.<br/>\n<br/>\nI quite like Ranger23/Rogue16/SD1 with duel daggers, but if you choose 'the wrong' favoured enemies for a particular environment it can miss out on some damage opportunities. Though for PvM, it's probably safe to just choose 'typically critical hit immune' enemies such as Undead/Constructs/etc.</div>"
