      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Attention-grabbing headline, but for a worthy cause, I trust.<br/>\n<br/>\n I was reading Mick Dagger's Elven Kama-Shinobi (Monk 9/Assassin 26/SD 5) build and had a gripe about only evil guys and gals being Assassins ('primarily because it's a wonderful construction). Thus, I vowed to come up with a suitable build to stand on the right side of the night and match him/her.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, I'm not saying I've failed (yet), but I could do with some assistance against the forces of Darkness. Thus far, I've established that a certain synergy does exist, in that the Monk 9 and Shadowdancer 5 should remain constant, with Ranger 26 replacing the Assassin levels. Equally, I can get Dodge, Mobility, Finesse and WF:Kama in the build pre-epic, leading to Epic Dodge in Epic. Ranger being Ranger, I don't have to worry about Ambidexterity, 2 Weapon-Fighting and its big brother, so can replace them with Blind Fighting, Imp Crit and (probably) Luck of Heroes (to help with saves).<br/>\n<br/>\n I will, of course, also get at least 2 Favoured Enemies pre-epic, but herein lies my request for assistance. While my instinct is to go Ranger 10/ Monk 9/ Shadowdancer 1 pre-epic, I'm not sure that it's any better than Ranger 9/ Monk 9/ Shadowdancer 2, Ranger 10/ Monk 6/ Shadowdancer 4, or Ranger 9/ Monk 6/ Shadowdancer 5, and my head's beginning to hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, once again taking my lead from Minsc - always a good reference point for sensible character choices -\u00a0 is it the case that goodness must be <em>seen</em> to kick bad men in the evils, or should his other aphorism hold true - \"Night time, good for sneaking up on evil!\". In other words, do I not fully load Hide and Move Silently - perhaps giving room for Spellcraft and Discipline? (I can't get UMD or Trap skills either, so maybe there's room for stealth as well as the aforementioned).<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm currently, and fairly obviously, in concept development mode, but I hope and trust the forces of righteous butt-kicking will come to my aid.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Damn it, I tried linking to Mick's build, but failed several times. Not sure what I'm doing wrong, it's worked before...</em><br/>\n<br/>\n EDIT: I know Empyre gave me the shorthand way of doing this, but let's see if it works longhand. The link to Mick's build is: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2350791/KamaShinobi-Monk-9-Assassin-26-SD-5#.Vvc0_TFnEqg\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/23 ... vc0_TFnEqg</a><br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The 3/4 classes like Monk and SD (and some others) get +0 BAB first, then 3 levels of +1 BAB, and then +0 again, and so on. Because of this, you should have a multiple of 4 levels of each such class pre-epic. In epic levels, you get +1 BAB every other level no matter what class you take. So, in this build, you should either wait until epic levels to take SD, or take 4 levels of SD pre-epic. Ranger 10 / Monk 6 / SD 4 would work because the 9th and 10th levels of Ranger would complete the set of 4 started by Monk 5 and 6. You would wind up with a BAB of 17 at level 20, which is 1 more than enough to get your last attack.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Good thoughts, all. Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Mick: I dare say you're right, but my problem (one among my many problems) here is that I've never played a cleric, and I do like to play the builds. It's bad enough that I'm not by inclination a stealther and I'm trying to build one, but to have 2 classes I'm unfamiliar with might be pushing things a bit far.<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Hip: I've had a look at Kaliban99's Kama Fury, and it does look interesting. I'm not entirely sure that the +1AC given by Monk 10 is superior to the additional bonus feat Ranger 26 gives, but that's a minor point.<br/>\n<br/>\n I have been giving it some more thought, to refine what I'm looking for if I'm to mirror Mick's build. Obviously, it'll be more of a circus Hall of Mirrors than an exact reflection, but here's my thinking so far, including the parameters (admittedly arbitrary ones) I'm making myself work within. While I agree that Halfling would be a great choice, I fear that I have to stick with Elf, along with the same starting stats (doing a sort of \"two brothers who took a different fork in the road\" routine). Early on, I think it has to be Ranger in order to reach Imp 2-Weapon Fighting asap, as I tend not to dual-wield until I have that feat. It also fits with the idea of a slow strip for early protection - start in leathers or med armour, probably even with a shield, and end up in naught but a chiffon blouse. This naturally has implications for when SD becomes a useful option, and I'm now thinking I might leave it until Epic, and then race to get ED asap. Thus, I'm thinking maybe Ranger 16 / Monk 4 in pre-epic (which will also help with BAB. What I'll lack in AC I'll make up for in firepower. I hope.). If I understand correctly, this will mean an xp penalty, but that's something I don't think I can avoid with this construction anyway (while remaining committed to Elf, that is). Then blast in with the 5 SD levels and 4 more Monk (leaving 1 for a final Tumble dump at L37).<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> On reflection, perhaps 10 Monk levels and 25 Ranger would be a good idea after all. That way I can get Imp Evasion earlier as well as the +1AC, and I only really need BoE, Epic Prowess and EWF as Ranger bonus feats in epic.<br/>\n<br/>\n Does any of this sound viable, or am I wasting everyone's time?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">IMO, the reason Mnk 10/Rgr 25 is better than Mnk 9/Rgr 26 on slow-leveling environment is because you can get Epic Dodge much sooner.\u00a0 Qualifying for ED and the final dump level do not need to coincide and force ED back so far it hardly gets used at all.\u00a0 Just the access to Ki Strike means nothing at all to the build mechanics.\u00a0 It is at the cost of another FE but as long as BoE is there at a reasonable point in the build, I don't think you'll miss the +1 damage as much as ED at 30..\u00a0 The same rationale goes for cleric 26 as well, so choose wisely.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n However, if this toon is planned for Level 40+ server, stick with the minimum reqs for ED and grab the extra feat. For servers like that, you design as if your starting toon was Level 40 (which is what Kaliban pretty much echoed in his comments).\u00a0 Fast-leveling environs tend to be high-magic so you can factor that into the mix as well.\u00a0 On high-magic, typically ALL types of spellcasters (including self-buffers) suffer badly.<br/>\n<br/>\n Design Rule #1 never changes: Always design for the environment.<br/>\n<br/>\n That means the better you define the intended setting, the easier it is to optimize for that situation.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

(Throughout, the FEs depend on environment)<br/>\n Level 7: Monk (1)<br/>\n Level 8-10: Ranger (7-9), with WF:Kama (L9)<br/>\n Level 11-12: Monk (2-3), with Imp Crit:Kama (L12)<br/>\n Level 13-16: Ranger (10-13), with Dodge (L15)<br/>\n Level 17: Monk (4)<br/>\n Level 18-20: Ranger (14-16), with Mobility (L18)<br/>\n Level 21-22: SD (1-2), with GDEX I (L21)<br/>\n Level 23-24: Monk (5-6), with GDEX II (L24)<br/>\n Level 25-27: SD (3-5), with GDEX III (L27)<br/>\n Level 28-30: Monk (7-9), with ED (L30)<br/>\n Level 31-37: Ranger (17-23), with GDEX IV (L33), GDEX V (L36), and EWF and BoE at either L34 or L37<br/>\n Level 38: Monk (10)<br/>\n Level 39-40: Ranger (24-25), with GDEX VI (L39) and EProwess (L40)<br/>\n<br/>\n The stats are as Mick's build: STR10, DEX 18(34), CON12, WIS14, INT14, CHA8.<br/>\n HPs: 410<br/>\n AC: 34<br/>\n +30% speed<br/>\n BAB: 29<br/>\n AB (max): 45 (melee), 41 (ranged)<br/>\n Dual-Wield Kama: 43/40/37/34/31 (main hand) 43/38 (off-hand)<br/>\n Skills - 268: Disc 43 (43), Hide 43 (45), Move Silently 43 (45), Search 20 (22), Spellcraft 18 (20), Spot 43 (45), Tum 40 (52)<br/>\n Saves (bit low for my liking): F24/R32/W19<br/>\n<br/>\n Of course, there are choices to weigh - the main one being whether to go for ED earlier, at the expense of EWF and BoE, or the other way around. At the moment, I lean towards ED first, but I'm happy to be convinced otherwise. (I will, of course, make it look acceptable once I get your thoughts in - assuming they aren't simply \"bin it, it's crap\".)<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, as it stands, does it look halfway reasonable, or halfway toilet?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Sorry, Hip, you must have posted as I was pulling the above together - I wasn't ignoring you!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

They tend to sulk.\u00a0 Focusing on a particular save (like Iron Will) is an item-dependent decision.\u00a0 Are there immunity to mind-affecting items?\u00a0 Are clarity potions easy to find?\u00a0\u00a0 Reflex saves are probably the ones with the most overall value with ImpEvasion since you can avoid most all the evocation spell damage.\u00a0 It can be tough to decide which save type will hang you out to dry on failure without some knowledge of which creatures are most proliferated.\u00a0 On the last server I played, there were loads of high-level monks spamming Quivering Palm so to get through the area your toon needed Fort as high as possible to engage successfully.\u00a0 Just one example, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n FE is easy to understand, hard to decide.\u00a0 Each time you take an FE add +1 to damage.\u00a0 It's cumulative.\u00a0 So choosing FE 5 times means +5 damage and the damage type is the same as the weapon type (i.e. slashing for kama).\u00a0 As you add to the list, every FE selected is treated the same.\u00a0 Same damage now and then increases with each new FE added.\u00a0 I believe FE damage crits (like WS) but don't hold me to that fact.\u00a0 It's been a while since I tested a ranger so memory fades.<br/>\n<br/>\n Which race(s) to choose is the hard part because it depends on what is generally the biggest p.i.t.a to kill. That is usually environment-specific.\u00a0 Some folks choose all the crit immunes.\u00a0 Some choose the races that spawn as the largest mobs. Some choose the most common races like humans, elves &amp; dwarves.\u00a0 Some choose the races that are most typically associated with high-level spellcasting.\u00a0 It just depends on your playstyle.\u00a0 I have no problem with mobs because I will pull them apart so would likely go with crit immunes or dragons.<br/>\n<br/>\n The reason it is so important to chose wisely is because BoE not only gives more damage but +2 AB.\u00a0 So, races with high AC should be on the FE list.\u00a0 In other words, if you are hitting certain races well enough before you get BoE, then BoE is less benificial vs. those races because it's not really needed. And that means you will need to anticipate and plan ahead which is easier said than done if you have no knowledge of the realm you are about to scout.<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
