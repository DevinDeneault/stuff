Also the spot doesn't seem like enough to matter so could sprinkle that somewhere else<br/>\n<br/>\n Last thing is I really wish I could figure out where to put in the last point of con for a 22 con score. might actually be worth it to just hit 22 before moving back to bumping str up....

      "content": "<div>Ahhh... so he created the toon as a rogue and is try to rebuild from 2.\u00a0 I see.\u00a0 Thanks for reorienting me, Empyre. ;)\u00a0 I am in your debt, as usual.\u00a0 His comment about \"current level\" is what threw me off. That's a shame due to losing the Tumble and UMD benefits by delaying a few more levels.\u00a0 Ces't la vie!<br/>\n<br/>\n In light of the revelation that this toon may be adopting a solo role rather than what was originally intended (party tank), you'll be forced to compensate for low AB that continues well into epic.<br/>\n<br/>\n Expertise will be useful in some situations but I doubt Improved Expertise will help much with an effective AB of 8 at Level 15.\u00a0 Perhaps PA/Cleave is the better choice since you'll get an attack at full BAB (AB 18 at that point) and can trigger while in Defensive Stance mode (Expertise turned off) and gain that much-needed AB.\u00a0 TBH, toggling between Expertise and Defensive Stance is very buggy.\u00a0 If you check the combat log, many times the bonuses won't apply after coming out of Expertise but the immobility makes it appear like they should.\u00a0 I recommend you test this in a trainer before getting too reliant on the published claims.<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>to clarify, Full rebuild/recreation of previous character. so not even lvl 1 is fixed. In fact the current build i'm wanting to recreate was fighter/dwd so starting with rogue at level 1 is a full rebuild. just trying to keep close to the original intent of the character despite the build actually being made for a different server. I'm trying to get the remake to allow the character to properly flourish with the new server instead of butting my head against mechanics of the current server because my build was for a previous one.</div>"

Other than that, I think your build is fine for your purpose as-is.</div>",
