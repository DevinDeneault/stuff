Was going to go with Aasimar subrace: -2 str and con, +4 to wis and cha.\u00a0 As the server states the max level was thought to be unlimited - even though one person had their toon reach lvl 2100+ (must have taken years - I have been on the server for several months and have a monk with 135 million exp only at level 530)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut looking to run with solo if no one else is logged on. Also at level 50 and every 25 levels there afterwards, 2 ability points can be placed on any stat. Mid level server +10 for armor / weapons. Abilities increase as levels post 40 increase.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Greetings Luck_Dragon!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the goals are survivable, you have decent saves and 500hp+ plus freedom/death ward so I believe you can say you have achieved that.<br/>\nRE Planar Turning, in my mind you can take that feat sooner at level 36 perhaps<br/>\nPower Attack requires Str 13+ so this will need to be pushed backward in your build order.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately I have little experience with Planar Turning so I cannot comment about that<br/>\n<br/>\nPossible tweaks\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>I am curious about the high investment in Paladin, is this something related to your environment, or are you worried about getting dispelled\nThe base AB target is very much environment specific and I believe you or another player more familiar with the environment will be the best judge of this\nAnother thought I had was why Fighter? Was it the bonus feats?\nOther options I thought of:\nRanger 1 epic levels gives you a bonus feat (for Epic Prowess for example) and place to skill dump detection, trapping and search skills\nMonk will give you wisdom AC and Evasion, you can also drop your armor and shield, Tumble as a class skill for extra AC\nHope these ideas help you.\n</details></div>"

As for planar turning - on the server I run on, you just do not turn undead / planar you destroy them.
