      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hello Mighty ECBers!\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst and foremost, I feel a strong obligation to point out that yours is probably the greatest community I've ever encountered on the Internet (not that I've been a member of that many ones tbh... but still...) You people are great!\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nStag, Mick, Orion, Empyre, Valerfor, DontPlayAnymore and others (sorry guys but you are quite many to list all of you:)... I've been following this community for 6 months by now (spent them in a remote corner of Africa without any proper access to the Internet, hence reading was the only option) and I've been amazed not only by the vast knowledge of the game collected by you, distinguished sirs, but also by how this community functions and lives: in harmony but with a healthy spirit of competition, with readiness to give each other a hand but in constant search of the truth (i.e. powaaa building;)...\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you, guys, for everything you've accomplished here together and separately!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I probably should've taken all this to the Introductions but... can't wait to request a character (besides it's been sometime since anybody published a new build - correct me if I'm wrong;). So following the guidelines by Kail:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) PvM; I plan to take this char on a quest through all the original content and then modules like SoF, Aielund Saga, MoTS, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Level cap - 40 but I'd also appreciate the adjustments for different playthroughs depending on the modules and what they offer in terms of level cap.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Race preference - human or maybe elf.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Class preference - I've been thinking a strength-based assassin with nice AB and Saves (I have a thing for those - them being below 20+ raises concerns in me) and it came to my attention that there are no builds that would include Bard, Blackguard and Assassin. Do you think it can and/or should be remedied?<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Melee preference - Dual-wielding. It is something that I'd call my guilty pleasure: I understand that irl the concept holds no feasibility unless it's a sword/saber/rapier and a short dagger combo and even then it's not every swordsman's cup of tea but NWN is a fantasy RPG, right? I also can predict comments on how the build could be feat-starved because a nice Bard song and ability to sneak in Full Plate are something I'd want in the build as well. But, perhaps, there is a way to circumvent it?<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Range preference -\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n7) Weapon preference - I know that a shortsword or kukri\u00a0 must be here but... scimitars (c'mon who doesn't want, at least at some point of their nwn-life, to build a character based on Drizzt? Well, in this case let's overlook the alignment differences.)\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n8) Maximum item enhancement - I guess this depends on the modules mentioned above?<br/>\n<br/>\n9) Spellcasting - Bard goodies are nice to have but they shouldn't be the focus of the build. I would rather they were treated as a supplementary tool in the build's arsenal (Darkness seems a good way to replace HiPS; Blank Mind and Dispells would be most useful I guess?). A nice bard song is a welcome, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe build that got me inspired is this one\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=515486&amp;p=167&amp;hilit=devastating+assassin#p167\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=515486&amp;p=167&amp;hilit ... assin#p167</a>\u00a0 It has it flaws, I know. The reason I thought about substituting fighter with BG is the saves and BG's synergy with bard's spellcasting; and bard is there primarily because bards have access to MS and Hide and, unlike rangers, can be evil (at least in my books).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo that's it. I really look forward to your suggestions and I hope you don't find the build's concept too absurd.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It probably rocks on the open battlefield but lacks this shadow-skulker vibe. I was looking for an assassin who has no problem dealing with everything immune to DA/SA but with higher saves than assassin-builds I've seen here usually have. Add a bit of bard's magic and singing to the mix and you get a sneaky-spellsword of a sort and I personally have a weak spot for those.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to throw a kukri at me if I'm being too finicky.<img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

To become one with the nature, one must take a spiritual journey that changes anyone who walks it completely and\u00a0irreversibly. I admit that in a particular story you can make your ranger evil by means of a curse or the ranger's getting mad about a devastation of nature or something like that. However, even then that drastic shift of alignment could only be temporary until the curse was lifted or the ranger found their way back to the inner calm they had before this way or another. Btw, in case of a curse scenario the ranger is supposed to loos their connection with nature, the way I see it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, I know that this is only applicable from RP point of view but I really can't turn a blind eye to this.\u00a0<img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">The problem with the Night Raider, I'm afraid, is the same as with Subtle Death, in that Agadris doesn't want an evil Ranger (bloody principles, eh?).<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get to the bones of the request, though, and taking the feat-starvation in a potential dual-wielding Bard/ BG/ Ass build as a given. Be it human, elf, dwarf, gnome, anything else, you'll need a minimum of 8 levels of Bard before you can take a level in BG (min BAB 6+), or 5 before you can take a level of Assassin (min Hide/ MS 8+) - and if you go for Assassin first that makes it at least 10th level before BG becomes available. And if you want to make best use of BG you'll need reasonable Charisma (which at least has some synergy with Bard). Then you'll need reasonable Dexterity (15+) for Ambidexterity. And then you want a decent Intelligence for both Death Attack DC and available skills. Oh yes, and a bucket-load of Strength. So the build runs the risk of being spread too thin to do anything well, sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my very amateur opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Ninja'd. But I'll let it stand<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT 2: Sorry, forgot to mention feats and AB. With this proposed combination there are only the standard 7 available feats pre-epic (8 if going human). Presumably you'll be wanting all 3 dual-wielding ones, Weapon Focus, Power Attack - if you want Divine Might and/or Shield, which would fill all but one spot if human, and all if not. That means flipping a coin between Blind Fight, Knockdown, Imp Crit, and anything else. And if you want the full 4 attacks per round you'll need at least 16 pre-epic BAB, which also puts severe restrictions on which classes you can take, and when.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Of course, if going elf, you could focus in longsword or rapier.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think the single weapon option would work better with the classes you want.

However, if you want to progress as an assassin, you cannot allow an alignment shift to happen. I don't know how easy or difficult it is for it to happen on the servers (maybe you don't have to interact with the environment that much so your dialogue choices can't really affect your alignment; I've never played on PWs tbh) but in a singleplayer sometimes you can't avoid going for purely 'evil' choices.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this leads to that you can't really roleplay an evil character who seeks redemption in their sometimes very biased ways or who fights 'greater' evil in a Machiavellian style because of the options are 'I want to rob this guy', 'I want to murder this guy for no obvious reason simply because I'm evil', 'I won't help this guy because he is weak' and so on.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nWriters rarely allow you not to rob the guy because money is something you don't really care about since you are sure that you'll get plenty of it after killing some local province-grade villains. They rarely allow you to just pass by the guy without killing him or to just scare the hell out of him so that he never-ever tries to cross you again. And you can never justify that you agreed to help a weak one because your hatred towards his offenders was greater than your contempt towards the guy.<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably one of the best examples of a pragmatic evil behavior is Shepard murdering that batarian engineer in cold blood on the mission to get the old Vakarian out of trouble and off the Omega.<img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The build also has 10 spare skill points.\u00a0<br/>\nIf you have access to true seeing, Listen is best. If not, I prefer Spot in an assassin build. Spot makes you see hiding creatures within line of sight. Listen reveals creatures behind walls and moving creatures trying to stalk you, but hiding, static creatures tend to disappear once they enter your line of sight.<br/>\nYou want to take your main detection skill early so you have it available throughout your game. Your excess skill points will come in epic levels. That is why I take Listen so late. This build has a low dex bonus and will need many ranks in trap setting and lock opening. Dex builds are better at that. You can always allocate a couple of skill points early on to unlock the skills if you want to dabble in the arts, but you will not be good at it before late in epic levels.<br/>\nIf I should play this build, I would resort to casting Knock and Detect traps instead of using thievery skills, either from a wand or from scrolls.<br/>\nYou are right about Concentration and Taunt. The reason why I don't take it here, is because it is only a class skill up to level 24 and excess skillpoints only become available later. And I don't want to give it priority over Discipline, Hide, Move silently, Spot, Tumble and UMD.
