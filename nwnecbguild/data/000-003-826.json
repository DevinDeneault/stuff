      "content": "<div>heading off to work so I'm going to be brief<br/>\n<br/>\ntactics - Max's guide on playing well. its here in the ECB forum somewhere. ranged weapon to agro them, run back a bit, then take out enemies one by one, if you can. 'Pull and Slay or Run away'<br/>\n<br/>\nstrong classes - spoke to a few players about this cleric and druids with dragon shape are probably the strongest classes on the server. animal domain clerics and druids have slightly stronger summons, which helps with early levels but become weaker later on. spellcasters are strong if you are good at them. a bard/rdd/cot will be tough to level up at the beginning but then will bloom later. undispellable buffs are very valuable, every second man and his dog casts greater dispelling (im exaggerating but you get the idea)<br/>\n<br/>\nskills - UMD is valuable. consider open lock (1 point plus tools) as bashed chests sometimes have their contents degraded. listen or spot skills are valuable as almost every enemy seems to use stealth. search to 10 modified to find hidden entrances and doors</div>"
