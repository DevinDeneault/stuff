I am just wondering which one you guys think is the best option in your opinion or if anyone has their own that might be better? Thanks guys for your help.<br/>\n \u00a0Some server changes are, PM loses 1AC at first lvl and 1 every 4 lvls after that and AA Death Arrow: The DC has been changed to 20 + 1 per AA lvl.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Of the 3 on the search engine ghosts edr version intrigues me the most then Evo's dexer. But I'm not sure about their (yes both) feats srrms like something's amiss. I don't think I like the -a.c. deal your srvet has going on either but it is what it is. I think I'd toss in another bard level early epic (22ish) <br/>\n Just yo be a little more payable (disc, umd, tum dump) of course if it's born at 40  that's not needed.I would drop 1 aa level for it so you keep both of the pm and aa bonus feats. <br/>\n I'll dig deeper when I'm not busy.<br/>\n Edit: apologizing for bad spelling cruising down road and cell phone screen is small.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Ghost's version is sure more intriguing, here are a couple of changes i would do to this,<br/>\n<br/>\n a) replace toughness with called shot and,<br/>\n b) replace great dexterity I with epic prowess<br/>\n c) start with 16 dex - 10 str to finish on the same total dex (22)<br/>\n<br/>\n This way you will have 4 attacks (i am looking at the corrected version) and 45 AB which it can also be boosted 9/day with bard song (+2 AB). Then, if going for PvP i would also substitute EMA with Epic Warding. Pre-epic change order of the improved critical and rapid shot feats too.<br/>\n<br/>\n One of the pro's Ghost's archer has is also the higher fortitude save if that is of any concern.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">For a build with 19 as levels yes but probably manageable nowhere dies it say it's a high ab build it'll make some fights longer than need be. Soo. I'd switch some feats tho. I'd move (pre epic) to something like this <br/>\n 1blindfight (get it out of the way early)<br/>\n 3weapon finesse (playability)<br/>\n 6weapon pro martial<br/>\n 9p.b.s.<br/>\n 12weapon focus long bow<br/>\n 15called shot <br/>\n 18) limp crit long bow ( I'm personally not a fan of rapid shot )<br/>\n Toughness was dropped but build still ends with over 500 hps.<br/>\n Epic  I'd shuffle some aa levels sooner and the pm levels down to pick up Ema and epic warding. Dropping the sonic damage reduction should be more tgsn a fair tradeoff. <br/>\n<br/>\n It was my anniversary this weekend so I wasn't err allowed to play or re-evaluate it properly like I said Iwwould these are quick changes/suggestions to improve durability and playability.<br/>\n<br/>\n Edit 1:Just saw valerfor post must now find corrected version. Darn it lol.<br/>\n Edit2: think I'll stick with what I said but mix in valerfors suggestions as well.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

(Ok so I forgot the early epic bard lvl) <br/>\n<br/>\n 1B1   (blindfight)<br/>\n 2B2<br/>\n 3B3   (point blank shot)  afaik it works with xbows which is your w.o.c. until lvl 6.<br/>\n 4P1<br/>\n 5P2<br/>\n 6P3   (weapon pro martial) here's your bow<br/>\n 7P4<br/>\n 8P5<br/>\n 9P6   (weapon focus longbow)<br/>\n 10B4<br/>\n 11A1<br/>\n 12A2  (called shot)<br/>\n 13A3<br/>\n 14A4<br/>\n 15A5  (rapid shot) you are an archer so..<br/>\n 16A6<br/>\n 17A7<br/>\n 18A8  (improved critical: longbow)<br/>\n 19A9<br/>\n 20A10<br/>\n ------ <br/>\n 21P7  (edr1)<br/>\n 22P8  <br/>\n 23P9<br/>\n 24P10 (edr2)<br/>\n 25A11<br/>\n 26A12<br/>\n 27A13 (edr3)<br/>\n 28A14 {epic weapon focus: longbow}<br/>\n 29P11<br/>\n 30P12 (epic prowess)<br/>\n 31P13 * pm bonus feat Idk the list *<br/>\n 32P14<br/>\n 33P15 (epic warding)<br/>\n 34A15<br/>\n 35A16<br/>\n 36P16 (armor skin) *e.m.a.*<br/>\n 37A17<br/>\n 38A18 {great dex 1}<br/>\n 39A19 (great dex 2)<br/>\n 40B5 <br/>\n<br/>\n Probably would flip lvl 1 &amp; lvl 6 feats .
