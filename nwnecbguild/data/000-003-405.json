      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">On the player world im on,everything works fine until you get to the epic area,s...then most creatures saves are through the roof,leaving any caster,s even my tweaked version of Maximilian,s Demolition man lacking on any offence,and ,I dunno about you but buffing and healing, doesn't do it for me one bit!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo background RP bit,this char will eventually be re-skinned as a pixie,however it will retain its base race qualities,im basically going to RP her as someone,s familiar <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I have scoured here and the search engine,cant see one that fit,s but as I have never actually played a caster beyond lvl 3 at the most,i need good advice!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have narrowed it down too some must have selection,s<br/>\n<br/>\nMust be wizard,the ability to change spells is a must.<br/>\nMust be a generalist,i need all the spells!<br/>\nNo real melee presence required,i,ll plink with a Xbow or something if needed<br/>\nAs she is going to be a pixie,I thought rogue would be most fitting as a tumble,UMD class,but perhaps bard?<br/>\nHer main thing will be no save spell,s so on hunting for them ,the Isacc,s line,bigby,s etc...a good list of these would be really helpful,as i said,im a novice at the arcane!<br/>\nWould like Epic mage armour and Epic warding...1-2 other epic spell,s would be nice too,hopefully a meatshield,[dragon knight get,s a boost on the server!]<br/>\nTrueseeing is prevalent on high lvl bosses<br/>\nBrew potion and scribe scroll do not work<br/>\n+5 gear is relatively easy too get,but on a blue moon ,sometime,s upto +9 will descend from the heaven,s <br/>\nBase race doesn't matter as she will look like a pixie,so whichever get,s the most benefit really,I was leaning towards gnome or halfling,but you may know better,i know the skin will give her small size and faster speed,but i don't know if the bonii from this will take affect...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the best lvl spread will be Wizard 37-38   and Tumble/UMD class 2-3  but this is why im asking here,I need help! and badly!<br/>\n<br/>\nHer normal spell,s will work fine until the early ,mid 20,s afaik,after that it,s no-saves and the occasional weakspot hit.So,lots of int for lots of slots please <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically she will be in a party most of the time,her tactics buff her teammate,s and get with the no-save artillery,help with lock,s i suppose for rp, and look cute!    <br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said,im new too the arcane world,especially a niche like this,any help gratefully received!<br/>\n<br/>\nYrs Greyfey<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Well, no-save for a high-level caster is a bit of a waste of potential. However, if that is the case, you can swap the spell focus feats from one of my builds and use it as reference. You can get auto-still spell and wear a full plate, or some if not all the epic spells. Here's a link to the build:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/boddyknock-ginckle-wizard-35-fighter-2-rogue-3-t2269098.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/boddy ... 69098.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHe focuses on 2 spellcasting schools, so there is room for many tweaks there if you get rid of the spell focus line of feats. Up to you to decide what to put in there: epic spells, expertise, great fortitude, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Let me ask this - it sounds like a somewhat higher magic world, which I'm familiar with.  Have the spells damage been scaled to move past their base or upped in anyway?  I just ask because many higher magic worlds with lots of melee bonuses, the spells have to be scaled to provide any balance at all.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
