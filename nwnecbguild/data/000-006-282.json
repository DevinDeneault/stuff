It is inspired by the legendary Beowulf, Prince of Geats, from the old English poem (as translated by Nobel Laureate Seamus Heaney). This build is also the first of what is hoped to be a multi-character series inspired by Old Norse/Germanic Hero tales, which series Beowulf kicks off. <br/>\n<br/>\nGr\u00fcss Gott, and may the legends of Beowulf live on ~ Tyr. </div></blockquote>\n<strong>Concept:</strong> From out of the moor, Grendel, the monstrous troll, appeared from the mist and headed to the mead hall, hungry. He ripped open the door of the hall and entered to see the sleeping warriors, with only but one man standing. That man was Beowulf, a hero and Prince of the Geats. Beowulf watched on while Grendel reached out for an unlucky warrior and ate him. He reached next out for our hero, salivating, at which point Beowulf grabbed onto Grendel's clawed hand and held tight. Surprised at the strength of the mortal\u2019s grip upon him, Grendel attempted to flee, but Beowulf held fast. Awakened, the warriors watched as the struggle between Beowulf and the murderous beast shook the mead-hall; they watched as Beowulf pulled Grendel\u2019s arm clear of its socket, and they heard Grendel cry out in imminent defeat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe warriors rejoiced: Beowulf, it was agreed by all, was a hero fit to become king.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Beowulf (Prince of Geats), <br/>\nBarbarian(16), Champion of Torm(18), Fighter(6)</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>I Attributes:</strong><br/>\nSTR: 18 (34)<br/>\nDEX: 10<br/>\nCON: 14<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman, Non-Lawful  (Theme: CG)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>II Level Guide:</strong><br/>\n01: Barbarian(1): luck of heroes, power attack<br/>\n02: Fighter(1): cleave**<br/>\n03: Fighter(2): knockdown, weapon focus: longsword<br/>\n04: Fighter(3): STR+1, (STR=19)<br/>\n05: Barbarian(2): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br/>\n06: Fighter(4): great cleave**, weapon specialization: longsword<br/>\n07: Barbarian(3)<br/>\n08: Barbarian(4): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n09: Barbarian(5): skill focus: intimidate, OR, Expertise<br/>\n10: Champion of Torm(1)<br/>\n11: Champion of Torm(2): blind fight<br/>\n12: Champion of Torm(3): STR+1, disarm*, {Smite Evil}, (STR=21)<br/>\n13: Champion of Torm(4): improved critical: longsword<br/>\n14: Champion of Torm(5)<br/>\n15: Barbarian(6): improved disarm*<br/>\n16: Barbarian(7): STR+1, (STR=22)<br/>\n17: Barbarian(8)<br/>\n18: Barbarian(9): great fortitude**<br/>\n19: Barbarian(10)<br/>\n20: Barbarian(11): STR+1, (STR=23)<br/>\n21: Barbarian(12): great strength I, (STR=24)<br/>\n22: Barbarian(13)<br/>\n23: Barbarian(14)<br/>\n24: Barbarian(15): STR+1, terrifying rage, (STR=25)<br/>\n25: Champion of Torm(6): epic weapon focus: longsword<br/>\n26: Champion of Torm(7)<br/>\n27: Champion of Torm(8): great strength II, epic weapon specialization: longsword, (STR=26)<br/>\n28: Champion of Torm(9): STR+1, (STR=27)<br/>\n29: Champion of Torm(10): overwhelming critical: longsword**<br/>\n30: Champion of Torm(11): great strength III, (STR=28)<br/>\n31: Champion of Torm(12)<br/>\n32: Champion of Torm(13): STR+1, (STR=29)<br/>\n33: Champion of Torm(14): great strength IV, devastating critical: longsword**, (STR=30)<br/>\n34: Fighter(5)<br/>\n35: Champion of Torm(15)<br/>\n36: Champion of Torm(16): STR+1, great strength V, (STR=32)<br/>\n37: Champion of Torm(17)<br/>\n38: Champion of Torm(18): armor skin<br/>\n39: Fighter(6): great strength VI, epic prowess, (STR=33)<br/>\n40: Barbarian(16): STR+1, (STR=34)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapon Note: Longsword taken for theme-reasons, it being the closest NWN to the \u201cMagic Ring Hilt\u201d Sword made for Beowulf by a Giant in the story, and is a nice, all-around weapon (without giving away any spoilers, also what you want if looking to play through the OC). That said, if you are uninterested in theme-play/longsword, then consider the scimitar for its crit range. <br/>\n<br/>\n*PvM/E\u2014Note: While it is well-known that Beowulf pulled the arm (disarm) off of the evil monster Grendel, mortally wounding him in turn, if looking to PvM/E your Beowulf (since monsters claws cannot be disarmed), then feel free to swap out disarm and impr.disarm for IKD and Expertise instead.<br/>\n<br/>\n**Note--Dev.Crit Note: Prefer a double weapon specialization instead of Dev.Crit? It is also well known that Beowulf\u2019s blows were lethal, quick-killing sea monsters with devastating precision among other things (which NWN connotes Dev.Crit). That said, if not interested in Dev.Crit and/or it\u2019s banned on your world, then why not pick up a second weapon specialization, such as the Heavy Flail (large, 2-handed bludgeon damage). If so, take: WF: Heavy Flail, WS: Heavy Flail and Impr.Crit Heavy Flail (instead of Cleave, Grt. Cleave, Grt.Fort) pre-epics, and EWF: Heavy Flail and EWS: Heavy Flail (instead of OC, DC) in epics, or otherwise select feats of your own choosing. <br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>III.
