      "content": "<div>If you have been following my posts you may have noticed I've been attempting to pound out a combo with Bard song and combat maneuvers. I still wanted comparable AB and saves. So here we are with a Bard 20 CoT 10 RDD 10 split that looks like it has everything. Currently it's a two handed flanker with stealth, though the obvious scimitar/TS + disc was the main version. I raised his dex a little so that a belt of agility + cat's grace would make chain shirt a good pick, lowering the ACP to -2. <br/>\n<br/>\nI haven't been able to fully reproduce the taunt+expertise combo here in EE, but I can say the combat cancel with taunt on the stack works great, no expertise required.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea for this guy is to sneak up to opponents with invisibility or stealth, curse song (doesn't break invis currently), IKD, Taunt cancel, ID/IDK. Lowering your opponent's discipline by 8 and buffing your own attack by 2, not to mention the -11 AC they will suffer, makes for more consistent maneuver attempts. KD immune opponents tend to be so because they lack discipline, so disarm away. <br/>\n<br/>\nBesides your maneuvers you still have 20 levels of bard utility, dev crit, and 44 AB. I hope to tackle both melee and mages alike with this one. The \"safe\" version uses a shield and scimitar and has discipline and spot. I'm open to any ideas you have, I've been struggling with this one for a while. <br/>\n<br/>\nBard(20), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Champion of Torm(10), Human<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nSTR: 16 (36)<br/>\nDEX: 10<br/>\nCON: 14 (16)<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 14 (16)<br/>\nCHA: 14 (16)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Bard(1): Blind Fight, Curse Song<br/>\n02: Bard(2)<br/>\n03: Bard(3): Weapon Proficiency Exotic<br/>\n04: Bard(4): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n05: Bard(5)<br/>\n06: Red Dragon Disciple(1): Weapon Focus: Scythe<br/>\n07: Red Dragon Disciple(2): (STR=19)<br/>\n08: Red Dragon Disciple(3): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n09: Red Dragon Disciple(4): Knockdown, (STR=22)<br/>\n10: Bard(6)<br/>\n11: Champion of Torm(1)<br/>\n12: Champion of Torm(2): STR+1, Disarm, Improved Knockdown, (STR=23)<br/>\n13: Champion of Torm(3): {Smite Evil}<br/>\n14: Champion of Torm(4): Improved Disarm<br/>\n15: Champion of Torm(5): Improved Critical: Scythe<br/>\n16: Champion of Torm(6): STR+1, Power Attack, (STR=24)<br/>\n17: Bard(7)<br/>\n18: Champion of Torm(7): Cleave<br/>\n19: Champion of Torm(8): Great Cleave<br/>\n20: Bard(8): STR+1, (STR=25)<br/>\n21: Red Dragon Disciple(5): Overwhelming Critical: Scythe<br/>\n22: Red Dragon Disciple(6)<br/>\n23: Red Dragon Disciple(7): (CON=16)<br/>\n24: Red Dragon Disciple(8): STR+1, Devastating Critical: Scythe, (STR=26)<br/>\n25: Red Dragon Disciple(9): (INT=16)<br/>\n26: Red Dragon Disciple(10): {Darkvision}, (STR=30), (CHA=16)<br/>\n27: Bard(9): Armor Skin<br/>\n28: Bard(10): STR+1, (STR=31)<br/>\n29: Bard(11)<br/>\n30: Bard(12): Epic Weapon Focus: Scythe<br/>\n31: Bard(13)<br/>\n32: Bard(14): STR+1, (STR=32)<br/>\n33: Bard(15): Great Strength I, (STR=33)<br/>\n34: Bard(16)<br/>\n35: Bard(17)<br/>\n36: Bard(18): STR+1, Great Strength II, (STR=35)<br/>\n37: Bard(19)<br/>\n38: Champion of Torm(9)<br/>\n39: Bard(20): Lasting Inspiration<br/>\n40: Champion of Torm(10): STR+1, Epic Prowess, (STR=36)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHitpoints: 424<br/>\nSkillpoints: 276<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 30/26/28<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +5<br/>\nBAB: 27<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 44 (melee), 28 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 24/29<br/>\nSpell Casting: Bard(6)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHide 42(42), Lore 8(31), Move Silently 42(42), Perform 42(45), Spellcraft 24(27), Spot 6(5), Taunt 42(45), Tumble 40(40), UMD 30(33)</div>"

      "content": "<div>So I combined this build with true strike scroll for my opener. So far a 90% KD/Disarm rate. For 125 gold.<br/>\n<br/>\n50 Buffed AB + 20 from TS + 8 Discipline removed from Curse Song is a devastating 78+1d20 DC discipline check against IKD or a medium weapon disarm. Worst case scenario I am fighting another buffed RDD with super STR and discipline, for a total of 63 disc, I still like my odds especially if they use a scimitar. Obviously someone that has all that and also disc buffing gear is more resistant to the combo but I do have some good damage output and AC reduction options.</div>"
