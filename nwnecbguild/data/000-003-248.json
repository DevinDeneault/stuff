You know that Clerics use Wisdom to cast, I presume, right? A Zen Archer is a Cleric that invests heavily on Wisdom to improve his casting and then takes a feat called Zen Archery, which allows his Ranged Attacks to be modified by Wisdom, instead of Dexterity. That will make him a very efficient caster and simultaneously a really good Ranged Combatant. But they are tricky to play because they are weak in melee, so you need to be good at avoiding it, and since you don't seem to have a lot of experience, I think you'll do better if you play something more \"melee-like\", like a dwarven Battle Cleric. Besided, I can't see a Dwarf being a pussy non-meleer lol. So I built you something different that will better suit your needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cleric(16), Rogue(4), Champion of Torm(10), Dwarf<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 16 (26)<br/>\n DEX: 8<br/>\n CON: 14<br/>\n WIS: 16 (18)<br/>\n INT: 14<br/>\n CHA: 6<br/>\n<br/>\n Dwarf: (Darkvision, Defensive Training vs. Giants, Stonecunning, Hardiness vs. Poison, Hardiness vs. Spells, Offensive Training vs. Goblinoids, Offensive Training vs. Orcs, Skill Affinity: Lore)<br/>\n 01: Cleric(1): Expertise, Domain Travel, Domain\u00a0War<br/>\n 02: Cleric(2)<br/>\n 03: Cleric(3): Blind Fight<br/>\n 04: Cleric(4): WIS+1, (WIS=17)<br/>\n 05: Cleric(5)<br/>\n 06: Cleric(6): Knockdown<br/>\n 07: Cleric(7)<br/>\n 08: Cleric(8): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n 09: Cleric(9): Extend Spell<br/>\n 10: Cleric(10)<br/>\n 11: Cleric(11)<br/>\n 12: Cleric(12): STR+1, Improved Knockdown, (STR=18)<br/>\n 13: Cleric(13)<br/>\n 14: Cleric(14)<br/>\n 15: Cleric(15): Empower Spell<br/>\n 16: Rogue(1): STR+1, (STR=19)<br/>\n 17: Rogue(2): {Evasion}<br/>\n 18: Rogue(3): Weapon Focus: Morning Star, {Uncanny Dodge I}<br/>\n 19: Champion of Torm(1)<br/>\n 20: Champion of Torm(2): STR+1, Improved Critical: Morning Star, (STR=20)<br/>\n 21: Champion of Torm(3): Great Strength I, {Smite Evil}, (STR=21)<br/>\n 22: Champion of Torm(4): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=18)<br/>\n 23: Champion of Torm(5)<br/>\n 24: Champion of Torm(6): STR+1, Great Strength II, Armor Skin, (STR=23)<br/>\n 25: Champion of Torm(7)<br/>\n 26: Champion of Torm(8): Epic Weapon Focus: Morning Star<br/>\n 27: Rogue(4): Great Strength III, (STR=24)<br/>\n 28: Champion of Torm(9): STR+1, (STR=25)<br/>\n 29: Champion of Torm(10): Epic Prowess<br/>\n 30: Cleric(16): Great Strength IV, (STR=26)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 312<br/>\n Skillpoints: 156<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 25/24/20<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9, Poison: +2<br/>\n BAB: 20<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 32 (melee), 20 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 17/28<br/>\n Spell Casting: Cleric(8)<br/>\n Alignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\n Concentration 33(35), Disable Trap 1(3), Heal 10(14), Open Lock 1(0), Spellcraft 33(35), Spot 32(36), Tumble 30(29), UMD 17(15)<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Concentration(4), Spellcraft(4), Save(8),<br/>\n 02: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(10),<br/>\n 03: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(12),<br/>\n 04: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(14),<br/>\n 05: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(16),<br/>\n 06: Spellcraft(1), Save(19),<br/>\n 07: Spellcraft(1), Save(22),<br/>\n 08: Spellcraft(1), Save(25),<br/>\n 09: Spellcraft(1), Save(28),<br/>\n 10: Spellcraft(1), Save(31),<br/>\n 11: Spellcraft(1), Save(34),<br/>\n 12: Spellcraft(1), Save(37),<br/>\n 13: Spellcraft(1), Save(40),<br/>\n 14: Spellcraft(1), Save(43),<br/>\n 15: Spellcraft(1), Save(46),<br/>\n 16: Disable Trap(1), Open Lock(1), Spot(18), Tumble(19), UMD(17),<br/>\n 17: Heal(7), Spot(2), Tumble(1),<br/>\n 18: Heal(2), Spot(1), Tumble(1), Save(6),<br/>\n 19: Spot(1), Save(9),<br/>\n 20: Spot(1), Save(12),<br/>\n 21: Spot(1), Save(15),<br/>\n 22: Spot(1), Save(18),<br/>\n 23: Spot(1), Save(21),<br/>\n 24: Spot(1), Save(24),<br/>\n 25: Spot(1), Save(27),<br/>\n 26: Spot(1), Save(30),<br/>\n 27: Spot(1), Tumble(9), Save(30),<br/>\n 28: Spot(1), Save(33),<br/>\n 29: Spot(1), Save(36),<br/>\n 30: Concentration(25), Spellcraft(15),<br/>\n<br/>\n I would also refer you to the Game Guides section.<br/>\n<br/>\n I have written a couple of guides that you might like to read: \"An Insight into the Cleric Class\" and \"Playing Better - The Importance of Knowledge and Intelligent Decision-making.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n Have fun!</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Cleric 15, then Rogue 3 then CoT 7 all consecutive, then you can take whatever you want in whatever order as long as the first three levels of each class are taken consecutively.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for advice to build, I will also refer you to the Game Guides section. Please read my \"Complete Guide to the Basics of Building\". You see, building characters is like a college degree, it'll literally take years to develop. It's a whole science in itself. Once you read all those guides I referred you to, you'll have a much better understanding of how broad the spectrum is. I would love to help you, but there's nothing I can do short-term except tell you to read the guides and take your time to sink it all in, then start experimenting with your builds. Post them right here for critiquing by the \"elders\" such as myself and Valerfor, but also HipMaestro, Mick Dagger, Empyre65, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n But don't go straight to experimenting before you read the guides. If you don't, you probably won't understand the advice that will be given to you. I would say that there are a few important things that you need to have a grasp of from the Complete Guide in order to be ready to understand our critique to your builds:<br/>\n<br/>\n - BAB Progression (how it works and how it influences a build, the \"rule of 4\")<br/>\n - Skill Dumps (what are skill dumps, which classes are normally taken for skill dumps, at which levels they are taken and why)<br/>\n - Desirable Epic Feats and Requirements (Devastating Critical for a STR toon (if the server hasn't banned it, which many servers have), Epic Dodge for a DEX toon, Epic Spells for casters, Lasting Inspiration for Bards, Terrifying Rage for Barbarians, Epic Weapon Specialization for Fighters (or CoT builds with at least 4 Fighter levels), Automatic Still Spell for armor-wearing spellswords, etc..)<br/>\n - Class Combos and Synergies (Cleric / Monk, Paladin / CoT, Fighter or any Melee class and RDD, Bard and Blackguard, Sorcerer / Paladin, \u00a0Druid / Monk and SO MANY OTHERS!)<br/>\n - Optimizing Spreads and Pre-epic spreads (What is a spread and what is a pre-epic spread? What does it mean to optimize a build and a spread?)<br/>\n - Optimizing the Leveling order (Which class to take first? Which feats to take first? Which Attribute Point to put where in which order?)<br/>\n<br/>\n As you can see, building optimized toons is far from simple, and that's why I love it so much! We plan all the builds ahead of time. Every feat, every attribute point, every skill point and if we know the server very well, we even plan the gear they'll wear!<br/>\n<br/>\n One thing, though, the Links in the guide are not working, and I have tried to edit them, but can't seem to do it. When I click on Edit post, the guide must be so big that only a part of it is displayed, and the part is the one which doesn't contain the links....<br/>\n<br/>\n Have fun! I would like to see you become an Epic Character Builder! Do you have what it takes? Welcome to the big boys club LOL!!<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I know it seems like we're asking for a lot, but it's really not all that much, cuz building is much more complex than that. Most of the specifics will be done for you, but it'd be nice if you knew a little more to use the build we give you as best as you can.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
