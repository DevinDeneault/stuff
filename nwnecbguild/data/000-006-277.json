      "content": "<div>Hail, magaiti!<br/>\n<br/>\nNice to see someone other than me posting a build around here. I actually have a build VERY VERY similar to yours. I chose not to post it because there were other builds that were also very similar in the search engine. You may not be aware of the search engine, so, just in case, let me refer you to it:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/buildsearch/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Character Builders' Search Engine</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you should be careful when you claim your build has a high AB and a high AC. Smiters are NOTORIOUSLY low-AB builds. Mine, which is by no means a high AB build, has 38 base (1 less than yours, same AB on a smite), while ending at 26 CHA (+1 Divine Shield AC, technically 1 less buffed AC than yours cuz of your Armor Skin). Mine also gets Expertise from level 1 (+5 situational AC) and Taunt (up to +6 situational AB), which makes it, in a way, have a higher effective AB AND AC when compared to this build, provided it's able to Taunt them. If you keep Expertise on after Taunting successfully, you'll have +5 AC and the same AB as your build, but will need to waste a round Taunting.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you do to get the extra +1 AB is to give up a lot for it, more than it's worth. Me is good! Me is a smiter! With 8 INT, not only do you talk like that and not have access to Expertise or Taunt (and therefore the Taunt / Expertise combo), but you also don't get Concentration, which makes you not be able to rebuff in combat (that Divine Favor won't last long enough without Extend Spell).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I wouldn't recommend dropping Improved Critical. If you crit on a Smite, the battle is over, and since you invest so many epic feats to become a proficient 3-times-per-day-only-on-evil-foes destroyer, might as well keep a feat that doubles the threat range on your weapon. I also recommend a weapon (which you didn't pick any) with a wide Threat Range, such as Scimitar or Rapier. If you can't find a Keen rapier where you play, probably better to carry a Scimitar around, as it can receive Keen Edge from party members.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, I would take Weapon Focus much sooner and delay Extra Smiting to level 18, since your smites will only be meaningful in late epics. Also, in my build, I dropped Blind Fight for Extend Spell, as I found that this build relies on buffs a lot, because the STR is always sub-par thanks to the CHA investment. It's a 50-50 tweak and I think it should be left there as an option. <br/>\n<br/>\nStill, I wouldn't want you to get me wrong here. It's quite a feat you managed to go over 38 AB in a Great smiter build. I myself couldn't go over that because I didn't want to sacrifice that much in terms of stats and skills for +1 AB (being that Taunt, which SHOULD BE in your high priorities with such a high CHA build) grants +6 AB if successful and is modified by Charisma.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"
