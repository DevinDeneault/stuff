      "content": "<div>Hi! I just wanted some help building a SS properly.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, some SS info. I intend to play PVP, but I can't seem to get a decent AB.\n<ul>\n<li>Wizard Hit Die upgraded to d8</li>\n<li>Wizard AB progression upgraded to 3/4</li>\n<li>They gain Simple and Martial Weapon proficiency</li>\n<li>They gain Light and Medium Armor proficiency</li>\n<li>They gain Uncanny Dodge</li>\n<li>They gain 5% Arcane Spell Failure reduction to Armor</li>\n<li>They gain +15 Discipline at level 28</li>\n<li>If they aren't holding anything in their offhand (shield, bow, two-hander, etc), they gain +1 (Shield) AC per int modifier, capped by wizard level/6+1 to a maximum of 6 at 30\n<ul>\n<li>Monks using a single Kama are denied this bonus for balance purposes</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Gains the ability to Imbue. Upgrade to Greater Imbue at level 21. (Imbue is infusing temporary properties to your weapon.)</li>\n<li>The epic spell, Epic Mage Armor behaves differently in the hands of a spellsword. Instead of granting the usual +5 to all four armor types (Armor, Natural, Deflection, and Dodge), it grants only +4, totaling in a +16 to AC - however, it also grants a bonus to +4 AB while it is active. Note that EMA does not stack with the regular Mage Armor in any way.</li>\n</ul>\nSpellswords gain the ability to use Medium armor.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nDrow starting abilities: 2 Dex, 2 Int, 2 Cha, -2 Con. Can take a gift to remove the +2 Cha and give +2 Con after character is made.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Specialist gives you access to all skills in the game, as well as granting a feat every 3 levels. Can only be taken in Epic levels and requires Skill focus feat)<br/>\n16 (22) Str\u00a0<br/>\n14 Dex<br/>\n12+2 Con<br/>\n18 (19) Int<br/>\n8 Wis and Cha<br/>\n<br/>\n1 Spellsword: Expertise<br/>\n2 Spellsword:<br/>\n3 Spellsword: Weapon Focus<br/>\n4 Spellsword:<br/>\n5 Spellsword: Extend spell<br/>\n6 Spellsword: Improved expertise<br/>\n7 Spellsword:<br/>\n8 Spellsword:<br/>\n9 Spellsword: Maximise Spell<br/>\n10 Spellsword: SF: Transmutation<br/>\n11 Spellsword:\u00a0<br/>\n12 Spellsword: GSF: Transmutation<br/>\n13 Spellsword:<br/>\n14 Spellsword:<br/>\n15 Spellsword: Blind fight; SF: Abjuration<br/>\n16 Spellsword: +1INT<br/>\n17 Spellsword:<br/>\n18 Spellsword: Imp.

From what I've heard it's possible to end up with around 50 BaB and over 60 AC after buffs, but I can't seem to get BaB higher than 45isch and AC around 50. I went with ESF: UMD to get UMD to 40 so I could use Second skin, which gives 3 STR; 3 CON and 3 Dex.</div>"

      "content": "<div>I don't play on Arelith so some of what I write below might be wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour level progression is slightly wrong, you write 22-24 as Specialist but based on your feats those are actually Spellsword levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to the wiki, the AB bonus (including the BAB increase) is soft and counts towards the +20 cap. [<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Spellsword\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://wiki.arelith.com/Spellsword</a>]<br/>\nWith +12 STR and at the AB cap, your AB is limited to 15 (BAB) + 12 (STR) + 4 (Feats) + 20 (AB Bonus) = +51<br/>\nCurrently you get +5 AB from the BAB increase, +5 AB from GMW (unless +6 weapons are available), and +4 AB from EMA, so you're 6 AB from the cap.<br/>\n<br/>\nBelow is your current AC with +1 INT, chainmail, and +3 AC boots. The max AC version uses full plate armor, a +3 tower shield, and +3 AC boots.<br/>\nCurrent AC: 10 (Base) + 2 (DEX) + 6 (Tumble) + 2 (Feats) + 5 (Armor) + 3 (AC Bonus) + 5 (Shield Bonus) + 5 (Shield) + 5 (Shadow Shield) + 8 (EMA) + 4 (Haste) = 55<br/>\nMax AC: 10 (Base) + 1 (DEX) + 6 (Tumble) + 2 (Feats) + 8 (Armor) + 3 (Shield) + 6 (AC Bonus) + 5 (Shield) + 5 (Shadow Shield) + 8 (EMA) + 4 (Haste) = 58<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently you're at +45AB/55AC, but you can potentially reach +51AB/57AC. It is possible to get 6 AB from divine spells but when cast from wands or scrolls their duration is pretty low. You can improve your AC to 57 by getting +12 DEX and wearing padded armor. It might be possible to improve that even further, but that's the best I can do with the items and spell changes that I'm aware of.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Although I have played Arelith for several years, I have never played a Spellsword.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, I would recommend checking out the Arelith build-dump and more importantly the build mechanics channel on either/both the unofficial (established but a little salty) Arelith Discord or the official (new) Arelith Discord.  You will get far better advice there than here.  There is vast knowledge here, but Arelith is so customised both in across the class mechanics and the world mechanics making it difficult for builders to understand and plan for the nuances.  Most of the \u201cArelith\u201d builds recommended here perform poorly on the server as a result.  They are however, pretty solid build for a less customised server :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSpecialist is a rather new addition but you can replace the bard portion of the following build with specialist if you wish.  This is a recommended spellsword build from the unofficial Arelith Discord and was built prior to the changes that added specialist and heavily customised Discipline making it a little less \u201crequired\u201d.  If you do go specialist, you will need to use your free feat to add a skill focus to meet the requirement for specialist.  As a Drow, you will lose a pre-epic feat, I suggest Greater Abjuration and then spend your \u201cSpecialist\u201d feat on either Lore or Discipline and drop Greater Abjuration into your epic feats.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHigh CL Spellsword Build, has a bit less raw physical damage but more able to resist dispells/imbue DCs.

I believe they are all pre-BigChange as well, so you can swap the bard dips for specialist.  Two of them should be more solid melee AB builds but at the cost of increasing the dispelability of the spellsword, no umd but lore is a solid alternative with the latest changes.  Arelith has modified Dispels negating the 24 level general caster Goto.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>"

I assume that\u00a0Daedknox's build is based on that one but edited to account for the race and class differences. Your version has +1 AB thanks to the STR gift, but I don't think that is available for drow so ultimately it doesn't really improve on the original build.</div>"

      "content": "<div>To clarify, you are correct Yunim. 22-24 was not meant to be Specialist levels but where left-overs from a previous draft of the same build. I edited it so it should now say Spellsword. And thanks for the gearing tips! It's something I've thought a lot about was unsure how what to go for! Shield is impossible with the build I've posted above as it doesn't get the proficiency for them. I haven't consider divine wands before, but I'm def considering them now. Thanks for info!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd thanks Zanithar. But as Yunim suggested that is the build I based this build on, and losing CL for AB doesn't really appeal to me. I did try out his other builds on the PGCC but, yeah. I liked the one with more CL better. Thanks though!\u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>Fair enough, then your only gain would be at a trade off of AC.  You can gain +2 AB by using a twohanded weapon over a one handed weapon.  This will cost you 3 AC (If you use a shield sheen), or 4 AC if you do not use a shield Skeen.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>"
