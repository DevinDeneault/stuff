      "content": "<div>Hi,<br/>\n<br/>\nI am one of those strange people who like to roleplay in games like NWN, but at the same time I still want to be powerful. So what that means in my case: When I start a new character, I set some requirements and restrictions for my build, but inside that self-imposed ruleset I try to maximize the power of the build. Now the thing is, I am mainly a Baldur's Gate player and only play NWN occasionally. So I am really not good at making NWN builds. This is why I am requesting help of the talented builders in this forum.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my next playthrough I want to play a Human Bounty Hunter. This is a character I played in multiple incarnations in Baldurs Gate. Most of the time he is some mixture of (kitted) Fighter/Rogue dual class, but I also played him as Ranger and Barbarian (in Baldur's Gate that is). Here are the restrictions:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) pure PvM<br/>\n2) using the same character for OC/SoU/HotU and some other modules, so I will eventually reach level 40. However, most the time will be spent below that level, so the build should be working ideally from level 1<br/>\n3) Race: Human<br/>\n4) Class preference: Must include Rogue, ideally I want to be able to disarm most or all traps in the game and open all locks. The second class should be something Fighter-like with good BAB. Third class (if applicable) can be anything, but should fit to the theme of a mercenary/bounty hunter.<br/>\n5) Melee preference: I want this character to be a proficient melee fighter (STR based). One of the main goals is to maximize his melee damage (within the framework of this build)<br/>\n6) Range preference: It should not be a primary ranged character, but it would be nice if he could switch to a crossbow should the situation call for it<br/>\n7) Weapon preference: one-handed axe should be the main weapon (I don't care if dual wielding, using a shield or just leaving the left hand empty)<br/>\n8) Maximum item enhancement: As I said, I will be playing the official campaigns and some premium modules<br/>\n9) Spellcasting: The build should not include any pure spellcasting class (something like Ranger is fine though)<br/>\n10) Custom factors: Basically I am trying to capture the spirit of a typical Bounty Hunter / Mercenary here. Alignment will probably something with neutral (maybe even evil?). The character will ask for a reward every time that option is present. He works for money and almost accepts any task as long as the price is right. When he goes on a mission, he is well prepared. Tasked to capture a target person alive? He will bring a net, ropes and maybe paralyzing poison. Tasked wiping out a group of trolls? Will bring fire bolts and acid vials. Tasking killing a werewolf? Will bring a silver weapon, etc. Think Geralt of Rivia but more cruel and greedy. <br/>\nThe bounty hunter usually works alone as he is not keen on splitting the rewards. So he tries to be fairly self-supporting i.e. don't rely on a cleric, but instead bring healing potions and maybe some heal kits.<br/>\nIt would be cool if the character is not only proficient at disarming but also at settings traps.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading this far! If I don't get any replies here, what I will do is basically just picking alternate Rogue/Fighter levels and see where this leads me. I am sure some of you can come up with much better builds, so any replies (be it just hints or even full builds) are highly appreciated.</div>"

You will have numerous other choices for the third class.<br/>\nThe main weakness of the Rogue/Fighter combination is the saves tend to be weak, feats to boost these are a good idea.<br/>\nIf you are looking at a Str Rogue/Fighter I'm sure you have a lot of choices<br/>\nThe ECB Archives can be searched <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/buildsearch/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a><br/>\nThere is a search engine for newer builds <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/other/tool/ecb-guild-build-archive-v2\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a><br/>\n<br/>\nFor a str based rogue for the environment you want to play in, I'm quite happy to suggest my Blackguard Executioner build <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/blackguard-executioner-rogue-17-assassin-1-blackgu-t2355175-s10.html#p17150\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br/>\nI've playtested this to level 38 and it should do well in most low to mid magic environments.<br/>\nIt has excellent AB, +13d6 sneak attack +6 damage from EWS and 30 str/dev crit, heaps of fun stuff, plus 300+ skill points for rogue stuff, around 450hp.<br/>\nI'll have been meaning to finalise this build for some time and I'll work on getting that done tonight, there are just some small adjustments after playtesting + getting a bit wiser than I was when I designed it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Edit:\u00a0</strong>I have finalized <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-blackguard-executioner-rogue-13-fighter-8-blac-t2355175.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the build</a>\u00a0for consideration for inclusion in the level 40 section, with thanks.\u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>I have some more ideas for this:<br/>\n<br/>\nA Rogue 19 / Fighter 14 / Weapon Master 7 would take advantage of the x3 critical hits from that battleaxe, but some enemies will be immune to critical hits, and therefore to sneak attacks, too.\u00a0 That is where the high strength and Weapon Spec./Epic Weapon Spec. come in, to do decent damage anyway.\u00a0 By the way, if you used a warhammer instead, it would do the seldom-resisted blunt damage instead of slashing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never been impressed with the Assassin class, especially now that the Death Attack has been nerfed, but some people love it and it would certainly fit the theme of this bounty hunter.\u00a0 Maybe somebody could develop the idea for you if you like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother idea would be to make a Rogue 24 / Fighter 16 with no third class to \"dilute\" it.</div>",

So I may look into the mods you suggested.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way for anyone interested: I decided to go with a slightly modified version of Shock and Awe: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build253541.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/buil ... 53541.html</a><br/>\nBasically I focused on Battleaxes instead of Greatsword. Right now I am in the middle of the OC and feeling quite strong :)</div>"

      "content": "<div>Thanks demilich for linking GDL's build, I was curious what build you decided on because you had so many great choices, and GDL's build is a great build.<br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>demilich wrote:</strong><br/>\nI just wanted some way to reach level 40.

If you do Aielund, don't go dev crit as it is disabled. Blackguard Bull's Strength seemed to not work for some reason when I played it some 12 months ago (might have been fixed if it has been updated?)</div>"
