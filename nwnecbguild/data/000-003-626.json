      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hello everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nI recently returned to nwn (ee) and only just joined your great forum today! :)\u00a0<br/>\nSince I returned I decided to try out some of all the great SP content that has been created. I first tried the Aielund Saga and loved it!\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\nI am currently going through Swordflight chapter IV with Valerfors Andariel build and I am shocked to see that even with a build as tough as the Bard/RDD/PM the module is still very challenging - awesome!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that my chronic restartitis is starting to show itself and I have always had a weakness for caster builds.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you have any tips or ideas of builds for me to get inspired by when building a caster for Swordflight? It is heavily restricted in terms of resting and it seems there have been made some spell changes although i dont know which ( I just know that the creature i summoned from a \"gate\" scroll was vastly improved and absolutely wrecked house).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been looking at various builds and it seems like casters are typically segmented into DC casters, EDR casters and other multiclass-type casters (correct me if I am wrong). I dont have a priority on any of this currently other than i want it to be a real caster and not watered down version that can also do other things such as healing or fighting. I am also leaning towards wizard rather than sorc as it will allow me to try out more spells and see if they have changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I posted in the wrong forum or have somehow broken the rules I apologize in advance! :)<br/>\n<br/>\ncheers.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Just as a little addendum: are you looking for help with a caster up to the end of Part 4, or one that takes you all the way to level 40? My understanding is that Part 1 covers (all these will be rough guides) levels 1-5, Part 2 levels to 17, Part 3 up to level 25, and Part 4 level 33. I know Rogueknight's intention is for 6 modules in total, giving plenty of level 40 playtime in the final one (at least, that's what he's said before). Thus a level 40 build is grand, but you might need some patience before the final 2 Parts are released. Or would you prefer one that's as good as possible (within reason) up to level 33?<br/>\n<br/>\n(Someone will actually answer your question soon, I'm sure\u00a0 <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" />)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">If the module has heavy rest restrictions I suggest focusing on damage shields, that way you can save your spells for ranged mobs, casters, and tough bosses. Since you can't reach level 40 I would advise against picking PM, 10 levels is a big sacrifice to make for PM immunities. An almost pure Wizard, such as a Rog3/Wiz29/Rang1 or Monk3/Wiz29/Rang1, should work well. A gnome with 18CON/18INT makes for a decent starting point regardless of what class spread you end up going with.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

By damage shields, do you mean stone skin + acid sheath stuff?<br/>\n<br/>\nI did notice a few builds that focused on EDR and various protections to simply let your enemies kill themselves by attacking you, but is it possible or even a good idea to make such a build for a lvl 33 cap?<br/>\nOr is it better to focus on epic spells and spell dc?<br/>\n<br/>\nYour feedback is appreciated <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Death Armor + Elemental Shield + Mestil's Acid Sheath, combined with Premonition / Epic Warding, Energy Buffer, and Shapechange: Iron Golem is a very useful (and OP) tactic for mages. You can use damage shields without EDR3, but I've never played\u00a0Swordflight so I don't know if there are enough defensive and healing items to make it viable. Even if you do go for EDR3 you can still get decent DC scores, they will just be 3 or 4 points below a dedicated DC caster.<br/>\n<br/>\nA Wiz29/Monk2/Figh2 can get 11 epic feats, which is enough for EDR3, ESF:Concentration, Epic Warding, and some DC boosting feats. Assuming an 18CON/18INT gnome start, it can end up with 22CON/26INT and 2 Epic Spell Focuses.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn comparison a minmaxed DC mage such as a Wiz30/CoT2/Rang1 can also get 11 epic feats, enough for Epic Warding and DC boosting feats. With an 18 INT start it can end up with 34 INT and 2 Epic Spell Focuses. In some environments that 4 DC difference can be significant but I don't know if that's the case for\u00a0Swordflight.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth builds can (ab)use damage shields, DC spells, and no-save spells such as Ice Storm, IGMS, or the Bigby's line.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">For the Wiz29/Monk2/Figh2 I'd go with: 1-17: Wiz. 18: Monk. 19-20: Wiz. 21-22: Figh. 23-26: Wiz. 27: Monk. 28-33: Wiz.<br/>\nThe pre-epic spread has to be Wiz19/Monk1, and I like to get level 9 spells as soon as possible hence leaving the first Monk level to level 18. Taking Fighter straight away lets the build get EDR3 by level 22, and the final Monk level at 27 is for a skill dump.<br/>\nIf you choose to extend the build to level 40 it should end up as a Wiz35/Monk3/Figh2, with the final Monk level at level 37. As an 18CON/18INT gnome this will result in a smooth levelling build with no XP penalty that peaks fairly early.<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually choose generalist unless I already have mage experience in that particular environment. If I do pick a specialist school I usually go for illusion, but I've played on plenty of servers where enchantment spells are useful so that's not the universally best school to focus in.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Both Wiz35/Monk3/Figh2 and Wiz35/Rog3/Figh2 will be fairly strong builds, although if you do go for Rogue then I suggest delaying the Rogue levels to 28/38 instead of 27/37 for an extra point in UMD.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
