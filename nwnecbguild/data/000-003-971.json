      "content": "<div>This might be stupid, because I've never built a Pally so I don't know its sensible cut-off points, but one thought might be getting 12 levels of Monk, with at least 6 pre-epic (so you get free Knockdown and IKD). 9 levels also gives you free Improved Evasion, and 12 gives undispellable spell resistance of 10+class level). You'd also have +40% speed (in robes) and +2AC (at level 10). You could always swap to the romantically named \"fister\" against the undead, if you so choose.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, avoiding the xp penalty, you might consider sacrificing WS and EWS and going for 10 levels of CoT, which also has a nice synergy with Paladin anyway. It also attracts bonus feats every other level, like Fighter, so you wouldn't be feat-starved, and your saves would also be improved. This would leave you 18 levels of Pally.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the feats themselves: I would think you'd also want at least Blind Fight and Improved Critical pre-epic, with Armor Skin and Epic Prowess in epic levels. I don't know whether Lord of Terror allows Devastating Critical or not (I know SoF does), but if so, that might be a path worth exploring. If not, dual-wielding those kamas might work.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike I said, though, I could be spouting absolute bollocks here...</div>",

Forgive me when I still would like to have more opinions.<br/>\n(Should I end up using an already existing build, because nothing too different would work, so be it. My main purpose is learning. Should I, with your help, be able to play a new, unique build, that would be a great bonus, though.

What does strike me is that Expertise would be a nigh-essential feat to take, and Taunt (and probably Concentration) would be good skills. Another possibility might be to go for only a few levels of pally and lots more monkishness, but that's probably because Monk is my absolute favourite class.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou do right to await input from others, btw, because I could unintentionally be leading you down a blind alley here.

      "content": "<div>Worry not, my friend, I was merely having a (very) little fun. Believe me, like my head, my skin is thick!<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously, though, CoT is a great class (unless you're planning on being evil, which is not allowed). It's a full BAB fighter-type class, with few prerequisites. You need to have a BAB of +7, be non-evil, and have a weapon focus in a melee weapon (and Unarmed doesn't count). It receives a bonus feat every other level (like Fighter does) and has Fortitude and Reflex as primary saves. You will also get +1 to all 3 basic saves (Sacred Defense) on every other level (2, 4, 6, etc). And then there's Divine Wrath, which is CHA-based, and means for every 5 levels (starting at level 5) attack and damage and save bonuses increase by a further +2 (selected, short-term). CoT levels also stack with Pally levels for Smiting purposes (the only class that does). The only downside as opposed to Fighter is the lack of WS/EWS - although if you were to take it with Fighter up to level 4 (the first time you can get WS), you can take EWS as a CoT level. Oh, and you get Lay on Hands at level 1, and can take Great Smite and Great Wisdom in epic levels as bonus feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps - though you might get more from the wiki.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

      "content": "<div>Hey man! <br/>\n<br/>\nLet me give you some advice in the form of questions. I know you've read my guide to the basics of building, so I'll use it as reference to guide your thinking process: <br/>\n<br/>\n1- what is your character concept?<br/>\n2- what do you want from each class? What is Paladin doing in the build? What is Fighter doing in the build? What is Monk doing in the build?<br/>\n<br/>\nI already see a conceptual problem here. CoT and Fighter would, although appearing to be similar, complement the build in VERY DIFFERENT ways. Fighter would grant you more damage with EWS and one more feat than CoT, but would incur an XP penalty, which is a HUGE deal in finite XP settings (AKA non-PW play). CoT, on the other hand, would grant you a boost to saves and possibly extra Great Smite feats, if you decide to go down that road. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs I mentioned, you need to decide what each class is bringing to the build. You CAN'T use Kamas and get the Monk attack progression unless in Robes and no shield, and STR builds don't go well with robes. So, if you're taking Monk to wield Kamas, then DEX is the way to go. However, if Monk is there just for the feats and Evasion, then you really don't need that many levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Pally is there for the buffs, then indispellability is desirable, and that's attained with 24 levels in the class. However, if it's there just for immunities and DM/DS, you don't need more than 4 levels of it. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want damage, then Fighter is the way to go for the 3rd class. If you want better saves and access to some of the divine feats, then CoT is better for that purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me end this message by suggesting a few different spreads for you to toy with:<br/>\n<br/>\nPally 26 Monk 6 CoT 8 - full pally spellbook, indispellable, bonus feats from CoT and Monk. If made a STR build, better not to go for Kamas.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk 20 / Paladin 4 / Fighter 16<br/>\n<br/>\nCould attack unarmed or with Kamas (Unarmed would likely do more damage) and be focused on DEX / CHA. You can trash Wisdom, and go Fighter 8 / Monk 8 / Pal 4. <br/>\n<br/>\nPal 17 / Monk 9 / CoT 14 <br/>\n<br/>\nThis guy would have better saves, and 4 pally spell levels, but would be easily dispellable and Monk would only give Improved Evasion. This could be tricky, stat-wise, but that's the challenge with pallies anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you could read my guide on Paladins, to get a better understanding of the class and the diverse ways to use it in a build.<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn't say it was going to be easy, but it's doable, with some thinking involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!</div>",

Unfortunately, that means you won't be getting the free Knockdown twins until then. That was what first got me thinking about bumping up the levels of Monk and taking the first 6 pre-epic. Of course, you could take KD (and Imp KD, for that matter, but you'd need to ensure you have an INT of 13+, which you don't need for the Monk version) as a feat in its own right, but in that case you really don't need the 6 levels at all, and 3 or 4 would give you all the cheese you need.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're aiming for perfection at level 40, then all is well and good, but if you want playability throughout, it might be an issue.

      "content": "<div>FG. If I may suggest something, have a look at the guide FIRST. That'll help you understand the main class of the build. Then, SECOND, have a look at a few existing builds and try to figure out the whys of each one. Why did he/she take so many/so few levels of the class. What synergies are there within the class combo?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll exemplify here: what are the synergies between CoT and Paladin?<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladin has Divine Grace, adding CHA to saves, CoT gives save bonuses and even Monk synergizes here, having 3 strong saves.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaladins who get Divine Shield and Might will be tight on feats, and CoT gives bonus feats to make up for that. <br/>\n<br/>\nMonk and Pally also have some nice synergies. Pally casts from Wisdom, Monk uses Wisdom to add to AC and for Stunning Fists. Monk attack progression with Kamas and Pally buffs / Divine damage makes up for a REALLY HIGH DPR (Damage Per Round). But that only works on robes with no shield.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you should try to get some kind of reasoning going before you sit down to make your own build. Once you understand the classes, then you can go back to the guide for the Basics to optimize the build.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do have to say that Empyre and I are very different builders in style. He builds for playability, whereas I go for POWER! I have NEVER not been able to level any build, but I am a very experienced player, and I've been playing on World of Greyhawk (WoG), which is one of the most if not the most challenging environment out there, for over 10 years. My builds will generally be stronger, but harder to play. Empyre's builds will have a lot more playability, but be weaker at 40. Also, he builds for Single Player modules, which I never play. I build for PWs, where XP is infinite, and there's a big difference when you build for these settings. XP penalty is nothing more than a nuisance in PWs, but for Single Player modules, it can be a huge deal!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd also refer you to my \"Playing Better\" guide. Where I discuss in-game things that'll make you a better player. <br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>",

Would be really helpful indeed! Probably much easier than pen, paper and the Halls of Advanced Training.<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting build you have. Not what I had in mind (wanted Monk mostly for Evasion, gear, a few more skill points and a few points in Tumble and Listen), but might try it just for fun. A dual-wielding Pally, not what you see everyday. I like the idea.<br/>\nMight I ask why you don't start with Monk? Would give 8 more skill points. Does it make any difference I am not aware of? Couldn't a first level Monk take the same feats?<br/>\nMisread something in the wiki, by the way, which is why I got the idea of using a kama. Already wondered why the Monk extra attack still should work in full plate and with a tower shield, but yeah... in that case, it would have been really worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\n@Maximilian Kane: Already read your guide about how to play better and had a look at the Pally guide.<br/>\nI want to build better characters for single player modules mostly. They should be playable. So that I have a chance in hardcore and more fun. Not always at all levels (sometimes the first 2 or 3 or 15 can be ignored), but definitely long before level 40. Super powerful level 40 characters are nice, but skill dumps at level 37 don't help me much when I could need the skills (or extra feats) at levels 3-8 or so.<br/>\nWhen I take something like this here: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/divine-generalist-rogue-5-paladin-7-champion-of-to-t2343426.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">divine-generalist-rogue-5-paladin-7-cha ... 43426.html</a> and go a bit into the direction you suggested in your comment to this build, this will be relatively close to what I had in mind at the beginning.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou guys are all so great!</div>"

Sadly, very few have read your \"Building Style x In-game Decisions\" thread in the General Discussions sub-forum. I have, and others should. I'm only sorry I haven't got back to you again on it). I'm sure you would be the first to acknowledge - going back to your Aielund days - that things are very different in modules from how they are in PWs, and we're currently looking at SP modules.<br/>\n<br/>\n@ Empyre: oh, that's clever, I like it - suitable hat-doffing, sir - just a shame we can't squeeze Listen or Spot in there. But I'm interested in why you went for kama rather than unarmed in a STR-build? I know the number of attacks increases because of the D-W, but you could swap that for a Dev Crit unarmed build (recognising you'd need a WF in a melee weapon for CoT). Should be do-able when you lose 3 feats (2 with that WF) and take Great Cleave, which then actually gives you one more feat for something else. Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi!<br/>\n<br/>\n@ Freaky Grandma (btw, what can we call you for short? Freaky? Grandma? Strange childhood remembrances?) Ah, so you did only want Monk for the cheese, and Pally was your main goal. That's fair enough. Given Valeror's assertion that you won't have to commit to combat until after you hit level 3, Monk at level 1 shouldn't be a problem, except (iirc) you can't take Power Attack until you have a BAB of 1, which you wouldn't have, so you'd be doing some trading-off.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is all good, innit? I know I'm enjoying it - and look, all the great and good (apart from Mick, who apparently is on a dodo hunt) are involved - and me, too! Good call Freaky Grandma!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Bloody hell, Mick's here too, now! And, true to form, he's ninja'd me.</div>",

You are also capable of casting the full repertoire of Paladin's incantations that are amongst the most potent in the game, giving you the ability to raise your total attack bonus by a significant degree, chief amongst them being \"Divine Favour\" a short (10 rounds duration) spell that raises both your attack and damage. That is why this build has \"Extend Spell\" amongst its feats so that you can populate your second level slots with extended versions of that spell. At lower levels pay attention to another 1st level spell that you have, \"Bless Weapon\" will simply annihilate undead struck by your sword. You also have a total of (14) uses of \"Turn Undead\" that can be used for Divine Shield and Might.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis build is front-loaded in order to get the most important feats early, but extended it to the full forty levels is something simple, should you want it.</div>"

For those that don't know about the original version, the theme is about a non-charismatic version of the classic paladin\u00a0 that uses brute force &amp; early dev critical for offense and his spells for defense (deathward, freedom of movement, protection from evil, etc). If you like more defense you could always take a tower shield &amp; scimitar/ longsword setup. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis build's AB is so high that makes even weapon-masters weep (for reference my \"Arelith Swordmaster\" which is pretty optimized as a build, achieves a natural 40 AB by level 30) because it has a natural 37 AB which gets augmented by your awesome Paladin buffs by (8) more, then Taunt can rise it even higher by another (6), if you care to do that. And that's the \"nice\" Human version with plenty of skill points and an extra feat because the Half-Orc version (the original Puissant Paladin was a Half-Orc) gets both +1 AB and takes Dev Critical earlier, on his 23rd level. I could optimize this even more tbh but I wanted to show a yardstick build for level 30 and not the absolute maximum that it can achieve (which is not needed).<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Puissant Paladin</strong><br/>\n(Paladin 30)<br/>\n<br/>\nRACE: Human<br/>\nALIGNMENT: Lawful Good<br/>\nPLAYABILITY: PvM 1-40 level<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>STARTING/</strong><strong>ENDING</strong><strong> STATS:</strong><br/>\nSTR -\u00a0 18 (<strong>26</strong>)<br/>\nDEX -\u00a0 08<br/>\nCON - 10<br/>\nINT -\u00a0\u00a0 14<br/>\nWIS -\u00a0 14<br/>\nCHA - 08<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Hit Points</strong>: 300<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Skill Points</strong>: 165<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscipline: 33 (41)<br/>\nHeal: 13 (15)<br/>\nPersuade: 33 (32)<br/>\nSpellcraft: 13 (15) cc<br/>\nTaunt: 33 (46)<br/>\nTumble: 15 (14) cc<br/>\n<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fort/Ref/Will): 17/ 10/ 13 (+3 Vs Spells)<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fort/Ref/Will): 22/ 15/ 18 (Buffed Charisma)<br/>\n<br/>\nNaked AC: 14/ 22 (Full Plate Armour)<br/>\n<br/>\nBAB: 30 (Four Attacks)<br/>\nAB: +37/ +32/ +27/ +22 (Greatsword)<br/>\nDMG: 2d6 +12 / 17-20 x2 (Greatsword)<br/>\n<br/>\nDevastating Critical DC: 33 (39)<br/>\nSpellcasting: Paladin 4<sup>th</sup> Circle Of Spells (Undispellable)<br/>\nImmunity to Fear &amp; Disease<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>LEVELING GUIDE:</strong><br/>\n01) Paladin (01): Power Attack, Cleave<br/>\n02) Paladin (02):<br/>\n03) Paladin (03): Expertise<br/>\n04) Paladin (04): {STR +1}<br/>\n05) Paladin (05): <br/>\n06) Paladin (06): Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br/>\n07) Paladin (07): <br/>\n08) Paladin (08): {STR +1}<br/>\n09) Paladin (09): Improved Critical: Greatsword<br/>\n10) Paladin (10): <br/>\n11) Paladin (11): <br/>\n12) Paladin (12): Knockdown, {STR +1}<br/>\n13) Paladin (13): <br/>\n14) Paladin (14): <br/>\n15) Paladin (15): Blind Fighting<br/>\n16) Paladin (16): {STR +1}<br/>\n17) Paladin (17): <br/>\n18) Paladin (18): Great Cleave<br/>\n19) Paladin (19): <br/>\n20) Paladin (20): {STR +1}<br/>\n21) Paladin (21): Great Strength I<br/>\n22) Paladin (22): <br/>\n23) Paladin (23): Overwhelming Critical: Greatsword<br/>\n24) Paladin (24): Devastating Critical: Greatsword, {STR +1}<br/>\n25) Paladin (25): <br/>\n26) Paladin (26): Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br/>\n27) Paladin (27): Armour Skin<br/>\n28) Paladin (28): {STR +1}<br/>\n29) Paladin (29): Epic Prowess<br/>\n30) Paladin (30): Epic Skill Focus: Taunt</div>"

I wouldn't even know what character type to play...\n</div></blockquote>\nFair enough - although all sorts of characters will work (can't vouch for casters, I'm afraid) there. I've been a stealthy halfling, an AA, a DwD, a raging Barbarian, a dwarven archer, a Ranger, oh, and lots of Monks - including my first evil character, Mick's Kama Shinobi. If you haven't already, have a flick through the Aielund thread in the Modules forum - spoilers have been kept to a minimum.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you fancy trying the build you've taken through LoT in a different environment, you could go through the OC and then Aribeth's Redemption (the character has to be Good; Human, Half-Elf or Elf; and male - so iirc you'd have to swap gender). I started a thread about it, again in the Modules forum. That should get you up to level 28-ish, so ideal for SoF.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and thanks for the offer, Valerfor, but a tot or two of the Macallan did the trick for the cough!</div>",
