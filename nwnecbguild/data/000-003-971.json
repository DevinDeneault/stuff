      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">I have been looking through out the forums for a build but the more I read the more confused I get (kinda). I was focusing on these 4 builds:<br/>\n<br/>\nDivine Warrior: Christian \"Torias\" Gillott.<br/>\nSilver Flame of Andor: Valerfor<br/>\nHoly Weapon Master With Cheese: Maximillian Kane<br/>\nDwarven Wall: Severin \"o0ophrostbyteo0o\" Fjelstad<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I know 3 have Paladin in common but it is not required as I have come to see that Paladin is actually offensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what I am looking for is a build that may take longer to kill the enemy but will survive most encounters or go the longest without a rest.<br/>\nI will be playing Original, SoU, HotU and Kingmaker. I expect that by the time I do any modules I will have a grasp on what is going on.<br/>\n<br/>\nPvM<br/>\nLevel cap 30 ish<br/>\nMelee focused<br/>\nHuman unless Dwarven Defender is that good<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your time and if there is a build that fits this please point me in it's direction.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I can relate to the confusion. Before I can build an effective character, I have a lot to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, for the OC or SoU and HotU you do not need a build like you describe it. There are no rest restrictions. (In Kingmaker, after the intro, you will start from level 1 again anyway.)<br/>\nOr do you wish to combine the OC, SoU and HotU with modules? Like Aribeth\"s Redemption or Mines of Twin Summits after the OC and something like Sand of Fate after HotU?<br/>\nA good build never can hurt, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the builds here have been optimized for a special surrounding, something that is much harder than the OC.<br/>\nSilver Flame of Andor, as an example, is optimized for fighting loads of undead, demons and other evil creatures.<br/>\nMaximilian Kane's builds are for a very challenging server and build for maximum power at level 40. You won't see their full potential when you just play the OC or SoU and HotU.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking forward to what others will say to it, maybe there is something to learn for me...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hello Jordus, and welcome!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm afraid there's no simple answer to this one - so much of it depends on how you like to play. The two basic types of defensive build focus very differently. The first is to not get hit. Sounds obvious, but there are many ways of doing this, through agility (high DEX, speed, evasion and dodging), not being seen (stealth, invisibility), and not being there (trapping, ranged attacks, using a tank to keep you from harm). They're the three that come immediately to mind, and all can be enhanced by buffs and magic, and, indeed, all work well together, but I'm sure there are others.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second way is to recognise that you will get hit and compensate for it, through high CON, immunity to being flanked (rendering sneak attacks useless), resistances and reducing any damage that you take. Again, there are many ways of achieving this: innate abilities, mundane means and magical augmentation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaving throws should also not be neglected. You can be strong as an ox and be wearing all the plate metal of a battle cruiser, but if you get confused, afraid, stunned, or just knocked on your backside, it's game over.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, there is another school of thought that says the quicker you kill the baddies the less chance you've got of being killed yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be lovely to have all of this rolled into one, but alas, it's impossible. Thus, returning to my first point, it all hangs on how you want to play. There would be no point recommending a sneaky, back-stabbing, trapper, when what you want is to stand on the bridge hollering \"You shall not pass!\". So I'm afraid I'm batting it back to you, sorry!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

As for the OC, you don't need to focus in defense unless you are doing a no-reload run (pretty common in Baldur's Gate etc) but in a good offense rather and instead make clever use of the items the module offers. Here, let me help you by showing what another player did here with just a plain Barbarian and with several limitations in place in his OC run last time, you can see both his build and his items in that thread. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/original-campaign-2002-revisited-t2354660-s30.html#p11276\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">original-campaign-2002-revisited-t23546 ... tml#p11276</a><br/>\n<br/>\nFor anything else regarding the official modules, Stagmeister is the de facto authority here since he has played them more times than anyone else.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, instead of kingmaker try to find \"Wyvern Crown of Cormyr\" if you can, it was the best premium module that Bioware released back then along with \"Darkness over Daggerford.\" Bah, let me find them for ya, won't take long...

As a side not I could not find an updated Divine Warrior.

A few examples: Discipline is modified by Strength; Tumble by Dexterity; Listen and Spot by Wisdom; Spellcraft by Intelligence. So the Discipline 33 (44) means that the +11 Strength stat gets added to the 33 inputted points in the skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, some skills are restricted by class, and you might not be able to take them at all, or, you might but they will \"cost\" you twice as much. For example a pure Fighter will not be able to acquire more than 20 points in Tumble, though it will still cost them 40 points (technically, they could get 21, but there would be no real point to that, but we can cover that another time); and they wouldn't be able to take Use Magic Device at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the same way, saves get modifiers: Fortitude is modified by Constitution, Will by Wisdom, and Reflex by Dexterity.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps and doesn't simply muddy the waters further<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I hadn't examined Empyre's build before, but the Lore skill might give you pause for thought: it's modified by Intelligence, so you might expect 26 invested ranks to yield a modified 29 with 16 INT, but the Bard class gets a bonus to Lore for each level taken - 'cause it's a Bard - so the six levels of Bard give the extra 6 points in the skill.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Maybe it's a control thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nNonetheless, Jordus, go on, pick one and jump! If you're like me, you'll know by the time you hit about level 8 or 9 if a build feels right for you. If you're one of these determined \"I shall overcome,\" types, fine - me, I just want to enjoy myself, so I'll bin it if it ain't for me. Nothing wrong with a challenge or two, it helps you become a better player, and thus enjoy it more, but a grim slog through a campaign isn't exactly going to inspire you to go deeper, is it?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
