Looking for a Ranger/Assassin something...Yes i have a thing for Ranger/Assassins.... I was looking at Val's Night-Raider and liked the lvl split. So prob something along those lines with high lvl of assassin. My thoughts are I was thinking of a range dexer with high spot and listen. Assassin at lvl 8 get HiPS so thinking most of my damage is going to be from Death attacks in and out of the shadows. I really want to be stealthy too. Would a few lvls of Sorc help? I like ranger for the FE bonuses and the two spells camouflage and one with land, which should help with the steathly part. Race, What would be better Elf or Halfling? I want to be able to see people sneaking around as well as be a good sneaker as well.<br/>\n I am planning this for PvP. I can re-lvl once i get to 40 then change some feats if need be. I know I am forgetting something, just rusty from being gone. Thanks for any ideas and your time. Good to be back.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Now Halfling sounds cool...but I am guessing they can not use a longbow so is short bow will be alright or is Elf the better of the two races here so i can use a Longbow? Between I am looking up to see which will be best. Any thoughts on those races for this build? is the -2 str a big deal if I go halfling or wil the good-aim kinda make up for that?<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
