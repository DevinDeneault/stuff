      "content": "<div>David, it is extremely easy to build a pure fighter that passes all these requirements since you have ten tons of feats to work with.<br/>\nJust make sure you have 13+ intelligence &amp; 13+ dexterity so that you can take them while you level your character.<br/>\nCheck the Yardstick Builds thread for ideas &amp; sample builds, there are plenty of fighters in there.<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/concept-yardstick-builds-t2293896.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">concept-yardstick-builds-t2293896.html</a></div>"

The stats in parenthesis are what you should have in the first forty-levels, after that, everything is going to strength.<br/>\nDon't forget to tale luck of heroes &amp; iron will pre-epic to compensate for the low wisdom somewhat since you are forbidden to take CoT levels, although in such high-magic PWs immunities are running rampant.\u00a0 <br/>\nIf you want to fortify your saving-throws even more, leave Con:21 &amp; get epic will too.<br/>\nAnd that's it, you have so many feats that you can take everything you want &amp; you qualify for all of them due to your ability scores, Dex:14 &amp; Int:14.<br/>\nKnockdown, Improved Knockdown, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack, Called-Shot, Expertise &amp; Improve Expertise, are your requirements.</div>"
