A Smiter would be nice, but i wouldnt mind seeing a little less smite happy fellow either. COT is open to my concept. I would like the Race to be an Elf. A bit of use in PVP would be nice. i have no prefrence on weapon so it can be whatever! Thanks!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It can be worked into the build but don't expect one hit K.O's with him. Elf is also a bad race for a Paladin. Why don't you better tell us how you envision your character and we can go from there to create something that both is strong and has flavour. We can make use of the Gift's to strengthen the character, right?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
