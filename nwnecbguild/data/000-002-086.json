I'd go with Kukris for dual-slashing, and a Warhammer for when you need the extra AC boost. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'd tweak it slightly to try to start with 14 INT, and then I'd drop Improved Critical on the Bludgeoning weapon, since the threat range on those is quite underwhelming, and get Expertise. That would add versatility to the build, at the cost of HP. When you need a higher AC, you can go Warhammer / shield and fight in Expertise. When you want to dish out damage, switch to Kukris and crit their behinds off. <br/>\n<br/>\nVery good stuff!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
