I like Monk / Wizard / Assassin e.g. <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/pious-doom-in-a-tunic-monk-9-assassin-13-wizard-8-t515369.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">pious-doom-in-a-tunic-monk-9-assassin-1 ... 15369.html</a> but it has so little skill points. On the other hand, Rogue / SD / Assassin looks fun, but I do not know what would be better ranged or melee and everyone sticks with halfling (i don't like small races). Can anyone help me decide? :) I want to play SOU / HOTU with this toon.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It uses spells to disarm everything else.<br/>\nIt can open locks with a DC up to 35, and uses the Knock spell for the more difficult ones.<br/>\nIt also has a level 10 Familiar to help out with Rogue skills if you choose the Pixie.<br/>\nWith increasing Assassin levels it becomes a deadly stalker.<br/>\nEarly on it can operate as a \"spell-sword\".\u00a0 The arcane spells add to versatility throughout its career.<br/>\nDual wielding Kamas, it has 9 attacks per round buffed with Haste.<br/>\nIt has +10% speed from Monk. If you buff with Expeditious retreat it becomes super fast. Extend the spell if you want.<br/>\nThe BAB progression is slow during the first levels, but the high dexterity, the Monk attack schedule, the arcane spells and trap skills solve that. <br/>\nIt ends up with an AB of 41, which is very good for a \"Rogue type\" character.<br/>\nDeath attack DC is 39. Death attack damage is 13d6.

This build would have been number 8, 9, 10<br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic concept is to Hide, fire an arrow at enemy and watch it go SPLAT dead, in either 1 shot, or get paralyzed and die within 2,3,4 shots<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can use set traps as skill but really your going to be PARALYZING, DEATH ATTACKING, SPLATTING KILLING ENEMIES BEFORE THEY EVER SET OFF THE TRAP YOU SET.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso you can use a ranged bow and arrow to do a Assassin Death Attack, you dont have to hide, sneak up and sneak attack with a shortsword, Rapier, Scimitar, dagger, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can hide, sneak attack, death attack with bow, arrows.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you use set trap for is for things like Demons, devils, Undead that you cant death attack, sneak attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Mick or Stag, or whoever posted that Bard/AA/Assassin build can link that build here, I really recommend that you play that Bard/AA/Assassin over that Bard/AA/Blackguard<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

There are several ways to get it.<br/>\nRogue13<br/>\nSD10<br/>\nMonk9/SD5<br/>\nRogue10/SD5.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuilds with it is better than builds without. Monk9/SD5/Asn26 beats your mentioned Monk6/SD2-5/Asn28-32 in everything but DC to Death Attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nA side note here, you mention Asn 31+ a few times, but it's not possible to go past 30.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt all depends on the setting ofc, but usually you can't always sneak attack or stealth. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do you rank the Ranger over Rogue? A Rngr9 will gain 2 AB, but not much more. Less skillpoints, less Sneak dmg. With 6 Ranger you get Only 1 AB and doesn't even get ITWF. I wouldn't do it. <br/>\n<br/>\nMonk however, gives you a lot more than ranger. No AB, but a little AC, more attacks with better iteratives and movement speed. Also the IKD feats and with 9 lvls you smell the Epic Dodge. Monk items, but you probably have UMD.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Heavy Asn, I'd say Rogue and Monk are the best. This is my opinion and experience tho. Cleric and Bard is always good, I imagine Cleric15/asn25 is good, as Darkness is poor mans HiPS. Bard14/SD1/Asn25 smells good too. Curse Song wil improve your DA chances.<br/>\n<br/>\nSent fra min SM-G950F via Tapatalk<br/>\n<br/>\n<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
