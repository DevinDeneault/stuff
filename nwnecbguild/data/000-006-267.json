His weapons, are a two-handed axe and his natural 30 strength that compined with EWS. IKD, UMD shenanigans &amp; 9d6 Death attack will send his foes to the afterlife before they even realize what happened. His death attack DC isn't very high (although it is decent\u00a0to say the least) but you have to remember this is an extra, play him as a warrior that can stealth and do alpha strikes - not an assassin that can fight like an warrior. This dwarven lad is meant to fight all the time wearing his full plate armour and i made sure that he has more than adequate stealth skills to do that properly. As far as defences are concerned he has warrior-like hp's and a moderate ammount of damage reduction to further help him, expertise and dwarven stance are likewise in his disposal and due to his dwarven awareness he is immune to sneaks as long as he is attacking someone.<br/>\n<br/>\n There is one and only other assassin with this class combination, the\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build216100.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Iron Blood Assassin</a> by Xylophone but with his effective 36 AB he is not a contender.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>THE CAST-IRON BRAVO </strong><br/>\n<br/>\n (Fighter 8/ Assassin 18/ Dwarven Defender 14)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n RACE: Dwarf only<br/>\n<br/>\n ALIGNMENT: Lawful Evil<br/>\n<br/>\n PLAYABILITY: PvM, 1-40<br/>\n<br/>\n STARTING STATS:<br/>\n STR - 15<br/>\n DEX - 14<br/>\n CON -16<br/>\n INT -\u00a0 16<br/>\n WIS - 08<br/>\n CHA - 06<br/>\n<br/>\n ENDING STATS:<br/>\n STR - 30<br/>\n DEX - 14<br/>\n CON -16<br/>\n INT -\u00a0 16<br/>\n WIS - 08<br/>\n CHA - 06<br/>\n<br/>\n Hit Points: 516 (and DR 9/ \u2013 )<br/>\n<br/>\n Skill Points: 251 {cc Ranks for Hide &amp; Move Silently are accounted for}\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Tumble: 40 (42)<br/>\n UMD: 32 (30)<br/>\n Hide: 43 (57)<br/>\n Move Silently: 43 (57)<br/>\n Set Traps: 11 (15)<br/>\n Disable Traps: 15 (20)<br/>\n Spellcraft: 17 (20)<br/>\n Open Locks: 2 (4)<br/>\n Search: 15 (20)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fort/Ref/Will): 28/ 20/ 19 \u2192 34/ 26/ 25 (saves Vs spells)<br/>\n<br/>\n Naked AC: 22/ 29/ 34 (Mundane Full Plate) \u2192 (Defensive Stance) &amp; (Dodge) *<br/>\n<br/>\n * AC is listed without the aid of a shield<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n BAB: 29 (Four attacks)<br/>\n<br/>\n AB: +43/ +38/ +33/ +28 (Greataxe)<br/>\n<br/>\n DMG: 1D12 + 21 / 19-20 X3 (Greataxe) &amp; (9D6 Death Attack)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Death Attack DC: 31 (37) -- Paralyse for 18 Turns<br/>\n<br/>\n Spellcasting: UMD access to all items, scrolls and wands, Assassin spell-like abilities<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Dwarven Stance 7/ Day: +2 Strength/ +4 Constitution/ +2 to all saves/ +4 AC<br/>\n<br/>\n Defensive Awareness: Immune to sneak attack while he is attacking<br/>\n<br/>\n Deadly Trapmaster: He is able to find/ remove/ set deadly traps<br/>\n<br/>\n Poison Use: He is able to coat his\u00a0 weapons with poison<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n LEVELING GUIDE:<br/>\n 01) Fighter (01): Blind Fight, KD<br/>\n 02) Fighter (02): Expertise<br/>\n 03) Fighter (03): WF: Greataxe<br/>\n 04) Fighter (04): WS: Greataxe<br/>\n 05) Fighter (05):<br/>\n 06) Fighter (06): Toughness, Dodge<br/>\n 07) Fighter (07):<br/>\n 08) DD (01):<br/>\n 09) DD (02): IKD<br/>\n 10) DD (03):<br/>\n 11) DD (04):<br/>\n 12) DD (05): IC: Greataxe<br/>\n 13) DD (06):<br/>\n 14) DD (07):<br/>\n 15) DD (08): Great Fortitude<br/>\n 16) DD (09):<br/>\n 17) DD (10): {Hide &amp; Move Silently cc 8 ranks each}<br/>\n 18) Assassin (01): Stealthy<br/>\n 19) Assassin (02):<br/>\n 20) Assassin (03):<br/>\n 21) Fighter (08): EWF: Greataxe, EWS: Greataxe<br/>\n 22) Assassin (04):<br/>\n 23) Assassin (05):<br/>\n 24) Assassin (06): Armour Skin<br/>\n 25) Assassin (07):<br/>\n 26) Assassin (08):<br/>\n 27) Assassin (09): Great STR I<br/>\n 28) Assassin (10):<br/>\n 29) Assassin (11):<br/>\n 30) Assassin (12): Great STR II<br/>\n 31) Assassin (13):<br/>\n 32) Assassin (14): ESF: Hide<br/>\n 33) DD (11): Great STR III<br/>\n 34) DD (12):<br/>\n 35) DD (13):<br/>\n 36) DD (14): Great STR IV, Epic Prowess<br/>\n 37) Assassin (15):<br/>\n 38) Assassin (16):<br/>\n 39) Assassin (17): Great STR V<br/>\n 40) Assassin (18): ESF: Move Silently<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

AB +43 is all right for a warrior, and very good when attacking flat footed creatures from stealth or invisibility. The DA DC is not among the best, but this warrior has so much going for him that it doesn't really matter that much.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Been to two World Fairs, a rodeo and climbed a pyramid in Peru. This one takes the cake, Valerfor.<br/>\n<br/>\n A few questions/comments...<br/>\n<br/>\n Too bad you need to spend two feats just to compensate for the heavy plate. \u00a0I'd be interested to find out how the darkness works out because every attack will be a DA while inside the effect. \u00a0I wonder how many fort saves will be triggered inside. \u00a0 Might work better with a bow, though. Be even better if it could be extended. Coming out of invis or stealth gives one shot and then combat is engaged. \u00a0\n<blockquote><div><strong>Valerfor wrote:</strong><hr/>\n<em>--clip--</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>THE CAST-IRON BRAVO </strong><br/>\n<br/>\n (Fighter 8/ Assassin 18/ Dwarven Defender 14)<br/>\n<br/>\n ENDING STATS:<br/>\n INT -\u00a016<br/>\n<br/>\n SKILL<br/>\n UMD: 32 (30)<br/>\n<br/>\n Death Attack DC: 31 (37) -- Paralyse for 18 Turns<br/>\n<br/>\n Spellcasting: UMD access to all items, scrolls and wands, Assassin spell-like abilities<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>--clip--</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n Where is the DA DC of (37) coming from... by reaching ability caps like on a high-magic server? \u00a0If so, document these sorts of facts in your builds, please. \u00a0Just like unbuffed vs. buffed stats. \u00a0Same deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n With 4 more ranks in UMD (i.e. 36 (34) ), you'll be able to cast all Level 9 scrolls without failure. \u00a0Steal 4 from Search since your toon still must wait for the OnHeartbeat event to cycle through anyway.\u00a0 Consume a Fox potion or 2 before venturing if you are overly concerned about trap spotting.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
