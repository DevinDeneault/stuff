      "content": "<div>Recently I noticed that there are very few dedicated stunners on the ECB. In NWN EE Stunning Fist has been nerfed so that it only lasts for 1 round rather than 3 rounds but it is still an incredibly powerful feat. This nerf limits chain stunning and consequently relegates many stunners to support roles, but it is possible to make decent dedicated stunners in NWN EE.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the DC numbers in this post assume +12 WIS from buffs, subtract 6 from all DCs for the naked DCs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe seven builds in this thread are minmaxed for high DCs, they are not designed to be playable in their current forms. They are mainly meant to inspire other stunner builds, feel free to edit them or use the concepts in your own stunners. I might post playable variants in the level 40 section at some point but these particular versions are not good enough to be posted there. For inexperienced builders who are not sure how to make these builds playable, in general you should decrease starting DEX/WIS, improve the AB by increasing DEX and adding AB feats, and lower the DC by dropping WIS and ISF feats. 20 WIS and ISF10 results in a 61 DC Stunning Fist at level 40, this is usually the DC I aim for when making stunners. Since these are just rough builds to showcase stunners I haven't made full skill progressions for any of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe seven builds below are:<br/>\nMonk20/CoT10/Figh10 - Maximum DC Stunner (23x 69 DC)<br/>\nDruid20/CoT10/Figh10 - Maximum DC Dragon Stunner (13x 68 DC)<br/>\nMonk6/Cler26/Figh8 - Battle Cleric Stunner (9x 67 DC)<br/>\nMonk20/Pal4/Figh16 - Divine Might Stunner (23x 66 DC)<br/>\nDru24/Monk6/Figh10 - Generic Dragon Stunner (9x 66 DC)<br/>\nMonk21/Figh14/SD5 - Generic Stunner (24x 64 DC)<br/>\nRog13/Monk21/Figh6 - Crippling Stunner (24x 62 DC)<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nBelow is a list of 51+ DC stunner builds in the archives and forum:<br/>\n<br/>\nBard20/CoT18/Wiz2 by Ithacan (10x 59 DC).

CoT10 gives access to Divine Wrath with +5 AB and +5 unblockable divine damage, however even with +12 CHA this is limited to a 5 round duration. Since Stunning Fist only works if your attack actually damages your opponent, this unblockable damage can be used to stun opponents that would otherwise be immune due to high DI/DR.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to make this playable, lower the starting stats to 18DEX/16WIS in order to increase the other abilities. Increase BAB to 16 by changing the pre-epic level spread and focus on DEX rather than WIS in order to improve AB. Finally, take weapon feats such as EWF: Unarmed and EWS: Unarmed to improve the build's offensive capabilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nClass: Monk 20 / Champion Of Torm 10 / Fighter 10<br/>\nRace: Halfling<br/>\nAlignment: Lawful Good / Lawful Neutral<br/>\nPlayability: N/A<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 7<br/>\nDEX: 19<br/>\nCON: 8<br/>\nWIS: 18 (36)<br/>\nINT: 8<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Monk(1): Blind Fight<br/>\n02: Monk(2)<br/>\n03: Monk(3): Weapon Finesse<br/>\n04: Monk(4): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br/>\n05: Monk(5)<br/>\n06: Monk(6): Zen Archery<br/>\n07: Monk(7)<br/>\n08: Monk(8): WIS+1, (WIS=20)<br/>\n09: Monk(9): Weapon Focus: Unarmed<br/>\n10: Monk(10)<br/>\n11: Monk(11)<br/>\n12: Monk(12): WIS+1, Weapon Focus: Kama, (WIS=21)<br/>\n13: Monk(13)<br/>\n14: Monk(14)<br/>\n15: Monk(15): Improved Critical: Unarmed<br/>\n16: Monk(16): WIS+1, (WIS=22)<br/>\n17: Monk(17)<br/>\n18: Monk(18): Extra Stunning Attacks<br/>\n19: Monk(19)<br/>\n20: Champion of Torm(1): WIS+1, (WIS=23)<br/>\n21: Champion of Torm(2): Great Wisdom I, Great Wisdom II, (WIS=25)<br/>\n22: Champion of Torm(3)<br/>\n23: Champion of Torm(4): Great Wisdom III, (WIS=26)<br/>\n24: Champion of Torm(5): WIS+1, Great Wisdom IV, (WIS=28)<br/>\n25: Champion of Torm(6): Great Wisdom V, (WIS=29)<br/>\n26: Champion of Torm(7)<br/>\n27: Champion of Torm(8): Great Wisdom VI, Great Wisdom VII, (WIS=31)<br/>\n28: Champion of Torm(9): WIS+1, (WIS=32)<br/>\n29: Champion of Torm(10): Great Wisdom VIII, (WIS=33)<br/>\n30: Fighter(1): Improved Stunning Fist I, Improved Stunning Fist II<br/>\n31: Fighter(2): Improved Stunning Fist III<br/>\n32: Fighter(3): WIS+1, (WIS=34)<br/>\n33: Fighter(4): Improved Stunning Fist IV, Improved Stunning Fist V<br/>\n34: Fighter(5)<br/>\n35: Fighter(6): Improved Stunning Fist VI<br/>\n36: Fighter(7): WIS+1, Improved Stunning Fist VII, (WIS=35)<br/>\n37: Monk(20)<br/>\n38: Fighter(8): Improved Stunning Fist VIII<br/>\n39: Fighter(9): Improved Stunning Fist IX<br/>\n40: Fighter(10): WIS+1, Improved Stunning Fist X, (WIS=36)<br/>\n<br/>\nDisable Trap 1(0), Discipline 39(37), Open Lock 1(5), Pick Pocket 1(5), Set Trap 1(5), Spellcraft 1(0), Tumble 40(44)<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nNaked Stats<br/>\nHitpoints: 320<br/>\nSkillpoints: 89<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 28/40/33<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Mind Effects: +2, Fear: +2<br/>\nBAB: 25<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 31 (melee), 40 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 40/40<br/>\nSpell Casting:\u00a0<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nBuffed Stats (Assuming +12 DEX, +12 CON, +12 WIS, +5 AB weapons, +5 AC items, and Haste)<br/>\nAB (Unarmed): 25 (BAB) + 10 (DEX) + 1 (Feats) + 5 (AB Bonus) + 1 (Size) = +42<br/>\nAB (Sling): 25 (BAB) + 19 (WIS) + 5 (AB Bonus) + 1 (Race) + 1 (Size) = +51<br/>\nAC: 10 (Base) + 10 (DEX) + 19 (WIS) + 8 (Tumble) + 4 (Monk Bonus) + 20 (AC Bonus) + 4 (Haste) + 1 (Size) = 76<br/>\nHP: 360 (Base) + 200 (CON) = 560<br/>\nFortitude: 23 (Base) + 5 (CON) + 1 (Race) + 5 (CoT) = 34<br/>\nReflex: 23 (Base) + 10 (CON) + 1 (Race) + 5 (CoT) = 39<br/>\nWill: 21 (Base) + 19 (WIS) + 1 (Race) + 5 (CoT) = 46</div>"

Dragon Shape is a great fit for Stunning Fist since all dragon builds naturally have a high WIS score. They also don't suffer from the poor AB or damage most stunners have since they get a high STR score when shifted. This build gets Dragon Shape at level 30, it's not possible to move it any earlier and still reach the maximum DC.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I wouldn't bother trying to make this build playable, if you want a dragon stunner make a Dru/Monk/Figh. It gets a better attack progression and better AC, the only downside is less room for ISF feats.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nClass: Druid 20 / Champion Of Torm 10 / Fighter 10<br/>\nRace: Halfling<br/>\nAlignment: CN / LN / NG / TN<br/>\nPlayability: N/A<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 7<br/>\nDEX: 19<br/>\nCON: 8<br/>\nWIS: 18 (34)<br/>\nINT: 8<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Druid(1): Blind Fight<br/>\n02: Druid(2)<br/>\n03: Druid(3): Improved Unarmed Strike<br/>\n04: Druid(4): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br/>\n05: Druid(5)<br/>\n06: Druid(6): Weapon Focus: Dagger<br/>\n07: Druid(7)<br/>\n08: Druid(8): WIS+1, (WIS=20)<br/>\n09: Druid(9): Knockdown<br/>\n10: Druid(10)<br/>\n11: Druid(11)<br/>\n12: Druid(12): WIS+1, Improved Critical: Unarmed, (WIS=21)<br/>\n13: Druid(13)<br/>\n14: Druid(14)<br/>\n15: Druid(15): Stunning Fist<br/>\n16: Druid(16): WIS+1, (WIS=22)<br/>\n17: Druid(17)<br/>\n18: Druid(18): Extra Stunning Attacks<br/>\n19: Druid(19)<br/>\n20: Champion of Torm(1): WIS+1, (WIS=23)<br/>\n21: Champion of Torm(2): Epic Prowess, Great Wisdom I, (WIS=24)<br/>\n22: Champion of Torm(3)<br/>\n23: Champion of Torm(4): Great Wisdom II, (WIS=25)<br/>\n24: Champion of Torm(5): WIS+1, Great Wisdom III, (WIS=27)<br/>\n25: Champion of Torm(6): Great Wisdom IV, (WIS=28)<br/>\n26: Champion of Torm(7)<br/>\n27: Champion of Torm(8): Great Wisdom V, Great Wisdom VI, (WIS=30)<br/>\n28: Champion of Torm(9): WIS+1, (WIS=31)<br/>\n29: Champion of Torm(10): Improved Stunning Fist I<br/>\n30: Druid(20): Dragon Shape<br/>\n31: Fighter(1): Improved Stunning Fist II<br/>\n32: Fighter(2): WIS+1, Improved Stunning Fist III, (WIS=32)<br/>\n33: Fighter(3): Improved Stunning Fist IV<br/>\n34: Fighter(4): Improved Stunning Fist V<br/>\n35: Fighter(5)<br/>\n36: Fighter(6): WIS+1, Improved Stunning Fist VI, Improved Stunning Fist VII, (WIS=33)<br/>\n37: Fighter(7)<br/>\n38: Fighter(8): Improved Stunning Fist VIII<br/>\n39: Fighter(9): Improved Stunning Fist IX<br/>\n40: Fighter(10): WIS+1, Improved Stunning Fist X, (WIS=34)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnimal Empathy 1(0), Concentration 39(38), Disable Trap 1(0), Open Lock 1(5), Pick Pocket 1(5), Set Trap 1(5), Spellcraft 1(0), Tumble 20(24)<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nNaked Stats<br/>\nHitpoints: 320<br/>\nSkillpoints: 89<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 28/39/28<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Fear: +4<br/>\nBAB: 25<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 26 (melee), 32 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 19/26<br/>\nSpell Casting: Druid(9)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nBuffed Stats (While shifted, assuming +12 STR, +12 CON, +12 WIS, one +5 AC item, and Haste)<br/>\nAB: 25 (Base) + 25 (STR) + 1 (Feats) + 6 (EB Bonus) - 2 (Size) = +55 (+57 outside)<br/>\nAC: 10 (Base) + 13 (DEX) + 4 (Tumble) + 5 (AC Bonus) + 5 (Barkskin) + 20 (Shape Dodge Bonus) - 2 (Size) = 55<br/>\nHP: 360 (Base) + 680 (CON) = 1040<br/>\nFortitude: 23 (Base) + 17 (CON) + 1 (Race) + 5 (CoT) = 46<br/>\nReflex: 18 (Base) + 13 (DEX) + 1 (Race) + 5 (CoT) = 37<br/>\nWill: 21 (Base) + 18 (WIS) + 1 (Race) + 5 (CoT) = 45</div>"

      "content": "<div>Monk6/Cler26/Figh8 - 9x 67 DC Stunning Fist<br/>\n<br/>\nBattle clerics make for great stunners due to Cleric buffs alleviating the AB issues most stunners have. Even caster clerics can be decent stunners due to their AB buffs and high WIS. The damage from Battletide and Divine Favor bypasses DI/DR so there's no need to worry about high DI/DR blocking the stun attempt. This build has only 6 base Stunning Fist attempts per day because it has 6 Monk levels, Extra Stunning Attacks increases this to 9 per day. It would actually have more Stunning Fist attempts if it had no Monk levels, since it would have 10 base attempts per day from being level 40.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to make this playable, I recommend increasing the Monk levels to at least 10. A Monk10/Cler26/Figh4 can still reach a decent DC even if it is built with EWS: Unarmed and a lower WIS. Lower starting DEX and WIS in order to boost the other abilities, particularly INT due to the low number of skill points. Even when fully buffed the unarmed damage is pretty low compared to kama damage, it might be worth focusing on both unarmed strike and kamas.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nClass: Monk 6 / Cleric 26 / Fighter 8<br/>\nRace: Halfling<br/>\nAlignment: Any Lawful<br/>\nPlayability: N/A<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 7<br/>\nDEX: 19<br/>\nCON: 8<br/>\nWIS: 18 (32)<br/>\nINT: 8<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Monk(1): Blind Fight<br/>\n02: Cleric(1): Domain Trickery, Domain War<br/>\n03: Cleric(2): Weapon Finesse<br/>\n04: Cleric(3): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br/>\n05: Cleric(4)<br/>\n06: Cleric(5): Extend Spell<br/>\n07: Monk(2)<br/>\n08: Cleric(6): WIS+1, (WIS=20)<br/>\n09: Cleric(7): Weapon Focus: Unarmed<br/>\n10: Cleric(8)<br/>\n11: Cleric(9)<br/>\n12: Monk(3): WIS+1, Improved Critical: Unarmed, (WIS=21)<br/>\n13: Cleric(10)<br/>\n14: Cleric(11)<br/>\n15: Cleric(12): Silent Spell<br/>\n16: Cleric(13): WIS+1, (WIS=22)<br/>\n17: Monk(4)<br/>\n18: Cleric(14): Extra Stunning Attacks<br/>\n19: Cleric(15)<br/>\n20: Cleric(16): WIS+1, (WIS=23)<br/>\n21: Cleric(17): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=24)<br/>\n22: Cleric(18)<br/>\n23: Cleric(19)<br/>\n24: Cleric(20): WIS+1, Great Wisdom II, (WIS=26)<br/>\n25: Cleric(21)<br/>\n26: Cleric(22)<br/>\n27: Monk(5): Improved Stunning Fist I<br/>\n28: Cleric(23): WIS+1, Great Wisdom III, (WIS=28)<br/>\n29: Cleric(24)<br/>\n30: Fighter(1): Improved Stunning Fist II, Improved Stunning Fist III<br/>\n31: Fighter(2): Improved Stunning Fist IV<br/>\n32: Fighter(3): WIS+1, (WIS=29)<br/>\n33: Fighter(4): Improved Stunning Fist V, Improved Stunning Fist VI<br/>\n34: Cleric(25)<br/>\n35: Fighter(5)<br/>\n36: Fighter(6): WIS+1, Improved Stunning Fist VII, Improved Stunning Fist VIII, (WIS=30)<br/>\n37: Monk(6)<br/>\n38: Fighter(7)<br/>\n39: Fighter(8): Improved Stunning Fist IX, Improved Stunning Fist X<br/>\n40: Cleric(26): WIS+1, Great Wisdom IV, (WIS=32)<br/>\n<br/>\nConcentration 12(11), Disable Trap 1(0), Open Lock 1(5), Pick Pocket 1(5), Set Trap 1(5), Spellcraft 1(0), Tumble 40(44)<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nNaked Stats<br/>\nHitpoints: 296<br/>\nSkillpoints: 61<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 24/36/24<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Mind Effects: +2, Fear: +2<br/>\nBAB: 25<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 31 (melee), 31 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 35/35<br/>\nSpell Casting: Cleric(9)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nBuffed Stats (Assuming +12 DEX, +12 CON, +12 WIS, +5 AB gloves, +5 AC items, and Haste)<br/>\nAB: 25 (BAB) + 10 (DEX) + 5 (AB Bonus) + 1 (Aid) + 2 (Battletide) + 1 (Bless) + 5 (Divine Favor) + 5 (Divine Power) + 1 (Prayer) + 1 (Size) = +56<br/>\nAC: 10 (Base) + 10 (DEX) + 17 (WIS) + 8 (Tumble) + 1 (Monk Bonus) + 20 (AB Bonus) + 4 (Haste) + 1 (Size) = 71<br/>\nHP: 336 (Base) + 200 (CON) = 536<br/>\nFortitude: 24 (Base) + 5 (CON) + 1 (Race) = 30<br/>\nReflex: 19 (Base) + 10 (DEX) + 1 (Race) = 30<br/>\nWill: 24 (Base) + 17 (WIS) + 1 (Race) = 42</div>"

      "content": "<div>Monk20/Pal4/Figh16 - 23x 66 DC Stunning Fist<br/>\n<br/>\nThis build works best in environments where abilities are fairly easy to cap, almost every ability is important. Divine Might bypasses DI/DR and so stunning attempts can't be blocked by high DI/DR.
