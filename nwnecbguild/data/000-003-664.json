      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I'm going to assume your damage will come from scaring the bejesus out of them then sneaking or hipsing then sneaking, or possibly all of the above - popping in from the shadows, shouting \"Boo!\" scarily and sneaking them. In any case, that means the higher sneaks you get the better, no? And that surely means the more Rogue the better. Thus I'd be thinking at least 15 or 17 levels of Rogue (my temptation would actually be 17 or 19 for 9 or 10d6), which means Yunim's dead right, you can't really afford more than SD cheese - assuming you want a very angry Hin indeed...<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: I'm also a wee bit concerned about your feats. Of your 7 pre-epics, I'm assuming Dodge, Mobility, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus, Blind Fight and Knockdown are already taken. Because you're a WoGster you'd probably then also grab <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Sharpen Pencil</span> Craft Wand rather than IKD (unavailable with your current Int) or Improved Critical. Leaving none. Then in epic (again an assumption) the Rogue bonus feats could be Improved Evasion, Defensive Roll and Epic Dodge (if you go for the 17 or 19 levels of the class - the 19 also enabling Crippling Strike). That leaves a further 7 feats, and I'd guess at EWF and Epic Prowess being 2, to sit alongside the 3 EDRs and the Terrifying Rage. Which leaves 1 spare for a Great Dex or Con - so I'll presume Dex so (with your 10 stat boosts) you'll end up with Dex 26 and Con 21. It ain't spectacular, Web. Of course, I may have all my assumptions wrong, in which case what do I know?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It's like a sneaky hipsing scarer with a big surprise in store for enemies!<br/>\nI would follow Yunim's suggestion and get more rogue and lower SD to 1<br/>\nYou'd get more sneak damage.<br/>\nI like Yunim's halfling Dex 18 con 16 split it has great AB with a ranged weapon or weapon finesse from level 1 plus small size and you avoid multiclass penalties.<br/>\nStr can be 10 and Int 14 to incorporate IKD somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nHalf orc would also be fun too. You'd get piles of skill points from rogue and Barb to compensate for Int penalties and kudos for making a decent half orc build<br/>\n<br/>\nSee If you can get Base AB to 40 or more then it is looking very playable.
