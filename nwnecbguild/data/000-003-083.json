Who would have ever thought... A drow priestess and a bunch of humanoid smitey paladins would ganged up to wreck my day. You know... before turning on each other.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, by the title you obviously came into possession. 'Monk' that's right a monk. But, not a strength monk that's been running around everywhere, oh no. I thought it might be cool to make a monk, with a Dex build, debating on the Kamas. I thought about an elf due to how they get a dex boost naturally<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, for Arelith lv 30 environment with a 3 level prequisite before changing classes. I thought of something. What could a good Monk DEX build look like? Then, it kinda came to me. The not so original idea and maybe bad one (you guys can correct me if I'm wrong here.) I thought about a<br/>\n<br/>\n Monk 20/ ShadowDancer 5/ Rogue 5, Elf build (with kamas, someone might have to tell me the advantage of doing kama or fists...)<br/>\n<br/>\n Why?<br/>\n Rogue gets hiding/stealth and trap related things, I thought this could help alongside UMD<br/>\n Unless, giving up all magical scrolls for perma haste +10 discipline, and immunity to paralysis, slows, and movements effects is a good trade off.<br/>\n Shadowdancer for <ul><li>Their Shadow Evade now lasts 3 rounds per class level.</li> <li>A +1 bonus to Hide is given with each SD level taken.</li> <li>Hide in Plain Sight feat (HiPS) will be granted at SD level 5 instead of 1.<ul><li>After leaving stealth mode, HIPS will have 2 rounds of cooldown before it can be used again. Note that other ways of sneaking, such as corner-sneaking, still work while the cooldown is in effect.</li> </ul></li></ul> Summon Shadow: <ul><li>Infinite uses/day, but instead has a cooldown of 3 minutes starting the moment the shadow is slain or dismissed.</li> <li>The Shadowdancer gains a d6 of improved sneak attack (feat) per three levels of the Shadow when standing near it.</li> <li>The shadow mirrors the Shadowdancer in several ways:<ul><li>They copy the <strong>final</strong> physical stats, not the base.</li> <li>They mirror the weapon, but theirs have the \"no damage\" property, and they cannot use shields or ranged weapons.</li> <li>If the Shadowdancer has the epic shadowlord feat, the shadows copies the names, description, portrait, and soundset of the shadowdancer.</li> <li>They copy Weapon Finesse and all Dual Wield feats, if the shadowdacer has them.</li> </ul></li><li>Shadows Feats: Blind Fight, Crippling Strike, Sneak Attack (+1d6).</li> <li>Shadows gain the Hide in Plain Sight feat if the master has at least 5 Shadowdancer levels.</li> <li>Shadow Skills: Discipline Hide, Move Silently, Listen, Spot.</li> <li>Shadow Properties: DR 5/+1, 55% Concealment + 1% / Shadowdancer Level, Undead Immunities.</li> <li>Shadows level up to 5 + Shadowdancer Class Level using the Outsider class</li> <li>The Epic Shadow Lord feat grants the Shadow +5% Concealment, +5 Hit Dice</li> </ul> I thought that the HIPS might benefit well as well as shadow evade, etc. But, I have no idea. That's why I came here for help.<br/>\n<br/>\n If I missed something please let me know<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The problem with this kind of request is that I'm not familiar with Arelith enough to know whether what I can suggest wors the same way as intended there.

Because the main \"cool\" aspects of Monk are attained on Monk levels 1-9. A Kama Monk won't need to go past 9 Monk, as you need Improved Evasion for Epic Dodge.

This build I suggested would have Sneak Attack as its main source of damage, and would automatically be inherently weak against any Sneak Immune monsters / enemies (Dwarven Defenders and Pale Masters, for example). Dex Monks don't do much damage, unless you go for Cleric / Monk, but that's more Cleric than Monk, so a completely different build in itself. However, you'd be great against heavy-hitting Meleers with HiPS and so much SA damage. You'd most likely fail your KD attempts, but you wouldn't need them coming out of the shadows and catching them flat-footed with 19 Rogue levels. Dex Monks with Hips have really high AC and Epic Dodge, so they can avoid a lot of damage and use sneaky tactics to overwhelm their opponents. And they're probably the best there are at that!<br/>\n<br/>\n I don't know how much non-sneak damage you would do because I don't know what kind of items are available on the server, but you'd need to rely on UMD scrolls and wands to buff up your weapons. If you have access to Greater Magic Weapon and Flame Weapon wands, that alone will increase your damage output at least threefold.

The prime difference I've found is that, with the Dexer, it's really not \"dodge and hope you don't go splat\". Your AC can reach astronomic levels, and what isn't covered directly by AC is handled by ED, Defensive Roll and Imp Evasion, so it becomes more like hitting smoke. Yes, in a toe-to-toe fight, you will be chipping away delicately, but very, very often -and with HiPS or even \"normal\" stealth skills, Sneak Attack and Crippling Strike are your best friends. And Finesse comes in very handy for KD/IKD for AB against those nasty mages, too. Basically, it's that a DEX monk requires a whole different mind-set from a STR one. And you still have Imp Unarmed Attack anyway, so you can always don the mittens for those requiring bludgeoning.<br/>\n<br/>\n Don't get me wrong, my preferred style will likely always be to stand there as a bloke in a frock and say, \"bring it on\", but I'm appreciating the stealthy little bastards more and more as I go on. The statue of David wasn't created by one big thump, but lots of little chips, after all. <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT</strong></em>: Bloody hell - double ninja-ed!</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Can you help? Also, I know you can add the 'Keen' property to weapons, alongside enhancing them with 1d4 (insert sonic, acid, cold, divine, etc dmg here) Though, I don't know how helpful that would be compared to Flame weapon or Magic weapon (since the higher level kamas will likely have 'effects on them already' which I think is suppose to negate the flame weapon at least (not sure.)

Also, there are exactly 62 extra skill points, which means you can have two full skills more than what you actually have. Your choice is to lower INT and take away one of those, but that may make it so that you don't have enough skill points for everything that you need. But if you do keep it as is, I suggest you wait until epic levels to start taking them, because around level 15 you'll have a skill point shortage.<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, here it is!<br/>\n<br/>\n

As a non-human, you give up one feat, and a few skill points if I recall. But, would an elf not be better? You give up the improved sneak attack 1, yes. But, you can get 18 dex whilst getting 12 CON. Even then (quote me if I'm wrong, for these examples I will be taking the +2 Dex gift into effect.) Assuming elf doesn't work (maybe it's that feat thing, like you say. I don't know much about building melee builds truthfully.) Could you not do 16 Dex to start, and then gain 14 CON with the human? Due to the Dex gift, it would again start at 18. Thus, regaining that loss soon after, but with enhanced CON. Get back to me on this though, I might be off my rocker with this logic xD<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n In another regard, this is just for my knowledge. Any special reason to forgo Discipline? Looking at the AC 28. (I think that's a bit high, but would I not be subject to constant knockdowns?)

The feats that you'd have to choose from in terms of dropping are all the pre-epic feats.<br/>\n<br/>\n Going Elf would mean Experience Penalty, so I'd be more inclined to switch to Halfling, if anything. But then you'd have to drop a VERY IMPORTANT feat:<br/>\n<br/>\n Dodge - SD requirement, undroppable<br/>\n Mobility - SD requirement, Undroppable<br/>\n Weapon Finesse - Impossible to drop for a DEXer<br/>\n Weapon Focus - Undroppable<br/>\n TWF/ Ambidexterity/ ITWF - Undroppable if you want this toon to be a surprise sneaker with loads of attacks per round<br/>\n That leaves Blind Fight, which would make fighting Concealed monsters a NIGHTMARE!<br/>\n<br/>\n So no, I would not advise you to switch race.<br/>\n However, that doesn't mean you can't drop Improved Sneak Attack if you don't want it, however, you need to select a feat that is in the Rogue bonus feat list. ESF: Move Silently is a good alternative if you want.<br/>\n<br/>\n Your AC is 28 naked without gear or buffs, but you can add AC by buffing Wisdom and DEX and also from robes, boots (Monk Boots), plus all other buffs you can get through UMD scrolls and wands. So your AC will always be higher than your Discipline roll. I never take Discipline on my DEXers, and I'm sort of an expert on the subject.
