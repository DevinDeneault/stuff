The Dragon Savant is no exception--it possesses power beyond what most people can comprehend! The epitome of self-discipline and nobility, protecting Dwarven Law and nature reside within the Dragon Savant's thoughts and cling close to its heart. Born a dwarf, walks as a dragon, with his power the Dragon Savant defends dwarves and destroys their enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\n Druid(14), Monk(12), Dwarven Defender(14), Dwarf, Lawful Neutral<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 8<br/>\n DEX: 14<br/>\n CON: 12<br/>\n WIS: 18 (32)<br/>\n INT: 14<br/>\n CHA: 6<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Druid(1): Toughness<br/>\n 02: Monk(1)<br/>\n 03: Monk(2): Dodge<br/>\n 04: Monk(3): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br/>\n 05: Druid(2)<br/>\n 06: Druid(3): Zen Archery<br/>\n 07: Druid(4)<br/>\n 08: Monk(4): WIS+1, (WIS=20)<br/>\n 09: Monk(5): Disarm<br/>\n 10: Druid(5)<br/>\n 11: Druid(6)<br/>\n 12: Monk(6): WIS+1, Improved Disarm, (WIS=21)<br/>\n 13: Druid(7)<br/>\n 14: Dwarven Defender(1)<br/>\n 15: Dwarven Defender(2): Extend Spell<br/>\n 16: Dwarven Defender(3): WIS+1, (WIS=22)<br/>\n 17: Dwarven Defender(4)<br/>\n 18: Dwarven Defender(5): Resist Energy: Cold<br/>\n 19: Dwarven Defender(6)<br/>\n 20: Dwarven Defender(7): WIS+1, (WIS=23)<br/>\n 21: Dwarven Defender(8): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=24)<br/>\n 22: Dwarven Defender(9)<br/>\n 23: Dwarven Defender(10)<br/>\n 24: Druid(8): WIS+1, Great Wisdom II, (WIS=26)<br/>\n 25: Druid(9)<br/>\n 26: Monk(7)<br/>\n 27: Monk(8): Great Wisdom III, (WIS=27)<br/>\n 28: Monk(9): WIS+1, (WIS=28)<br/>\n 29: Druid(10)<br/>\n 30: Druid(11): Great Wisdom IV, (WIS=29)<br/>\n 31: Druid(12)<br/>\n 32: Druid(13): WIS+1, (WIS=30)<br/>\n 33: Druid(14): Dragon Shape<br/>\n 34: Dwarven Defender(11)<br/>\n 35: Dwarven Defender(12)<br/>\n 36: Dwarven Defender(13): WIS+1, Armor Skin, (WIS=31)<br/>\n 37: Dwarven Defender(14): Epic Prowess<br/>\n 38: Monk(10)<br/>\n 39: Monk(11): Epic Energy Resistance: Cold I<br/>\n 40: Monk(12): WIS+1, (WIS=32)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 456<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 26/36/21<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9, Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +1, Poison: +2, Fear: +2<br/>\n BAB: 26<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 26 (melee), 38 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 35/35<br/>\n<br/>\n Skillpoints: 230<br/>\n Animal Empathy 36(34), Discipline 43(42), Hide 16(18), Listen 43(54), Move Silently 16(18), Spellcraft 36(38),<br/>\n Tumble 40(42)<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Animal Empathy(4), Spellcraft(4), Save(16),<br/>\n 02: Discipline(5), Listen(5), Tumble(5), Save(7),<br/>\n 03: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Tumble(1), Save(10),<br/>\n 04: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Tumble(1), Save(13),<br/>\n 05: Animal Empathy(4), Spellcraft(4), Save(11),<br/>\n 06: Animal Empathy(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(15),<br/>\n 07: Animal Empathy(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(19),<br/>\n 08: Discipline(4), Listen(4), Tumble(4), Save(13),<br/>\n 09: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Tumble(1), Save(16),<br/>\n 10: Animal Empathy(2), Spellcraft(2), Save(18),<br/>\n 11: Animal Empathy(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(22),<br/>\n 12: Discipline(3), Listen(3), Tumble(3), Save(19),<br/>\n 13: Animal Empathy(2), Spellcraft(2), Save(21),<br/>\n 14: Discipline(2), Listen(2), Save(21),<br/>\n 15: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(23),<br/>\n 16: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(25),<br/>\n 17: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(27),<br/>\n 18: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(29),<br/>\n 19: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(31),<br/>\n 20: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(33),<br/>\n 21: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(35),<br/>\n 22: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(37),<br/>\n 23: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(39),<br/>\n 24: Animal Empathy(11), Spellcraft(11), Save(23),<br/>\n 25: Animal Empathy(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(27),<br/>\n 26: Discipline(3), Hide(3), Listen(3), Move Silently(3), Tumble(13), Save(8),<br/>\n 27: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(1), Save(9),<br/>\n 28: Discipline(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(1), Save(10),<br/>\n 29: Animal Empathy(4), Spellcraft(4), Save(8),<br/>\n 30: Animal Empathy(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(12),<br/>\n 31: Animal Empathy(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(16),<br/>\n 32: Animal Empathy(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(20),<br/>\n 33: Animal Empathy(2), Spellcraft(2), Save(22),<br/>\n 34: Discipline(6), Listen(6), Save(14),<br/>\n 35: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(16),<br/>\n 36: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(18),<br/>\n 37: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(20),<br/>\n 38: Discipline(1), Hide(4), Move Silently(4), Tumble(10), Save(7),<br/>\n 39: Discipline(1), Hide(2), Listen(1), Move Silently(2), Save(7),<br/>\n 40: Discipline(1), Hide(5), Listen(2), Move Silently(5),<br/>\n<br/>\n Background, Analysis and Comments by Author<br/>\n<br/>\n Equipment<br/>\n Clothes<br/>\n Long Bow<br/>\n<br/>\n Dragon Savant Abilities<br/>\n The Dragon Savant relies upon divine spell casting and training as a Dwarven Defender to make himself a bastion of resilience and endurance.<br/>\n<br/>\n Divine Spell Casting:<br/>\n Focusing almost exclusively on buffing spells, the Dragon Savant is able to significantly enhance his capabilities through spell casting fuelled by his connection to nature. The standard spell memorization of the Dragon Savant is as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\n Level 1: Ultravision x1, Camouflage x1, Magic Fang x1, CLW x5<br/>\n Level 2: Extended Camouflage x1, Charm Person or Animal x2, Lesser Restore x4<br/>\n Level 3: Extended Blood Frenzy x3 (+2 str/con +1 will, -1 AC for 2.8 turns), 2x Extended Barkskin, 1x Extended One with the Land, 1x Extended Bull's Strength<br/>\n Level 4: 1x Mass Camouflage, 1x Stoneskin, 2x Hold Monster, 1x Extended Greater Magic Fang, 1x Extended Protection from Elements<br/>\n Level 5: 1x Awaken, 1x Owl's Insight, 1x Spell Resistance, 1x Death Ward, 1x Extended Freedom of Movement<br/>\n Level 6: 2x Regenerate, 1x Extended Owl's Insight, 1x Energy Buffer, 1x Greater Stoneskin<br/>\n Level 7: 2x Heal, 2x Extended Regenerate<br/>\n<br/>\n Dwarven Defender Capabilities: Through his training amongst the ranks of the legendary Dwarven Defenders, the Dragon Savant has learnt many invaluable techniques. Through extensive training drills, the Dragon Savant has toughened his skin to the point where he can shrug off 9 points of damage from any physical source, turning any major blow into a minor one, and completely disregarding many minor blows. The Dragon Savant can also take on a Defensive Stance, boosting their strength, constitution, saving throws, and ability to dodge incoming blows.<br/>\n<br/>\n Monk Training: The Dragon Savant spent many years at a monastery that was home to an order of nature loving monks and learned many defensive capabilities. The Dragon Savant may Evade many spells or Resist them entirely, Deflect Arrows, and move with great speed. He can also still his Mind to protect against enchantments and Purify his Body to be as tough as a Diamond, to become immune to common diseases and all poisons. The Dragon Savant has also learned to turn their entire body into a weapon, allowing them to fight furiously when unarmed, striking frequently with a Flurry of Blows. Best of all, the Dragon Savant may use their perceptiveness of the world around them to their advantage in combat, allowing the Dragon Savant to apply his Wisdom bonus to his Armour Class.<br/>\n<br/>\n Druidic Lore: Through long periods of communing with nature, the Dragon Savant knows when to step lightly and not walk on the grass. The Dragon Savant has attracted a loyal animal companion who provides pleasant company during the long treks between adventures. Through his Animal Empathy, the Dragon Savant may charm animals to fight at his side. He has also mastered the art of Wild Shaping himself into many different animal forms, though of course, none of them compare to his awe inspiring draconic form.<br/>\n<br/>\n Dragon Form: The central element of the Dragon Savant is the ability for him to shift into the form of a Dragon, three times per day, for a maximum of 14 hours at a time. When in Dragon Form and empowered by Divine Spells, the Dragon Savant's combat skills are positively awe inspiring.<br/>\n Armour Class: 74 (with Owl's Insight and Barkskin)<br/>\n Attack Bonus: +52/+52/+49/+46/+43/+40/+37 (with various buffing spells)<br/>\n Damage: 2d6 + 19 (higher with buffing spells<br/>\n Hit Points: ~ 850 + 100 temporary hit points.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>Note (per Hip): There is a -20% XP penalty on levels 4, 24-26 and 30-40 (total of 15 levels) using this class sequence.</strong></span><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
