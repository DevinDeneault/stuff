YMMV<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter running a bunch of Spellswords/bows 1-40 on WoG with different caster levels and sharing some observations with people who've also run similar builds, I came to realisation that when fighting disabled opponents on a +5 environment, most times (talking lvl 40 numbers) a moderately buffed AB of 40-45 was enough to hit most stuff except bosses.<br/>\nSo anything above final Mundane AB 30 really will be scoring enough hits (assuming +5 from GMW, a moderate +4 from Emp Cat's Grace/items) and with 5 attacks/round (Rapid Shot+Haste) things will be blowing up fast with your Divine empowered arrows.<br/>\nThe glaring weaknesses of the build are obviously the pathetically low HP, saves and AC but these are pretty common with most elven spellbows (prioritize getting some +CON item after getting sufficient +CHA and DEX) and didn't seem as a problem to me while solo playtesting the build 1-36 on WoG obviously with extensive use of Summons and good positioning using Darkness/Improved Invis/Greater Sanctuary.<br/>\nThe things I missed (but not overwhelmingly) were Scribe Scroll as 99% of the times one will have some spells left before resting and Maximize for a bit wider spellbook management, I suppose one could tinker with the feats a bit and get either in place of Extend as 32 rounds is pretty good for most stuff, but I got it to have different duration options on summons mainly.<br/>\nOne could also sub 2 Great CHA for EMA/EW as they are always great to have, but I believe by playing careful when solo or in parties one can get by without them and keep CHA 32 for all the boni when capped at 44 it provides.<br/>\n\u00a0\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>1) Color Spray, Grease, Mage Armor, Protection from Alignment, True Strike\n3) Flame Arrow, GMW, Haste, Stinking Cloud (Negative Energy Burst when Mummy Dust is acquired)\n5) Bigby's Interposing Hand, Firebrand, Hold Monster, Lesser Mind Blank\n7) Bigby's Grasping Hand, Great Thunderclap, Shadow Shield\n9) Mordenkainen's Disjunction, Summon IX, Time Stop\nOther spells to consider while levelling: Darkness, Summon I-VIII/Animate Dead, Isaac's Lesser Missile Storm, Stoneskin/Premonition, Death Armor/Elemental Shield/Mestil's Acid Sheath, Dominate Monster\n</details>\n<br/>\nCheers!<br/>\n<br/>\n<span class=\"inline-attachment\">\n<dl class=\"fileimage display\">\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/202103/10759362_1a9679efeb4eea553cc12b2e44df9941.jpg\" />\n</dl>\n</span><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Divine damage is not limited by the mighty property and is seldom resisted. All this wrapped into one build caught my attention while at the same time looking almost too good.<br/>\nSpellswords/-bows in most (if not all)  cases come at a cost; less caster levels and a lower caster ability stat.<br/>\nWhat must be taken into account are synergies that make such a build stronger and the versatility from different methods of combat that adds to its prowess. <br/>\nThis build has 32 caster levels and a high charisma which makes it a fairly good caster. You also get a high damage bonus on Divine might.<br/>\nI am more concerned about how effective it will be as an archer with the low AB of only 34.<br/>\nIn vanilla NwN the only way you can buff the AB of this archer is with cat's and True strike. TS is powerful but not very practical with its short duration. With capped dex the AB bonus is +40.<br/>\nIf buffing spells and summons work differently on WoG, this build and the play style with buffed summons will potentially be stronger. But if the build is made for playing on WoG, that should be made clear as early as possible.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

When you don't have GMW on bows and Darkfire on arrows, the damage output of this build takes a significant hit. Imagine dealing 1d8 + 5 from Mighty (only if you have 20 STR) + maybe if you're lucky 1d6 from a Fire Arrow, or +5 from a +5 arrow (all of which are finite resources), + 17 Divine per hit. That's numbers before DR or any other considerations. That amounts to a very underwhelming 36 damage per hit AT MAX, half of which can just be resisted with DR. It's just not enough damage without the (VERY GOOD) WoG custom changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Swordflight seems like a good place to do it. It's a challenging environment, especially for a Single Player module.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">+34 base AB is well below the minimum AB I'd accept for this build, but low AB has already been mentioned so I won't focus on that.<br/>\nThe lack of Blind Fight is another problem when using this build, although it's possible that feat isn't needed on WoG.<br/>\nIt's unfortunate that you don't get IC: Longbow since ranged builds need all the damage they can get. However to fit it in you'd probably need to lower your CHA or rearrange your starting abilities.<br/>\nMummy Dust should be moved from level 31 to level 30 since that's when it first becomes available. I assume you replaced Epic Warding and didn't rearrange the feat progression.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm aware that this is a WoG build where animal domain is worth taking, but for vanilla NWN you'd probably be better off with a Sorc32/Pal3/AA5. That would give +17 saves at the cost of -1 damage (and -1 DRed penetration, but in a +5 environment that doesn't matter). Personally I'd prefer a Sorc26/Pal3/AA11 for a spellbow, but that would require lowering caster levels in exchange for better AB and ranged damage.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
