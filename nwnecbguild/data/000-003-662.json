Easy stat spread, can leave DEX and WIS low to pump CHA and STR;<br/>\n2. Fighter provides heavy armour and weapon focus, weapon specialisation at normal and epic levels;<br/>\n3. CoT providers extra feats allowing the easy allocation of Curse Song and Extra Music;<br/>\n4. CoT provides extra universal saves and synergises with a high CHA score for Divine Wrath, Smite Evil and Lay on Hands.<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I missing something here? Or do other combinations just do the above better?</div>"

      "content": "<div>Bard/Figh/CoT isn't a bad idea, it's just that other classes have better synergy with melee bards. CoT10 gives 5 feats, +5 universal saves (which counts towards the saves cap), and Divine Wrath (which is powerful but has a short duration). Smite Evil isn't really powerful enough to be a factor for this build. If you do make one then Bard26/Figh4/CoT10 is a better level layout than Bard24/Figh6/CoT10.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe four main classes melee bards take are BG, Figh, PM, and RDD. BG gives Divine Might, Divine Shield, and Dark Blessing (which doesn't count towards the saves cap), Figh gives more feats, PM gives the usual immunities, RDD gives both ability increases and several immunities.<br/>\n<br/>\nCompare a Bard26/Figh4/CoT10 to a Bard20/BG4/PM16, Bard24/Figh6/PM10, Bard24/Figh6/RDD10,\u00a0Bard26/BG4/PM10 or Bard26/BG4/RDD10. The Bard/Figh/CoT has more feats than any of the other builds, but it lacks immunities and divine feats that the other class combinatons have. Again, that doesn't mean that it's a bad idea, just that there are other builds that usually work better.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hi SnorriHT<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what I would play, based on what you tell me about your environment (dev crit being disabled)<br/>\nYou can tweak it to whatever you would like<br/>\nI like my bards to be difficult to kill with the d6 hit die of the class.\u00a0It makes them one less liability to worry about in parties.<br/>\nHere this guy is only not a liability, he can tank implosions and death magic for the party\u00a0with 400+hp and a fort save of 37(44).<br/>\nI also put spot up nice and high. This is because I find spot more useful than listen, in general.<br/>\nListen is good for detecting enemies through walls and around corners, and helps with invisible enemies (although I find I have to stand next to them to detect them with listen). Unfortunately it gets worse with distance, which the value of detection is to detect them before they detect you.\u00a0<br/>\nSpot allows detection of enemies from a distance as long as they are in eyesight, and also prevents sneak attacks from stealth, which listen does not.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will notice I put lingering song and lasting inspiration into the build, this is because it takes a while to get to lasting inspiration despite me rushing it<br/>\nImproved Disarm is an excellent feat for a bard with curse song (lowering your opponents AC and discipline) and high strength wielding a two handed. It is really fun to use and one can drop some saves feats for this.\u00a0<br/>\nIe drop strong soul and great fortitude for disarm/improved disarm.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaunt is also good, I think you wanted dual detect but you might have to make some compromises and take 43 points out of listen spot or spellcraft to get taunt as well, but I felt with a base AB of 41 + bard/curse song (effective +7AB/7AC) it could be overkill for your environment<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Bard(24), Fighter(6), Champion of Torm(10), Human\nSTR: 16 (30)\nCON: 14\nINT: 14\n\n01: Bard(1): Strong Soul, Luck of Heroes\n03: Bard(2): Lingering Song\n05: Fighter(3)\n07: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization\n09: Champion of Torm(1): Knockdown\n11: Bard(5)\n13: Bard(7)\n15: Champion of Torm(3): Great Fortitude, {Smite Evil}\n17: Bard(10)\n19: Bard(12)\n21: Bard(13): Epic Fortitude\n23: Bard(15)\n25: Bard(16)\n27: Champion of Torm(6): Great Strength I, Epic Weapon Focus, (STR=23)\n29: Bard(19)\n31: Fighter(5)\n33: Bard(21): Great Strength II, (STR=26)\n35: Champion of Torm(8): Armor Skin\n37: Bard(23): Epic Skill Focus: Perform\n39: Champion of Torm(10): Great Strength IV, Epic Prowess, (STR=29)\n\nSkillpoints: 269\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9, Death: +1\nAB (max, naked): 41 (melee), 27 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Bard(6)\n</details>\n<strong>Edit:</strong>\u00a0<br/>\nSorry I forgot still spell, but you can easily fit that in there too, just a product of too much WoG.\u00a0<br/>\nI also don't know enough about smiting to comment, but with only 10 levels of champion of torm I don't believe you should invest in that</div>"
