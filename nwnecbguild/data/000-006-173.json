The problem is that Ambidexterity requires 15 DEX, and taking 7 points from elsewhere to boost DEX to 15 would really hurt this build.<br/>\n That said, it can be done. I think that the feats to drop would be the 2 Disarm feats and Great Fortitude (which would leave you with a still-impressive 39 Fortitude). Dropping starting STR from 19 to 17 would give you 5 points, bringing DEX to 14. The other 2 points should probably come from INT, but that will cost you 43 skill points. You would have to drop Disable Trap, Set Trap, and Search, and lower your UMD by 10, and spend 2 points to raise your Spellcreaft by 1 to compensate for the lost INT. That would leave you with 3 skill points to spend somewhere.</div>",

Plus, I've never played a Half-Orc to conclusion. Thus...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a shame, but I'm biting the bullet on the 20% xp penalty Hip mentions above, as I plan to either be in MTS or SoF by the time it really kicks in, so should still get level 40 with plenty of time to enjoy it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also tweaking slightly. I appreciate there will an AC and crit impact, but I'm thinking greatsword instead of scimitar - shields are for weaklings! Plus the Disarm and Imp Disarm will be working better, as well as increasing damage output. I'm also thinking of messing the skills about a bit: dropping set traps (won't be doing that), spellcraft (the saves are already very good indeed for a meleer), and taking a couple of points from UMD (my understanding from previous discussions is that by and large a modified 33 ranks is fine). Bundling all those up gives me 42 points to almost max Spot or Listen.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo these sound viable?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Just remembered CoT doesn't have Listen as a skill, so it looks like it'd be Spot (ah, rusty, am I).</div>",

In order:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) The xp. Aye, that's what I figured, so I'm happy to soak up the penalty. Part of my wanting to play this dude in the first place was the Half-Orc brutality of it (also one of the reasons I fancied a 2-hander).<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Disarm. Yeah, I suppose now I've bought into the whole KD stuff, it's probably time I had a go at trying out something else. So I'll keep 'em - after all, I won't know what can/can't be disarmed unless I try it, will I? I thought you'd included them primarily for PW play (and Expertise was a giveaway that it was WoG), but I'll give it a go anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) I am indeed playing from level one. Not in Aielund, though, which is Dev Crit disabled. I reckon I now know the OC and SoU/HotU well enough to smash through them with this sweet wee fellow (see portrait in the OP) effectively with just Discipline and Spot as skills. Besides, nothing wrong with a bit of a challenge, eh?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and anyway, I'm already halfway round the Peninsula in Neverwinter (decided to go OC then MTS - as I said, I just want to go around hitting a lot and hard with this one). I've shuffled a few feats around, but kept all of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!</div>",
