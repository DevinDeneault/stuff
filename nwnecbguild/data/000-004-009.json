It is easy to change, so feel free to do so. It boils down to what you want first; better fort saves or more hitpoints.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>1) Adjust your starting stats to DEX 09 - INT 14, put those extra skill points to spellcraft for a neat +2 to all saves Vs spells. In-game you can reach 12 DEX super easily anyway, so better you have the extra skills.</div></blockquote> <br/>\nI am a bit on the fence about this one. Moving a stat point from dex to int gives 23 skill points, and it is normally not that hard to find +3 dex. On the other hand I am not sure if this build really needs +2 to saves vs spells. I already put 8 skillpoints in Heal. X-classing them in spellcraft will give a modified rank of 5 and +1 to saves vs spells. So I could have gone half way already without changing the stats at all.<br/>\nThen again,with more skillpoints I could have x-classed Search for a much improved trap detection. <br/>\nI will leave the Dex 9 - Int 14 route as a tweak to get some extra skillpoints to spend as you please.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

He was concieved when I tested what was possible to do with the fighter class alone with all those feats you get. I immediately realized that 10 levels had to be taken as CoT. That was plain hard core power building, getting that bonus to the saves, more class skills etc. FOR FREE! Well, of course there was a small price, you can't play as evil. But there are plenty of other builds for that. <br/>\nThe father of this build is a lvl 20 build I posted in the old pre epic guild. It was also called Brawler champion. It was  a Fighter 10/CoT 10 build, based on the same ideas as Feat Master. <br/>\nThis build takes things a little further, and has become better than his predecessors.<br/>\nA funny thing is that Feat Master is a dwarf, and the old Brawler champion passed as human. You can spot the dwarven heritage from the high constitution and the low charisma.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You may gain 5 AC but will be missing a lot which gives the enemy more opportunities for cheap crits.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Besides the AC advantage, the Keen property appears more often on slashing weapons than any other damage type.\u00a0 In high-magic environments, you're likely to see Keen appear on totally-unrelated weapons like clubs, staves and spears, but the more realistic content would place greater value on any weapon that does slashing damage and can have its edge honed to unsurpassed sharpness.\n<blockquote><div>You would have more feats.</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">And exactly what feats would those be?\u00a0 Improved Expertise, perhaps?\u00a0 Meh.\u00a0 Maybe Called Shots I suppose.\u00a0 Dunno.

I see that it becomes tight on epic feats with the double weapon focus if I want to retain the high strength. So I don't think I can afford the luxury of going beyond CoT 10. <br/>\nI have to make some tough choices between sticking to\u00a0 the theme of the series, or simplifying things for more focused power.

How about that? <br/>\nYou retain the dual-Wf as per the twenty-levels version but you stick with One as your primary into the thirty levels one,<br/>\nmy reasoning is that until level twenty you have decided/find the best weapon for you &amp; you chose to follow with that into epics.<br/>\nYou still retain the \"basic\" Wf/Ws/Ic/Ep for the secondary weapon anyway, in case you need it ;)<br/>\nAnd of course, the \"full\" level forty version, has dual-focusses all the way. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust my (random) thoughts,<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Maybe either sacrifice Exotic WP or IC on the Flail (as you'll be using that more on non-crit foes)? Even so, it's hard to think of how to get (what would then become) 5 BFs in epic to become 6 (with a F16/M4/CoT10 split)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
