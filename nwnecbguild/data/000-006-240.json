      "content": "<div>Wow! That's the smartest cleric one is likely to see. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know what other build objectives there are here, but, FWIW, a bard 30/cleric 8/rogue 2 gives a slightly higher disable traps total. Using your calculations above, I get set traps of 97 with trickery and bard song. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know about the overall practicality of such dedicated trap-setting builds, but a build with high trap-setting skill (and/or skill mastery) could basically have a store of epic and deadly traps that he sets under opponents' feet right during combat, dealing respectable piercing, elemental, negative, and divine damage while bypassing spell resistance and spellcraft bonuses to saving throws. If one could work in at least one level of HiPS into the mix, that could be an effective tactic against foes without true sight or maxed detect skills...</div>"

      "content": "<div>Other than trying to figure out the highest theoretical DC that can be disabled, this build really achieves little beyond building a typical formidable high-level priest and yet with all those epic levels devoted to INT, casting prowess is sorely diminished (no SpF feats, no penetration feats i.e. 39-58 vs. 45-64 when dealing with high-level monks, clerics, druids).\u00a0 WIS 20 is only \"ok\" for a casting cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\n And Mr. Zork is quite right. Bardic trickery rogues are the highest possible disablers.\u00a0 Work them out for yourself and you will quickly see the light. Dedicated DEXers with SkF + ESkF are the highest possible setters and they ALWAYS need mastery for dueling and mob control.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now to bring up a common mistake made by inexperienced ultra trapper designers... <em>Search</em>.\u00a0 In other words, a toon can't disable a trap it hasn't spotted yet, therefore the final Search competency for this particular build would be:<br/>\n<br/>\n 43(ranks) + 19 INT (am giving the benefit of the doubt when assuming the INT cap can be reached) + 20 (Trickery) + 1 (Prayer) + d20 onheartbeat =<strong> 84-103</strong> (add +2 if elf)<br/>\n<br/>\n The builder also forgot to add the Take 20 to the Disable calculation so I'll list it here for comparison...<br/>\n 43(ranks) + 2 Synergy\u00a0 + 19 INT (am giving the benefit of the doubt when assuming the INT cap can be reached) + 20 (Trickery) + 1 (Prayer) + 13 (focus) + Take20 = <strong>118</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n So, the DC which can be disabled is that DC able to be detected by Search or 84-103.\u00a0 Therefore all skill focus feats are wasted in this example (i.e. 105 will disable all traps which are detected within this build).<br/>\n<br/>\n But what's the point in a build like this anyway?\u00a0 There's not even Skill Mastery to do the disabling during combat (i.e penalize the skill by 1-19 points).\u00a0 The lofty disable values only have merit in PvP\u00a0 (no environments I have ever played have added any more than 10-20 points to default disable DCs for epics. never.) so if this build focuses on dueling another trapper (which is the only reason you'd be encountering DCs higher than Epic 58's in the first place) you'll need to be disabling them faster than he can set them and that won't happen.\u00a0 Since this \"godly\" trapsmith will have lame trapsetting skill and DC, its pedestrian AC rating will fall quickly to range attacks by a vastly-superior DEX-focused Epic Dodge archer trapsetter.<br/>\n<br/>\n Yes. MrZork distilled it down in his first statement:\u00a0 \"Smartest cleric\" around.\u00a0 Just not one that has much common sense when it comes to dealing with traps.\u00a0\u00a0 Sense would have been easy to acquire, too.\u00a0 Just set up a custom module with graduated custom trap DCs and test and test and test some more.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"
