      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi grom,<br/>\n<br/>\n I don't think it a silly question at all. I've just completed my first run-through as an AA (in Aielund), and the hardest thing I found to manage was exactly what you describe. It would have been agonising as a soloist, but chucking a tank in as doorway/corridor blocker made life so much easier. Nonetheless, PBS, Rapid Shot, Imbue and Hail of Arrows I found particularly useful at relatively low levels. In a solo run, I'd think the stealth skills would be particularly helpful in sniping, nipping around the corner and getting into shadows - not that they're much use for the build you're currently playing, I'm afraid. Throwing in a casting of darkness would also help confuse indoor opponents I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, I'm far from an AA expert. Have you read Mick Dagger's excellent Guide to the class? It's in the Game Guides section and very informative it is, too. If you have some time on your hands, you could also have a glance at my <strong>Arcane Archer - A First Stab</strong> thread in the Unfinished Builds / Build Request forum. I'm not blowing my own trumpet here, it includes contributions from those who<strong> do</strong> know what they're talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Sorry, grom - and to be fair, you did say you built on the hoof, but your intention of finishing at AA26/Wiz11/F4 seems to sum to 41 levels...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I'll try to answer as best I can, but please bear in mind \"these views do not necessarily reflect the position of the Guild\". Disclaimer over.<br/>\n<br/>\n On the skills question: that used to bamboozle me, too, but the convention is that the first figure denotes the input into the skill - in this case, just the 1 point - while the one in parenthesis shows the nett result, in this case, and with a -1 WIS, that means 0. Again, for this particular example a single inputted point in any skill is really neither here nor there, so I whacked it in Heal, otherwise I'd be left with a spare point and I don't like danglers much.<br/>\n<br/>\n On the Wizard issue, it's quite simple. I don't do arcanists (a mixture of personal preference and lack of experience), so initially I only wanted a single Wiz level - just to qualify for AA: the second A being of greater importance to me. Not once did I cast a single spell while playing up to level 37. I ended up taking 2 levels for +1 BAB. That's because you can only take a max of 10 levels of AA pre-epic, so would initially have been left with 9 levels of Monk and 1 of Wiz. Monk is a 3/4 BAB class and Wiz a 1/2 class: which meant I'd have a BAB of 10 (AA) + 6 (Monk) + 0 (Wiz) = 16 pre-epic. Taking the second level of Wiz and dropping one of Monk gave the result of BAB 10 (AA) +6 (Monk) +1 (Wiz) = 17, thus a better chance to actually hit my target.<br/>\n<br/>\n On reflection, I think I'd take Rogue instead of Monk myself, but Monk is my single favourite class, so when constructing that build - which was me venturing into unknown territory (should really have called it \"First Shot\", I suppose) - I reverted to a class I was comfortable with. I would have gone with Bard instead of Wizard (I tend not to regard Bardsong as \"true\" arcanism) except for two things. First, Bard is a non-Lawful class, while Monk has to be Lawful. Second, I was playing as an elf, which has Wiz as its favoured class, so I'd attract an xp penalty by taking Bard. That matters less in a PW - where you can nullify the effect by having respawning foes popping up constantly - than it does in module play, where you can't, and it can actually set you back a couple of levels or more.<br/>\n<br/>\n There you go - hope this makes sense!<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Sorry, meant to mention, Empyre posted his Persuasive Archer build within the First Stab thread, and that's a Rogue/AA/Wiz build which might appeal to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></em> Have just been having a browse through some earlier and diverse discussions on this 'ere forum (having a quiet Sunday), and what do I find?
