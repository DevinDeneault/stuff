the game.<br/>\nAfter noticing an issue with Damage Reduction while testing polymorph, I've done some testing with DRed and noticed a few bugs.<br/>\nI plan to inform Beamdog of the bugs but I'm posting here to inform players about potential issues with DRed.<br/>\nAlthough it doesn't affect builds directly it is important when gearing characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two ways to add Damage Reduction (excluding feats), via effect and via item property.<br/>\nDamage Reduction effects are mainly gained via spells (Epic Warding, Ghostly Visage, Stoneskin, etc.)<br/>\nDamage Reduction item properties are gained via items, although this also applies to polymorphed players since some forms have Damage Reduction on their creature items.<br/>\n<br/>\nDamage Reduction is important for reducing damage (obviously) and for penetrating Damage Reduction when using a creature weapon.<br/>\n10/+5 DRed blocks 10 physical damage from weapons with a +0 to +4 AB/EB bonus, but will not block any damage from weapons with a +5 AB/EB bonus or higher.<br/>\nHaving 10/+5 DRed and attacking with creature weapons will penetrate X/+5 DRed or lower, but will not penetrate X/+6 DRed or higher.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe testing I did was with effect Damage Reduction (EFDR) and item property Damage Reduction (IPDR).<br/>\nI tested how EFDR and IPDR actually work with regards to reducing damage (DR) and penetrating Damage Reduction (CW DRPen).<br/>\nThere were six test categories: AB vs EFDR, AB vs IPDR, EFDR CW DRPen vs EFDR, EFDR CW DRPen vs IPDR, IPDR CW DRPen vs EFDR, IPDR CW DRPen vs IPDR.<br/>\nI didn't test all possible combinations within those categories, I only tested for the thresholds, so it's possible that there are further bugs with DRed.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Effect DRed\nX DAMAGE_POWER_NORMAL EFDR is actually X/+0 DR.\n\nX/+8 IPDR is actually X/+7 DR.\nX/+10 IPDR is actually X/+9 DR.\nX/+12 IPDR is actually

CW DRPen.\nX/+17 EFDR is actually X/+18 DR for CW DRPen.\nX/+19 EFDR is actually X/+20 DR for CW DRPen.\nX DAMAGE_POWER_ENERGY EFDR is actually X/+6 DR for CW DRPen.\nCreature Weapon Item Property
