More!\" the crowd roared and tankards clanked in appreciation. A slight woman with dark red hair took a deep breath and bowed with infinite grace atop the small stage. Everyone knew she was not some traveling vagabond with a tale or two to entertain but a real performer from the city that had come by chance to stay in their humble inn for the evening. The room was entranced by her lilting voice and the plucking of her fine gilded Pixie Harp. They would not see her like again for many years in this town. The cheers continued.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thick wooden door crashed open letting in the bitter winter air. The room turned at the intrusion. It was Badge and his smelly crew. Some turned away, the mood ruined by the appearance of the local hoodlums; others dared a hateful look.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Wot's this? A bit of silk eh? Come darlin' lets have a ditty\" Badge snarled at the tiny singer; his men pushing forward toppling drinks and tables. Their smell of homemade barrel ale drifted through the room. Badge moved close enough to the singer to grip her leg with a callused hand tipped with greasy nails. \"Let's 'ave a ditty.\" His voice was slurred and his eyes bloodshot. The grip tightened.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe singer smiled. A vastly disarming smile that lit the room from wall to wall. \"Well sir, let me play you something special.\" With practiced movements she began to strum a single cord on her harp. Her voice lifted into the musky air of the tiny inn.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone could remember what followed and none ever knew what happened to Badge and his men for they were never seen again.<br/>\n<br/>\nHail the Troubadour Guardian, a strange personality rarely seen in the Realms. She combines arcane magic, divine blessings, and inspiring music into a formidable fighting machine.<br/>\n<br/>\nBard(35), Paladin(4), Pale Master(1), Human, True Neutral vs. smite* (Lawful

Comments by Author</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nEquipment<br/>\nFull Plate (or robes)<br/>\nRapier<br/>\nTower Shield <br/>\n<br/>\nTroubadour Guardian Advantages<br/>\nHigh AC<br/>\nNumerous buffing abilities<br/>\nHigh saving throws<br/>\nReasonable spellcasting capability<br/>\nGood skill rolls due to Bard Song<br/>\nReduces opponent's skill rolls with Curse Song<br/>\n<br/>\nTroubadour Guardian Disadvantages<br/>\nMediocre hit points<br/>\nIneffective against characters who possess high AC, such as monks, rogues, assassins, pale masters, dragon disciples, epic wizards and sorcerers, and other paladins<br/>\nWeak against rogues and assassins, who can sneak up on her<br/>\nWeak spell DC and spell penetration<br/>\n<br/>\nSaving throws are decent as the Troubadour Guardian is blessed with a +13 bonus from Divine Grace.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Troubadour Guardian has no access to any Paladin spells, but has a vast array of Bardic spells:<br/>\nLevel 0: All cantrips<br/>\nLevel 1: Mage Armor, Grease, Balagarn's Iron Horn, Charm Person, Cure Light Wounds<br/>\nLevel 2: Bull's Strength, Eagle's Splendor, Darkness, Ultravision, Cloud of Bewilderment<br/>\nLevel 3: Haste, Keen Edge, Greater Magic Weapon, Confusion, Wounding Whispers<br/>\nLevel 4: Cure Critical Wounds, Hold Monster, Dismissal, War Cry, Improved Invisibility<br/>\nLevel 5: Ethereal Visage, Greater Dispelling, Healing Circle, Mind Fog, Summon Creature V<br/>\nLevel 6: Dirge, Energy Buffer, Ice Storm, Mass Haste, Summon Creature VI<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most important spells are the buffing spells such as Bull's Strength, Eagle's Splendor, Mage Armor, Haste, Keen Edge, Greater Magic Weapon, War Cry, Improved Invisibility, Energy Buffer, and Wounding Whispers.<br/>\n<br/>\nTurn Undead: She has 8 uses of Turn Undead per day. The Turn Undead power itself is extremely weak for this character, but the Turn Undead charges can be used for any of the below abilities as well:<br/>\n<br/>\nDivine Might: +13 Divine Damage for 13 rounds (14-15 damage and rounds if buffed)<br/>\nDivine Shield: +13 Dodge AC for 13 rounds (14-15 AC and rounds if buffed)<br/>\nDivine Damage: This type of damage is rarely resisted by enemies, so it is very helpful when dealing with enemies that have large amounts of damage reduction<br/>\nDivine Shield: Divine Shield offers a huge AC boost and can be a life saver when swamped by enemies and while performing spellcasting<br/>\nSmite Evil: Once each day the character can use Smite Evil: +13 (+14-15 if buffed) to attack, though only a measly +4 damage; still, it is useful for providing a single accurate blow to an opponent<br/>\nLay On Hands: Once per day, the Troubadour Guardian can use Lay On Hands to channel 13 X 4 = 52 (56 or 60 if buffed) points of Positive energy that can be used for healing (making it just as good as the Heal spell) or for attacking an undead creature with a low touch AC that is susceptible to Positive energy; it isn't much, but it's still something<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Troubadour Guardian is a master of scoring criticals, with a 30% chance per hit, or 45% if her rapier is buffed with Keen Edge! This can vastly increase her damage potential, hitting up to 2 times her normal damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably her most significant ability is her Bardic music. With a Level 35 Bard Song and a modified 56 Perform, she can provide 30 temporary hit points, +7 to skill rolls, +5 AC, + 2 Fortitude, +2 Reflex, +3 Will, +2 Attack, and +3 Damage to all nearby allies, or cause the opposite on enemies. Her song lasts 5 Hours.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Troubadour Guardian has two different strategies in fighting.<br/>\nIf she has the element of surprise, she should cast buffing spells somewhere safe, while unarmored, and then wear her full battle gear and pounce upon her enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf she is ambushed, she can cast Still spells, while having the Improved Expertise Combat mode activated.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Troubadour Guardian probably doesn't have to worry too much about getting hit once fully buffed, as she can reach up to 58 AC without any magical items. As for her attack bonus, she can have up to +39/+34/+29/+24 without any magical items. And let's not forget her saving throws, which can reach up to a decent 36 Fortitude, 38 Reflex, and 39 Will, without any magical items.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis character is even more powerful when she has access to magical equipment. The number one focus should be on items that boost Charisma. Every increase to the Charisma bonus results in improvements to:<br/>\n<br/>\nDivine Grace saving throw bonus<br/>\nDivine Might damage bonus and duration<br/>\nDivine Shield AC bonus and duration<br/>\nSmite Evil attack bonus <br/>\nLay on Hands magnitude<br/>\nTurn Undead uses per day<br/>\nBard Song &amp; Curse Song magnitude<br/>\n<br/>\nEquipment Wishlist<br/>\nItems that would be very useful would be Holy Avenger, Epic Gloves of the Minstrel, Rings of Protection, Amulets of Natural Armor, Magic Armor and Shields (preferably ones with reduced arcane spell failure), a Belt of Giant Strength or Belt of Agility, and perhaps Boots of Striding. Also, the Lich Lyrics is a must-have item.</div>"
