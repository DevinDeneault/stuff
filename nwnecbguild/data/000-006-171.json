      "content": "<div>Hey man!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I appreciate what you tried here, I have to say that this build is way too flawed to be any good in a seriously challenging environment. There are a few things that IMO you could improve on it without breaking the concept, and which would make it WAY better.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst thing that jumps out is that you have literally NOTHING to compensate for the low AB this guy will have due to his low STR, and you do have the means to have better AB just by making the most of your Paladin buffs, which cap at 15th level. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what I suggest you could do is the following: RADICALLY change the final spread, which would basically transfer your bonus feats from pre-epic into post-epic. Get 14 WIS to be able to cast 4th level spells. I'd go with Paladin 26 Fighter 4 CoT 10 (Paladin 16 / Fighter 4 or 15 / 4 / 1 for slightly higher saves pre-epic) and stop CHA at 26, putting the remaining 4 points into STR for a higher AB. That would lower your saves, but TBH, with as many Pally levels and such high CHA, it's not a major loss. DM / DS will still work great with 14 rounds duration if you cap your CHA with gear / spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat this would do for you is give you an extra epic feat, since CoTs only give 1 feat every 4 levels after 10, but they give 1 feat every 2 levels until 10 and you can push these levels all into epic, and gain another 2 bonus feats from Paladin 26, which amount to 7 bonus feats in epics, where you currently have 6. You'd also have indispellable capped buffs and some nice immunities, like Death Ward and Freedom. (Not to mention Holy Sword).<br/>\n<br/>\nJust this would make your build overall much stronger without altering the concept.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>",

      "content": "<div>Max, the concept of the build was not the modern Paladin-heavy but the older &amp; classic \"Divine Warrior\" thus the heavy investment on CoT. IMO Pelagius build is better in every aspect compared to the original, so at least on that he succeeded. It is also not true that he does not have anything to raise his effective AB figures since he has both his great smites X3 &amp; the divine wrath ability that gives him a great boost to his fighting abilities while it lasts (and it lasts quite a bit due to the high Charisma). Not to forget also, his powerful 53 (59) taunt skill that can reduce the opponents AC by six whole points should he use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the legacy build for you to compare =&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/divine-warrior-paladin-6-fighter-8-champion-of-tor-t515463.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">divine-warrior-paladin-6-fighter-8-cham ... 15463.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTo be clear, I am not saying that you were wrong in your constructive feedback but rather that you missed the point of this build. All your marks are quite on point and yes your \"Aribeth\"\u00a0 build, for example, are quite a lot more powerful probably than this one, but they are indeed different concepts and builds after all. Besides, there is something relaxing having over 1 &amp; 1/2 real minutes for each use of your divine might/ shield/ wrath uses. ;)</div>"

      "content": "<div>Ok, then. If the concept is different, at least do yourself a little favor and stop CHA at 26, then you can raise your AB by 2. Without spells, this guy's stats look awfully underwhelming. But OK, if investing in CoT was the point of the build, then at least you can get 18 STR without losing any real stats. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I'd take Expertise at level 1. That's the problem of playing in places where you don't get hit as often. You undervalue some REALLY cool feats like Expertise, and overvalue other not so useful ones like Cleave. I know what I'm talking about because I've been there and done that. I used to think Cleave was amazing and all my fighters got it at level 1, and I would NEVER get Expertise. After all, why bother with extra AC when you're wielding a 2-handed, are surrounded, and you're still not getting hit, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEnviado do meu iPhone usando Tapatalk</div>",

      "content": "<div>Well, thanks for the comments and critiques. Max is most probaly right on everything he said, however, you have to consider it was my first seriously thoughtout build, and as such I wasn't expecting it to be the end-all be-all of paladin/CoT based builds. Still, I'm porud of it (and grateful for the help I received) in the way a kid might be proud of his first finished painting. But again, I consider this build finished as is. Of course, I would welcome any discussion about it, but I'm not working on it anymore. I think it's time to move to something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want, Max, you can check the original thread <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/my-first-half-decent-build-fighter-4-paladin-12-ch-t2354715.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm still learning the ropes of proper character building. And sinc I enjoy playing paladin types I think I'm gonna sort of focus on that. I'm currently going through Crimson tides of Thetyr with a similar but less smite-focused build. I'll write down the heavy paladin build suggestion Max posted for another module, since I've been also tinkering with a build concept focused more on paladin leveles and less CoT. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as always thanks, guys, there's so much I still have to learn and it is unvaluable to have people like you guys around.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!</div>"
