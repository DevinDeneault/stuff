      "content": "<div>Hello All,<br/>\n<br/>\n About a year ago, on my first ever thread, several of us shared screenshots of our various creations - sometimes elegantly posed, sometimes action shots, some glamour (though, to be fair, not much evidence of glamour). This gave some some substance to our virtual creations, showed their development, and gave an idea of where they were playing (if you get what I mean), but more importantly, it was fun (\"Behold my surging prowess, weakling!\", \"Be staggered at her mighty tusks!\" sort of thing).<br/>\n<br/>\n Maybe it's something others would be interested in?<br/>\n<br/>\n I am now confronted with two challenges: i) Establish a link to that thread, so you can see what I mean (feel free to ignore the first few pages, where I merely blather on about the actual build request). I'll try that shortly. And ii) Find where the hell the screenshot button is on my new keyboard, 'cos it sure ain't where it used to be.<br/>\n<br/>\n For the uninitiated in these things (and me, who's only done two, and those a year ago), here's the sequence for posting a screenshot:<br/>\n<br/>\n 1. Press the Print Screen button - normally near F12 on the keyboard (ooh, just found mine!). You create a bmp screenshot at the same name's folder in the NWN1 folder.<br/>\n<br/>\n 2. Upload to a free web-hosting site - Photobucket or IMGUR (I remember using IMGUR, which was surprisingly easy for an old Luddite).<br/>\n<br/>\n 3. Copy the Direct Link of your pic there and paste on the thread.<br/>\n<br/>\n I also wrote another note, which reads: \"TGA viewer - Fast Stone Image Viewer - change them to png format, which imgur supports.\" Unfortunately, I have no recollection of what that means, or does. Sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n Right, let's try that link... <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2354345/Nonshooty-nonmagicky-elves-you-know-youre-out-there#.VuMvM0DOEqg\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/23 ... uMvM0DOEqg</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Bugger me, the link works! It does, however, seem ludicrously long. Is there a way of shortcutting these things?</div>",

This one's from part 2 of Aielund, and features one of Empyre's builds - Order of the Wyrm (unarmed version).

At least, he did until I screwed something up in Trinity, and now the king won't talk to me. Still haven't figured out why, but doesn't stop the build being great (merely the player).<br/>\n<br/>\n Hope you've had a good time with Doom.

Then my toon will begin controlling the situation, maybe splitting or immobilizing a few of the mob.\u00a0 After it appears the main body is managed, switch the hench to attack nearest.\u00a0 Tomi usually gets a few easy sneaks in on those I've tied up. \u00a0 I've yet to lose a single OC hench that way.\u00a0 But without Tony's AI, Boddyknock is still more of a liability than a valuable companion.\u00a0 In my experience, Grimgnaw, once permahasted with cold attack and all his monk goodies seems to dominate most encounters.<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and keep dropping Fox pots on Tomi until you get him to at least +2 to disable/search.\u00a0 I don't recall your final build atm (I seem to remember you using bard mainly as a dump class?), but with Empower and Bard 10+, improving INT skills is even easier.\u00a0 You may be surprised how many times Tomi is just a point or 2 away from disarming those \"problem\" traps, typically electrical or fire.</div></div>"

Currently I'm also playing the plague campaign with a barb, and using Tomi as henchman. I ordered him to use his bow, and in battles I try to draw all the enemies on me (I have over 200 hp at lvl 14, so I can take the hits). If he is out of sneak range, I just order him to follow, and when he is close enough I order him to attack. He can do 20-30 dmg with sneaks at this level.\u00a0This way Tomi can use his sneak in safety, and I have a lock/trap specialist. Well to be honest I don't really need him now, because the traps cant kill me, and I can smash all the crates and doors with my axe... but the sneak damage is impressive, so I stick with him.</div>"

Therefore, no moss cloak yet. But I remember asking you about warhammers in MTS, and I came up with a couple from Khor's Quartermaster en route to his lair. One is the Hammer of Destruction: AB+4, +1d8 acid, dispel magic on hit (DC 14); the other is the Hammer of Creation: AB+4, +1d8 electricity, haste. Thought you might like to know for your records!<br/>\n<br/>\nOff to Zael now. Dwarven Wall/Panzer doing v nicely so far (a bit crappy against the Rakshasa mobs, though - wasn't killing 'em fast enough to stop the enormous amounts of magic flooding my way, even with a deep HP pool. But we got there in the end).</div>",

For anyone less well-versed, the original couple of posts of this thread deal with the technicalities and - almost unbelievably - they're from me!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the OC, I can't think of any point where you'd <em>need</em> a henchie, but you might take one for colour and gifts. Tomi's useful as a lock-opener and de-trapper in your early days, and Linu's handy for healing stuff. Daelan's good if you're made of glass and don't do front line stuff. But no one's necessary, particularly as their AI is abominable. I don't know what your main weapon is (unless it really is sling), but if you can grab either a scimitar or greatsword +1 and add some adamantium (iirc) at Marok's forge, that'll give you fire damage, so locks will no longer present a problem. There are only 2 lumps of the stuff lying around - one in No-Man's Land on the way to Blacklake, and the other in Blacklake while undertaking a bit of art theft (so you can use the 2nd to upgrade further in chapter 3). I confess that I tend to do the prison/peninsula first, then No-Man's and Blacklake, because they're my least favourites, so I get the upgrades nice and early. Then I head for the Beggars' Nest and finally the Docks 'cause they're both fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou probably know all this already, but I'm bored, so thought I'd share!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

Great plot with bucket-loads of twists and turns, lots of action, excellent companions (the AI is SO much better), and gets you from level 1 to at least 36 (though 37 is certainly do-able, and Mick's recently been showing off about hitting level 38, but he soloed it, so missed out on some flavour, to my mind). There are a few changes from vanilla (all detailed on page 13 - I think - of the Aielund thread), including no Dev-Crit, but nothing radical. I can't recommend it highly enough. You won't ever regret playing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!</div>",

Apologies for a late reply.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Lead an army in an epic battle between good and evil, with up to a hundred soldiers on either side!<br/>\n<br/>\nGive orders to your troops, summon reinforcements, and deploy artillery to support them, as your army strives to capture the enemy's shrines, smash down the gates of their fortress and destroy their altar.<br/>\n<br/>\nWage war against the computer, or take the battle online and fight alongside (or against!) your friends. Join either side, as a General or a Hero, with six armies to lead, and eight battlefields to fight over.\"\u00a0 (Vault blurb)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, it's not an adventure with a story, but a Real Time Strategy game. You have an Altar that must survive and the enemy has one you must destroy. You both have a number of shrines which generate mana, and mana is spent spawning your army, buying seige weapons and casting a limited number of healing spells. You can let the AI run your army or you can be the General, deciding which troops to spawn, giving them orders to attack a target, guard your shrines or strategic choke points, or simply come with you as you lead an attack force. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you aren't a PW player it's a great way to keep your characters alive after their module finishes and even at lvl40 (Tho it does become a case of can you survive dev crit @ lvl40 (so fortification on items is a good idea), and I used it a lot as a place to create a character I had built in excel as I got into learning how (and lurking here for ages ofc ;) ). When you build a character with an impressive spell or special ability DC, you want to use it a lot, no? Bard song and mass buffs from casters come into their own when you're able to influence so many troops. With the exception of the social skills, everything can be useful. I even have an effective Harper Scout there. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe author, John 'Gestalt' Bye, actively encourages modding it and provides a step by step guide to building your own maps etc. I wanted to make it less about dev crit and make it even more about your character and what they can do at high levels so started modding the armies and abilities and making new maps etc, and ended up making all sorts of changes. So the screenies I posted are from my version. I'll take some when in a battle and post them. <br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/module/good-vs-evil-iii\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://neverwintervault.org/project/nw ... s-evil-iii</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun :)</div>"

I guess you didnt play online PvP game modes in other games like king of the Hill or Capture The Flag?\u00a0 (This is exactly like Unreal Tiurnament 2004 Onslaught mode on the off chance?)\u00a0 Or maybe you did and I just dont like the god element of Civ in your reply?\u00a0 It is essentially about controlling territory like civ but none of the research, faith etc.. that's the DnD character build bit. <br/>\n<br/>\nThing is, the difference with NWN and DnD is that you generally dont get 4-6 ish people playing together as the original DnD was conceived, (even in PWs IME, (Once we got 8 of us in a quest party and ofc there were DM events where lots would meet up, but playing GvE with friends was the only other time I got 8 people playing together.)\u00a0 (tho I never tried slow levelling, full RP, no OOC chat servers. Not my thing. Maybe it works there.) Anyway, a healer build, for example, is a weak choice in a party of you and a henchie or a couple of friends .. but in the context of an army at war, you can make a significant difference. Many RP builds are weak choices, yet can be incredible in that war context (If you go where you are needed to support, attack, defend etc). <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, it could be a great place to experiment with a caster build.. you know, if you were an out and out meleer and wanted a nice environment to learn how to fight with one *Cheeky grin* (Sorry, but as a caster, how can I not join in the 'get Stag to play a caster' campaign? *grin*) <br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun :)<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Modding things only breaks other things, lol. The economy in mine is a joke, some troops spawn naked and OMG trying to rename everything to make an easy hak download compatible with CEP drove me so insane I burnt out.
