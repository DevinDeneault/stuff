      "content": "<div>Ending with an odd ability score is a big no if it can be avoided in my book. I also do not get why you are pumping Str at all. I'd start with Dex 17, Con 14 and then pump only Dex up to 22. AC and AB will both benefit. As an halfling your thrown weapons will hit at the same AB as kukris. I'd also go with daggers vs kukris and skip the IC feat. That would free up 2 feat slots for PBS/RS. I see you are missing BF, it could be put in instead of LoH. If you are really concerned by the will save (which can be covered through UMD/gear usually) I'd look into getting Iron Will instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nLore is kinda wasted points, especially since you have no disable traps nor search or OL. Your set trap is even too high, a 15 modified score (25 for gas traps) is all you need. If you drop lore for disable trap you'll also benefit from the synergy bonus btw. I'd consider going without discipline depending on the playing environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nNice idea recreating OotS characters btw. Well done.</div>"

      "content": "<div>TBH, I would use only 1 level of barb to retain the roleplay aspect of the class selection and to keep rage.  Uncanny Dodge you will get with assassin anyway so there is nothing to lose but 2HP if you swap it for ranger.  I'd get that 10th level of ranger for the additional FE, especially seeing as how it is a typical, low damage dexer build.  And that additional level will help the duration of ranger spells that will not be extended.  Therefore, my choice would be Rgr10/Barb1/Assn9.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, one other thing...  shouldn't your Will save increase by 2 (to 11) from Iron Will?  With all the class swapping, the unmodified Will save shouldn't change because none of the classes used have Will as a primary save.  (I'm surprised Kamiryn's spreadsheet didn't calculate the increase. ?!?! )  Or have you somehow dropped Wisdom down when you changed the abilities around?   Strange.</div>"

Is there any more oots builds somewhere?<br/>\n 2. How would you change the build if I just want to use daggers instead of kukris? What extra feat would you take? Imp. crit? A keen dagger with imp.crit is almost the same as a keen kukri without the feat. Another save boost? Expertise? Or something else?<br/>\n<br/>\n P.S. The will saves are correct in both builds, the original has luck of heroes instead of iron will :)</div>"
