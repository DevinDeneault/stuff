      "content": "<div>Hail, Mighty ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\nI come to you today to proudly present the most recent result of a collaborative effort that Stagmeister and I have been undertaking, to try to make NWN builds for Baldur's Gate NPCs. Since last time, we've had a new addition to the team. Mr. Mick Dagger is lending us his expert advice, which came in the form of a tweak to this build in particular. The interesting part (and cool as hell if I may say so), is that I had already built Kivan myself, but I asked Stag to do it as well, and he came up with a build that had EXACTLY the same class split than mine. It was slightly different, but we tweaked a few things here and there, and then Mick pointed out that Kivan also had high STR in the BG game, so we reduced his Dexterity a bit, leaving him still with a very respectable 53 ranged AB, but able to do a bit more damage with his bows and 14 STR.<br/>\n<br/>\nKivan was an archer who was captured with his wife by the half-ogre bandit leader Tazok. He managed to escape, but his wife wasn't so lucky, and died at the hands of the bandits. When you meet him, he seeks to avenge her death by killing Tazok, and will join the party permanently if you assist him in this mission. He doesn't talk too much, nor does he have remarkable personality traits, other than disliking Evil characters and people who talk too much. He was a Ranger and is holding a bow in his portrait, so he wasn't at all a complicated build to come up with. Since he could also fight in melee in BG, we gave him Weapon Finesse to represent that ability in NWN, but he'll certainly be way more effective from afar.<br/>\n<br/>\nLadies and Gentlemen,

like to point out that Blinding Speed was chosen for the coolness factor. Obviously if Perma-Haste is easily available, it becomes redundant. In that case, you can take Epic Prowess there, and use the Ranger Bonus Feat at level 40 to take an extra Favored Enemy if you'd like.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>",
