However the alternatives are changing fighter to CoT (bad idea for this build in my opinion, as he will have very low damage without WS and EWS), or changing the race to human or dwarf, which means either dropping 1 point of AB because of the lower dexterity (I don't like this option as the build only has the standard 40 AB as it is, though unarmed monk attack progression helps with that), or spending two more epic feats on stat increases, thus lowering the stunning fist DC to 36, which kinda defeats the point of being a stunner monk in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish I could squeeze more improved stunning fist feats into it, to get to a really ridiculous DC, however I'd have to either get more fighter levels, dropping important class features from monk and/or SD, start with a higher dexterity or wisdom, nerfing my strength and constitution to death in the process, or accept a lower AB (but you do need to hit your target for the stunning fist DC to even matter...). I'm wondering about how a totally dedicated stunner build like a Monk/fighter/CoT would fare. Such a build would lose HIPS, epic dodge and uncanny dodge, but would be able to spend 4 more feats on improved stunning fist, for a DC of 48...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

So against undeads and constructs, it is useless, but the same can be said about a rogue's sneak attacks or a WM's critical hits.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince this build has perfect self, boosting will saves is not that appealing, so the real draw to an increased wisdom is the AC.<br/>\nIn fact, I did consider doing what you suggest hunearo, and even thought about dropping another improved stunning fist for armor skin, but doing this would mean I end up with just one improved stunning fist feat, and a DC of 37, which is not that great against melee (for me, the appeal of a stunner build is to be able to use SF effectively against any type of opponent that isn't immune to it). So at that point I would question even going for improved SF in the first place, considering it's costing me two points of AB (I could easily go for 34 DEX without it).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Improved knockdown is good, but not nearly as good as a very high DC stunning fist in my opinion (well, except when facing crit immune foes of course), for several reasons:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Knockdown only lasts one round, vs 3 for stunning fist<br/>\n2. As a monk, you're likely to have lowish AB, which makes it difficult to use KD successfully on anything that has a good discipline, whereas with improved stunning fist feats, you can achieve such high DCs that even meleers will have trouble making the save<br/>\n3. Speaking of AB, KD gives you a -4 penalty, whereas for a monk, SF has no penalty (if using a non-monk build though, you do get a -4 penalty, and it could be argued that going for improved SF worsens your AB since you need 19 wisdom for it, and you're investing epic feats in it, which could be spent into Great Dex instead)<br/>\n4. You can't knockdown an already knocked down target to reset the duration of the prone status, whereas you can use stunning fist on an already stunned opponent to reset the duration of the stun, making it possible to stunlock tough opponents to death.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut of course, the limited uses per day, and the fact that it doesn't work against crit immune opponents are big limitations.<br/>\nPersonnally, I find it best to use SF either from stealth or on a knocked down opponent (well, on a flatfooted opponent really). Since you only have a limited amount of SF per day, it's better to make sure that they have as much chance of landing as possible by denying your opponent his dodge AC bonuses.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do realize though that dedicated stunner builds are pretty rare in PvM, probably for good reasons. You do sacrifice a lot to get that high DC stunning fist. And you have to be dex based since ISF has 19 DEX as requirement, so, without sneak attack, it can be difficult to actually finish off stunned foes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat shadowboxer build does seem like it could be quite effective in PVP, though I'd still play something a bit more versatile instead. But I appreciate it.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
