      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Inspired by <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build300792.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this spell-blade build</a>, I set out to make a spellsword on Arelith (Server-specific information has been collated <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=184\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>). Meaning I had to turn a level 40 build into a level 30 build.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few main issues: 1) I have to take a minimum of 10 Sorc levels pre-epic with this spread, and if I take the absolute minimum, I can't take any CoT levels later to up Discipline (EDIT: plus, it would only net me 1 AB, and I wouldn't get the bonus feat post-epic). 2) Auto-still spell is nigh-impossible to get because you can't the first rank in it until Sorc 18 (for 9th level spells). 3) Weapon buffing spells are unstackable (GMW, Darkfire, etc), any Bigby's spell without a save now has a Reflex save, and Death Armor / Acid Sheath / Ele Shield don't stack.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe server does have some advantages for the build, however: 1) Very low-magic server; items with +2 to a stat are very, very rare, so your spells (True Strike, Haste, etc) can't simply be replaced with insane items, and you're unlikely to hit the +12 ability cap. 2) Taking Spell Focus feats (which all casters can do) gives you extra goodies. I took Abjuration, partly for RP reasons, which nets me a Mass Hold Person \"spell\" and +6 on dispel checks (the existence of this +6 to dispel is why I didn't put a great effort in becoming \"undispellable\"). 3) At the end of the day, it's an RP server. People collaborate, people roll up purposely unoptimized characters, and losing a fight just gives you something else to RP. I'm not trying to powergame with this build; I'm trying to flesh out a character concept.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm playing this character already, at level 5 (4 sorc 1 fighter), which has caused me a bit of aggravation in deciding where to go from here.

Nothing in stone.</div></blockquote>\n\nYou're right about delaying ewf and ep; I was playing around with a bunch of feats and didn't optimize the order of feat selection.<br/>\n<br/>\n6 levels of CoT gives +3 to saves, 5fort/5ref/2will, Divine Wrath, and 3 bonus feats.<br/>\n<br/>\n6 levels of Paladin (just comparing 6 for 6) gives CHA to saves (3 unbuffed, possibly 4 or 5 with buffs / items), 5fort/2ref/2will, Turn Undead, Remove Disease, and immunity to fear / disease. Also access to level 1 spells, most of which I already have, but Bless Weapon IS stackable with other weapon buffing spells on Arelith. Actually, I'm not sure if the enhancement buff will stack, but the damage to undead will. So I'd lose 3 Reflex from the class, and 2 more from dropping Lightning Reflexes. Additionally, I would lose the 3 feats and also either spend 3 more feats on Power attack / Div Might / Div shield or completely ignore them. And I'd have to take a 5th level of Fighter in epic, meaning either Paladin 5 (losing 1 to all saves) or Sorc 19 (weaker spells, more dispellable buffs, -1 to Will saves, -1 Level 9 spell known, -2 Level 9 spells per day)<br/>\n<br/>\nLosing Skill Focus: Conc would probably be ideal; I already took it in-game, however (and kicked myself for it--though I haven't had a spell interrupted yet...)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

At that point, I've got 4 feat slots (2 gen, 2 CoT bonus feats) to slot in 3 Auto-stills, Epic Weapon Spec, and Epic Spell Focus (which is a core part of the character).
