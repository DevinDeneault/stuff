I have no idea about Wizards or Pale Masters (DwDs, I know, for what it's worth!), and only a passing knowledge of Arelith, so this is really just a welcome until someone who knows what they're talking about comes along...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, welcome!</div>",

      "content": "<div>Welcome and well met!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo,<br/>\nArelith is a very customised persistent world and, like many such modules, there is a basic framework upon which everything else sits.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Arelith DR builds are far outstripped by Critical hits (200+ is not uncommon).  The one way to mitigate this is by being immune critical.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is, there are not many immune critical builds that do not destroy your character mechanics.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou are stuck between a bit of a rock and hard place here.  You will not be an effective caster, buffer or melee character.  Although your caster level will be 16 for the purposes of dispels, you actual spell level will be lower.  Your casting level will be 11 netting you 6th level spells.  You would be much better off not casting any spells and buffing from scrolls/wands to keep near undispellable mundane casting (character level).<br/>\n<br/>\nI do a lot of the Arelith wiki work/contributions and I created/maintain a build index (see below) and I also created some dispel tables which will help outline what this means.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.nwnarelith.com/Dispel_Tables\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://wiki.nwnarelith.com/Dispel_Tables</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see with 16 CL for dispel purposes, each of your spells will have a 75-95% chance of being dispelled depending on how much abjuration foci the dispel caster has.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI would suggest you take a look here for build ideas:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.nwnarelith.com/Character_Builds\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://wiki.nwnarelith.com/Character_Builds</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few semi viable DR builds:<br/>\nHexblade 6 / Earthkin defender 14 / PM 10 as a melee build<br/>\nBarbarian 16 / Hexblade 4 / PM 10 as a melee build (go HOrc for racial DI)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlternatively, <br/>\nWizard 11 / PM 16 / 3 bard is a viable caster build.  It is not a DR build, but with epic Mage Armor and int 19 -&gt; everything else in Dex you will have an exceptionally high AC and require a 20 to hit you are immune critical.  At the cost of spell slots, you will net melee invulnerability.<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>"

      "content": "<div>Thanks for the info! this is helpful.<br/>\nI guess the build really doesn't compete to some of the others out there. I was thinking that I could tweak the build to have\u00a0 6 less DR to bring the spell level to 8, rearranging some stat progressions as well and I could have the caster able to use greater ruin due to Palemasters <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">13th</span> 15th level and 20 int, but I take it level 9 spells is what's important in a casting build.\u00a0<br/>\nI think the progression was something like <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Wiz11/PM13/DD6\u00a0</span>\u00a0Wiz 9/PM15/DD6<br/>\nIt's not the levels of \"you only can maybe get 3 damage per hit in if lucky\" but half damage is still twice the longevity.\u00a0</div>"
