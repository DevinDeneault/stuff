These undead defenders unswervingly protected their clan and its holdings for centuries. The majority of baelnorn were spellcasters, and they maintained their mental and magical abilities in this state, though exceptions occurred. Unlike liches, Baelnorn are willing undead, and are hardly considered corruptions as liches are.\u00a0 Indeed, they even maintained their good alignments when they achieved their undead state. This Baelnorn, while not a caster, is more of an eviscerator\u2026.</em><br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nAnd yet another Pale Master warrior for the annals of legend.\u00a0 Their number is legion, but for good reason.\u00a0 However, this one has a bit more of an RP slant to it.\u00a0 But don\u2019t let that fool you, for this pointy ear grabs both Dev Crit and Crit Immunity by Level 27.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nSimply put, this is like an Elven Version of the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build303254.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Charnel Lord</a>.\u00a0 Offered here are both a Dev Crit and Non-Dev Crit version.\u00a0 \u00a0Both are very balanced melee warriors.\u00a0 While there is a grim pleasure gained by going Dev Crit in a build that is immune to it, the non-dev crit version might actually be more fun and is bit more versatile.\u00a0 The non-dev crit version gains Improved Disarm (for situational AB boost), and also picks up an extra 2 Epic Spells to make him virtually indestructible for a short period of time, a few better summons (<em>Skeletal Blackguard and Lich</em>)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nIn both builds, Elf must be taken to achieve maximum Baelnorn-ness, though it is possible to achieve similar stat spreads with Dwarf or Half-orc.\u00a0 The goal obviously was to have a dualwielding dev critter that compensated AC with PM levels.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nIn pre-epic, one will notice that Bard is taken at unusual levels (13 and 16).\u00a0 This is to maximize the bard skill set since there is large break between the 3<sup>rd</sup> Bard level and the last Bard level.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nTwo-bladed sword is taken for style.\u00a0 While it offers better base damage over the character\u2019s career, Kukri is a worthwhile choice since it offers better threat range, and a chance to increase AB and AC by going sword and board.\u00a0 Epic Mage Armor is taken because of the return one gets for the investment.\u00a0 Assuming low to mid magic, Epic Mage Armor allows you to not have to worry about Natural AC, Deflection AC, Armor AC, and the Dodge AC will stack.\u00a0 This frees your character to wear other items that offer resistances.\u00a0 But mileage, of course, will vary depending on your environment, so feel free to choose whatever Epic Spell that tickles your fancy.\u00a0 In the non-dev crit version, you get 3, so much more freedom there.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nFor skill point distribution, on Bard Levels you want to maximize Tumble and UMD and Taunt.\u00a0 Make sure to get Perform to 10 to activate your Bard Songs as you go.\u00a0 On Fighter levels you basically bank unless you need to cross class a point into Search, Open Lock and Spot (I tend to do this for most characters when it\u2019s not a class skill, and then find ways to raise it situationally).\u00a0 On PM levels you want to hit Spellcraft every chance you get.\u00a0 Keen senses, while still useful early on, tend to go to waste in a build like this.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nThis build was playtested in the Pretty Good Character Creator and is currently being live tested from the ground up at <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/worldofgreyhawkfr/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The World of Greyhawk Action Server</a>.\u00a0 Now all I need is a bad-ass

Is there a particular reason not to include Discipline in the build(s)? Unless I'm misreading PM, it's not immune to KD or Disarm, and, other than failing a will save, my worst nightmares as a meleer are spending time on my arse and/or being weaponless. I confess, I'd be tempted to drop Taunt for it - though I appreciate that would be tough in the non-Dev Crit version.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood to have the Dwarflord back on the map!<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>\"Astrolabe whirls, astrolabe twirls.

      "content": "<div>Hi GDL!<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat to see a Pale Master build from you again!<br/>\n<br/>\nI studied quite a few Pale Master builds when I was learning how to build with the pale master class, and the pale master builds I learnt the most from were yours, both your bard/pale master and wizard/pale master builds.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not believe I have ever seen a dual wielding dev-critting fighter pale master so this is certainly unique, and I believe a very worth candidate for the level 40 section<br/>\nThere are lots of things I like in both builds both big and small. Big things like the overall AB (ie base 42 AB) / HP (400+) / Tank / Skills balance which is very nice. Small things like taking Bard(2) at level 8, for example, which allows a skill dump for UMD 10 modified, UMD 10 being a level where access to equippable items / usable spells becomes quite valuable, its fine attention to detail demonstrated there.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I was playing the first build I would make a small adjustment to drop Armor Skin and fit both Epic Mage Armor and Epic Warding, I think its just nice to have both spells, one for general usage for a minimum +5 AC and the other for situational short-term extreme tank-ability.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>30 Pale Master 13, Great Str III, Epic ER: Acid<br/>\n31 Pale Master 14<br/>\n32 Fighter 15<br/>\n33 Pale Master 15, Epic Mage Armor (or Epic Spell of Choice), Str28\u00a0<br/>\n34 Pale Master 16, Epic Warding<br/>\n35 Fighter 16, Epic WF: Two-bladed sword<br/>\n36 Fighter 17, Great Str IV\u00a0, Str30<br/>\n37 Bard 4<br/>\n38 Fighter18, Epic WS: Two-bladed sword<br/>\n39 Fighter 19, Great Str V<br/>\n40 Fighter 20, Epic Prowess, Str32</div></blockquote>\nThere are other minor changes I might make in terms of personal preference which I have listed here<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>With the first build, if I am using a two bladed sword being a large weapon (and this is very much a personal preference thing) I would very much like to have improved disarm but the cost would be dropping toughness and improved knockdown which is pretty significant. Overall the difference between the two is small. I am definitely biased towards taking Improved Disarm in large weapon wielders, I just like the feat, and pale masters definitely benefit from more AB, even if it is situational against tiny and small weapon users.\nWith the second build, given you are not going devastating critical, I wonder if it could be made stronger by dropping power attack and cleave, and rearranging feats to take two of toughness, luck of heroes, resist energy (of your choice, just not acid), expertise or called shot\n</details>\n\nStag brings up an interesting comment about discipline.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscipline protects against knockdown, disarm, called shot and 'sap' (a NPC only ability similar to stunning fist). In practice knockdown is the most important. One option is to use knockdown immune items (usually boots, sometimes helmets).<br/>\n<br/>\nTo prevent a knockdown attempt either your AC exceeds your opponents attack roll (except when they roll a 20), or if they hit the discipline score will need to equal or\u00a0exceed your opponents attack roll + size modifiers + improved knockdown modifier.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm attempting a bit of math here. If I make any errors feel free to point em out.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a Discipline Score of 43, a Str of 32 (Str modifier 11), the modified discipline score without items is 54. A similar sized enemy attempting improved knockdown (+4 bonus) with an AB of 50 is going to have a knockdown discipline check of 51 to 71, and succeed with the knockdown attempt rolling a 4 or more (succeeding 85% of the time). Capping one's strength to 44 will lead to a modified discipline score of 60, and that same opponent will succeed with the knockdown attempt when rolling a 10 or more (ie succeeding 55% of the time). Therefore in practice knockdown immunity is going to be necessary. Even a fighter RDD with base Str 42 capped at 54 and maxed discipline will have a modified 65 discipline score, and that same opponent will succeed on an improved knockdown attempt with a roll of 16 or more (25% chance)<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a PW such as WoG, where disarming opponents are not frequent (in fact I am not sure any exist) one could get away without discipline, but if they were to exist, discipline would be helpful for large weapon wielders. The same enemy attempting improved disarm with a large weapon against this build (two bladed sword version) would create a disarm discipline check of 43-63 (50 +1d20 -4 from ID -4 against large weapon), which the enemy would need to roll a 13 or more (40% chance) to disarm you, 19 or more with capped strength (10% chance).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe situation is very different for the dual kukri version of this build, kukri's being tiny weapons, the same large weapon wielding opponent would have +8 AB (12 AB difference compared to a two bladed sword) when attacking you, the disarm discipline check being 59-79, and your opponent succeeding with disarm all the time without str capped, succeeding with a roll of 2 (ie 95% success) or more with str capped. Even a tiny weapon wielding fighter RDD that opponent will succeed with a roll of 8 or more (65% success) with a fighter RDD capped str 54 given in the example.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway bit of a diversion, I very much wanted to understand the mechanics of discipline which is part of the reason why I've posted my math. glad to see you active here again GDL! Hope to have many a build discussion with you!</div>"

(just a slight joke here...get it?\u00a0 Dis-arm?!).<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding Discipline - don't forget one can have Epic Skill Focus in Discipline to boost it, and there are items that can boost that even further.\u00a0 Especially on WoG, where there are some pretty nice boosts available, not to mention the ability to put socket skill boosts on items (now, before anyone jumps on me boot first - I know the socket gem limit for skills has been pretty much nuked to oblivion, BUT one can put multiple gems of the same skill on <em>different </em>socket items and they will add together up to the limit of +50!).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is this important?<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, being able to basically ignore KD attempts without needing an item immunity obviously frees up an item slot.\u00a0 And since this is mostly (not always) Boots, that means that the Dodge AC from that item slot is now available (which is pretty nice!).<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the Build(s) - going with the Dev Crit version of Baelnorn.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is soooo hard to choose between double-sword and kukri!<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, sure, Kukri adds the advantage of being able to go Sword and Board for that lovely AC boost when it is needed, without sacrificing anything in terms of fighting ability (one gets a slight boost in AB, tbh).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut two-hander double-sword gives a lot of advantages here!\u00a0 1.5x str, only has to be weapon buffed once, and even more important, as a socket item only has to have gems for one weapon!<br/>\n<br/>\nAdmittedly, the Kukri's have a crit threat range that is just...OP.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth items on WoG are meh magical items in the wild - unless one either makes them (re: socket gems) OR gets fantastically lucky with drops (which, I have never gotten yet).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have gotten a socket gem double sword.\u00a0 No socket Kukri's, however.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do want to mention the same thing as Orion did regarding EMA and EW - which are just too good to pass up!\u00a0 Especially a Baelnorn, which is a type of Lich, meaning it should have massive magical protections (which the actual creature does).<br/>\n<br/>\nI am wondering at the possibility to include meta-magic feats to take advantage of another of the PMs abilities - advancing spellcasting ability (albeit not as it should).\u00a0 Bard is a tough one to combine with PM in this regard, but with Bard level 4 afterwards, that at least opens up the possibility of getting some higher level spells - some meta-magic feats would help this as well.</div>"

      "content": "<div>@Webshaman, PM spell progression won't work for a Bard in this instance with an 8 Charisma.\u00a0 Also, while I do agree that Epic Warding is the best defensive buff around, I don't consider it a must have in a build that's already prime on defense.\u00a0 However, in the non-dev crit version I do recommend Epic Warding.\u00a0 Both actually get Epic Mage Armor at 33rd level.<br/>\n<br/>\n@Orion, I believe I alluded to it earlier, but I just don't invest points in Discipline.\u00a0 I think it's a waste of a skill, a waste of skill points, and a total waste of a feat if one were to get an ESF in it.\u00a0 It's liberating once you divorce yourself from it.\u00a0 Believe me, I was married to that whore for many years ere I decided it was time for her to go.\u00a0 Once done, the court awards you 43 skill points that you can wherever and whenever you want.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are things that Disarm on WoG (King Snurre among others, some places in the deep, and Desert) but it's fairly infrequent and there are always ways to mitigate it.\u00a0 If I know or suspect an NPC using Disarm, I usually start off with my thrown down weapon.\u00a0 The Rhemorraz doesn't technically use the Disarm feat so there's no skill check against it (that's a matter of your weapon becoming so hot you are forced to drop it, which makes me think that RDD10 should provide immunity but that's another matter).\u00a0 But there aren't mobs using such a feat.\u00a0 Knockdown is much more frequent, and can usually be found among Giants, Dragons, named NPCs, etc.\u00a0 The built-in defense against knockdown is high AC.\u00a0 The opponent (who I believe you gave a 50 AB) is already going to be at a -4 to make that hit, which is effectively raising your AC even higher.\u00a0 We're now at a 63 with no items on the build.\u00a0 Assuming I have something minor granting +2 shield AC (from Rings or Bracers, and a modest set of +3 Dodging Boots, the AC is now 64 (39 base, +20EMA, +5 other sources).\u00a0 His 50 AB is reduced to a 46 on his first KD.\u00a0 He needs an 18 or higher to hit.\u00a0 Every swing after, until the next round, is going to require a natural 20.\u00a0 \u00a0And that doesn't even account for any concealment that we may have UMD'ed prior to the battle (Dust of Disappearance, Improved Invis, etc).\u00a0 Even if he had Blindfighting, his first swing, if rolls an 18 or higher, has a 25% to miss.\u00a0 So I like my chances... I don't like his.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the point is taken.\u00a0 If no immunities are available in your environment, then you'll likely want to move on to either another build, or drop Taunt and pump discipline.\u00a0 But the best immunity is already built in: High AC, and they can't knock you down if you splattered their guts in a devastating attack, or if they in turned are knocked down by you.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding dropping PA and Cleave in the non-dev crit version, I think that is fine.\u00a0 That's a preference thing.\u00a0 I enjoy these feats early in builds because I get a good return in my investment.\u00a0 Power Attack is a poor man's Open Lock, and Cleave is just an extra attack, which is another chance at landing a critical.\u00a0 But Toughness would be the obvious choice.\u00a0 Your second feat is a little harder to pick (but I wouldn't pick up an Energy Resistance). Or, as a way to mitigate loss of Discipline, pick up both Expertise and Improved Expertise.\u00a0 Now you they're going to need a 20.\u00a0 All the time.\u00a0 That's actually a worthwhile investment, particularly for party play, as the Baelnorn would then be able to tank indefinitely (until the bad guy mages come out).<br/>\n<br/>\nPhew!\u00a0 So much fun!\u00a0 I haven't discussed builds in years.\u00a0 \u00a0 The finer points, the nuances, the nerd mechanics, pre-epic vs post-epic, the curvature of the spine!\u00a0 I probably need to get out more.</div>"
