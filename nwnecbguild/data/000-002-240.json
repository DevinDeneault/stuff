He does not learn any new spells through this ability, <blockquote><div><strong>MrZork wrote:</strong><hr/> There would be way more sorcerer (and bard) PMs running around otherwise! :-)</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\"> </div>\n\n Probably an understatement.<br/>\n Thanks...</div>"

You gain a new slot to memorize spells per day if you're a Wizard and a new spell per day in a certain level if you are a Sorcerer.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div>"
