      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">NWN is one of my favourite games I played as a child with my friend, we had no idea what we were doing but it was loads of fun. Now that we are older we started again but we also know that just picking classes randomly and having no idea what we are doing wasn't the best way to go.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nWe started playing on a Nordock server (since that's what we played on ages ago) that seems to be relatively low magic. I found a guide here and followed it called \"Tear of the Dragon: Bard 16/Rogue 14/Red Dragon Disciple 10\". My friend just went a normal Cleric build and he is way stronger with his buffs and spells and summons. I want to create a new character now but I have no idea what build to follow because I don't really understand the theory part of the game and I just want something that will be really good from the start, Cleric level good. Requiring being 40 and stuff before I'm good isn't appealing because we probably will never make it to there. I've looked at a ton of builds but I don't really know what to look for. Would appreciate any help!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Judging by how these low magic servers are I'm guessing it needs to be something with decent buffs. But would love anything fun, especially if it deals high damage. Maybe wielding a large 2h axe or dual wielding. I already have a sword + shield guy so would maybe like a dual wielder or 2hander. But in the end it needs to be good! From relatively early levels. Preferably at least around 10+.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing I know I like is watching big numbers pop up (or loads of smaller ones), just love seeing things get wrecked! And sustainable, so a magic wielder with a few good spells and then useless isn't really my cup of tea.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
