      "content": "<div>I am feeling a bit randy tonight, so you will excuse me for taking a trip down memory lane here...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, a few years after the success of NwN 1, NwN 2 came along and offered a whole lot of new feats &amp; abilities, and the fully expanded 3.5E ruleset with it. <br/>\nAnd there were so many new toys to play with... I still hope we had those toys (through an expansion of the ruleset) for NwN 1 but alas. <br/>\nOn paper, NwN 2 appears so much more compelling to build for but in practice, things are way, way different! Let me explain...<br/>\n<br/>\nNwN 2 ruleset allows for 4 different classes to combine together and form a build, and that was a revolution on its own! We could now have the cake and eat it too! Ftr/Bard/RDD/Wm! And there were new feats too, like, <em>greater weapon focus</em> &amp; <em>specialization</em>, <em>power critical</em> (+4 on confirmation rolls), <em>monkey grip</em> (two greatswords at the same time), etc. Our charismatic characters had epic feats available to them like <em>epic divine might </em>(double the output of divine might) and our sneaky characters had epic feats like <em>perfect two-weapon fighting</em> (double the attacks of your main hand). But something had to go wrong as if some giant pendulum gave things when going forward and took back when swinging backward again.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou see, someone has to understand first how we do things here on ECB, in order to comprehend why the other half of the changes that were made were so terrible. The major bulk of all epic builders' work resides on epic levels. These 20 last levels are the most critical in a build &amp; effect the most its power level. When the epic progression \"freezes\" and all classes take a flat +10AB/+10 Saves/+7 General feats, there is your chance to insert a few levels of a class that would normally hurt to include pre-epic. You gain all of the advantages while minimizing the disadvantages. The system worked like a clock. <br/>\n<br/>\nNwN 2 system, however, is different. First, you only have 10 epic levels instead of 20, as if \"realism\" was a major concern to a high fantasy action RPG. Secondly, and most important, those 10 epic levels have normal AB progression as the 20 levels before them! That means <em><strong>your AB and number of attacks continue to increase</strong></em> normally for all 30 levels. There was no ground to make your \"special treatment\" anymore, as all levels were treated as equal for the build. Now, everything that you do has to make a significant impact on the build, otherwise is generally inferior to simply increasing your number of attacks/round, as that is multiplication and takes precedence over everything else. Combine this with what I told you earlier here. \"<em>There were many new feats &amp; the ability to take four classes </em>\". Practically, everyone had to take those new feats &amp; everyone took all four classes. That left almost zero room for experimentation on the builds. Your melee class juggernaut was a Barbarian/Frenzy Berserker/Fighter/Weapon-Master, done. It goes similar for the mages &amp; sneaks. You didn't have to select things, <strong><em>you just tried to cram all that you could into the build</em></strong>. And then, there were the dubious changes. Like, for example, they \"fixed\" improved knockdown because it was too powerful...only to be replaced by improved disarm this time around. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I hope this little tale of Neverwinter Nights history proves to be of some entertaining value to whoever reads this. <br/>\nPeace.</div>"
