I think the engine would identify them as such in the combat log. I've had a problem with initiative for a long time, it's never worked without an issue for me. I think this is just some hidden mechanic, perhaps related to weapon reach, that is hard to mitigate. I remember being perturbed about this on a permadeath modern zombie survival server.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd suggest maybe trying with a longer weapon and seeing if that helps the issue.

From Greatsword, to Halberd, to TH Spear, nothing has longer reach than a critwall buggy with either a Greataxe or a Katana, apparently.\u00a0 Luckily, the Greataxe users will suck down a potion of barkskin, often giving you the advantage, but if they notice your \"aggro\" beforehand, they will drink the potion as you are out of range.\u00a0 I've done Greataxe vs Greataxe, Katana vs Katana, and everything else inbetween, but nothing actually makes any difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think it is a matter of reach - the \"reach\" of the opponents is just longer (unless they are small vs our medium).\u00a0 The AI reacts quicker, of course, and you can see this when they rush you, stop right outside of your reach, and attack...which goes first.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe AoO is when you go into combat against them (meaning you move to engage after you have clicked the weapon pointer on them, activating attack).\u00a0 Unless you have a way to mitigate it, such will cause AoO.\u00a0 Walking into combat will keep this from happening, but then, they will attack you first, again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I just want to thank everyone for their replies, insights, and posts.\u00a0 I guess this is just a NWN Engine thing that is inherent to it.\u00a0 I just wish I coild find a way around it.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
