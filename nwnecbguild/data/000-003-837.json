      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">This weird question has its root in the Jormungandr Druid/Cleric/Monk combo. I was playing this on Blackstone Keep, a very high-magic PW, and after a while I realized that the druid spells work very well on that PW, the combat better than expected, but the Dragon Shape not so much (even though it's awesome and fun). I also realized that what was missing was mostly AB and fighter feats. Another thing that I was missing was divine damage that will cut through boss resistance/immunities, so that got me thinking about this combination. Druid for spells and other coolness, Paladin (as opposed to cleric) for number of attacks, great AB and nice divine damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way it might work would be to start out as paladin in order to get the hack-n-slash going, then add up more druid levels to be able to kill high-level critters and bosses later on. Maybe even a dex-based paladin, in order to increase survivability (with the BSK socket gem systems, I don't need STR for damage, you can create extreme high-damage weaponry), which led me to think Elf or halfling. Also, dagger/sickle seems to be the only weaponry that would work both with a dex-based Paladin and Druid (rapier if elven). Maybe add some Rogue skill dumps to get UMD and Tumble so I could use all the high-level magic items that's laying around. Also, wands.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I need at least Druid 17 (all spells), Rogue 2 and Paladin 15 (all spells). Now, I started building this in the excel thingy, but then I realized I should instead ask the professionals.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would wish to get Druid 11 fairly early, since it gives Stonehold, which reduces stress a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, here's my questions: Is this viable, or just plain stupid? <br/>\nAlso, should I go Pal21/Druid17/Rogue2 or Druid21/Pal17/Rogue2? Or maybe something else entirely? <br/>\nDex-based or not?\u00a0 (Note that on BSK, the difference is not that big between a d4 dagger and a d12 Greataxe when you can add +2d12 acid, +2d12 sonic, +2d12 fire, keen, +2d12 mass crit to any weapon. Theoretically, but maybe +2d10/+2d8/+d10/keen/+2d12 which I actually have on a scimitar.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, yes, I'm aware of the need for alignment change, which is easy to do on Blackstone from Lawful Good to Lawful Neutral or Lawful Neutral to Lawful Good. You can do it several times. (You just give the beggar some gold or push him away, simple.)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Because this dragon can breathe really well, I think 20d10 every round or so. You know, high AC/resistances &amp; infinite breath, etc. You get the idea <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\nPlus, that one will also get far better caster levels &amp; a better DC for his spells as well, so for BSK, this might actually be a stronger (blasphemy!) dragon than OoJ.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then, there is also the Druid champion (no dragon in this one) build, with Druid 24/ Pally 15/ <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Cheese </span>Monk 1, or if you want this more playable, just lower the druid a bit &amp; add more <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Bruce Lee </span>Monk. <br/>\nYou won't need dexterity at all, since Zen Archery will cover you for ranged attacks if you want this, but will still suffer from MAD. <br/>\nYou will want to have high charisma of course, and it suits us just fine that you do not particularly care about strength, since we can add more charisma that way, which in turn will net stronger divine might/shield.<br/>\nPerhaps Druid 20/ Pally 18/ <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Chuck Norris</span> Monk 2, for playability, with starting stats: (Str 16, Dex 08, Con 10, Int 10, Wis 14, Cha 16) ending in (Str 24, Dex 08, Con 10, Int 10, Wis 20, Cha 18) or something similar. <br/>\nOne problem that I see here is that you won't have a stellar AB this way. I calculate something like 37 +6 +20= 63AB top (without smite), which is at the low-end for your server, but you will still have your spells, with a decent DC/Penetration. <br/>\n<br/>\nA world of choices, oh, I love this game!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
