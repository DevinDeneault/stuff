      "content": "<div>Orion is quite right in all he says.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore offering any weapon advice, I'm afraid I have a couple of questions. First, when you say \"a two weapons weaponmaster\", do you mean one with a focus (or even WoC) in two separate weapons (eg, one slashing, one blunt), to be used singly with a shield, or one who dual-wields one weapon type (eg, twin shortswords)?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second question is about what else makes up your build. What other classes are you taking? What race will you be playing? Are you going for a strength or dexterity based build?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not asking just to be nosey, I promise. For example, if you've got some Monk in there, d-w kamas might well be a good idea. If you're thinking of halfling, scimitar will be a 2-handed weapon. If you're going Dex-based, you'll be wanting a finessable weapon. If you d-w scimitars (or any non-small/tiny weapon) you'll take an extra -2 hit to AB. And so on...<br/>\n<br/>\nThat'll teach you to ask a simple question, eh? <span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83d\ude09</span></div>",

I was thinking about dual wielding the same weapon on both hands, to maximize attack rolls, and i was aiming at the scimitar for its crit range, but i obviously didn't know that devastating critical is disabled...</div>"

Just a note of caution for Valhyr, though - I don't recall many quality kukris in Aielund, so you might want to think of dual-wielding shortswords (there are many good ones). That would also give you an extra feat, as you wouldn't need Exotic Proficiency. With a little juggling of when you take the feats, IKD might be a good one.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: I seemed to recall that Empyre had made an Aielund-specific shortsword dual-wielder, and you can find it at the top of page 7 in the Aielund thread in the Modules forum (Aielund Draco Twinblade). It's a Fighter 20/ Bard 10/ RDD 10, so not a weaponmaster, but it still has a max AB of 47, which ain't exactly shabby.</div>",

      "content": "<div>Thank you Stag!<br/>\nI want to add that I don't share that much your concern about weapon types for this weaponmaster in Aielund. In Act 1 you will find +1 Kukris. If you find other weapons you want to dual wield, he will be able to do that with little penalty.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn act 2 and onwards you will find, and even be able to buy most weapons with an adequate enhancement ,and you can add extra damage and other properties to any weapon.<br/>\nI usually spend a substantial amount of gold to have weapons with different elemental damage types available. With a dual wielder that amounts to quite a few blades.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is true that you will find more weapons of certain types, especially the kind that the henchmen use, but that should not stop you from trying something different.</div>",
