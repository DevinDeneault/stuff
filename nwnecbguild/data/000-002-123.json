I have max HP rolls before leveling.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span class=\"inline-attachment\">\n<dl class=\"fileimage display\">\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/202008/10759084_778db94fdd123f192a43f6fb63cc736f_t.jpg\" />\n</dl>\n</span>The expected HP was 160 if you look at Kamiryn's spreadsheet, but the actual HP ends up 144, 16HP less than expected.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were some changes Beamdog made to RDD and stat gain from RDD's Draconic Abilities feat in the last 6-12 months.\u00a0<br/>\nI am curious if these changes affected this.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan anyone else confirm that this is not expected or confirm they are seeing this as well?<br/>\nI have also noticed it in WoG,\u00a0 WoG uses a custom Dragon Disciple so players can have different breath types, so I made sure I also checked it in Vanilla NWN (above)<br/>\nI am using NWN EE v80.8193.13 [3ba0f825]<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
