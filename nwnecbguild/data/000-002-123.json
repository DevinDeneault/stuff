      "content": "<div>Background:<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been busy due to things happening in life, so havent been playing as often.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yesterday, when I clicked on the JOIN INTERNET multi player game button to to play on PW's like Blackstone, etc, about 3/5's, of the previously blue colored PW's(colored blue on the PW list(Means that playable, can connect, etc), are now colored gray(nonplayable, can't connect, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI checked today, and still having the same problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd not only that, but the ones that are colored grey, not playable, cant connect, are some of the most popular ones, and ones that I have toons on.<br/>\n<br/>\nPW's like Blackstone Keep, Dawn of Heroes, PW's that have 15 to 45+ on out of about 96 to 250, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd they are the same port 8193.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow the only PW that I have toons on, that I can connect to, and play is Arkhalia, fortunately one of the better PW's.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe others available to connect to, play, etc, typically 1 online out of 20 ro 40, level 20,30 max, dont look like, dont seem like they would be good, not popular, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI dont know why I could play these PW's before, and not now.<br/>\n<br/>\nI havent changed anything, so should still be able to connect, play them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I dont think PW's like Arelith, Blackstone, Forgotten Realms Cormyr, etc, popular PW's, would have ALL closed down.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am playing Neverwinter Nights EE on my LG K20 Android Phone, Snapdragon, 32GB, NWN EE is at 6 80 GB. Have a 128 GB, SD card, that is also has a attached accelerator for better performance, speed, etc. Have 2 GB, left over.<br/>\n<br/>\nGame, and the PW's worked fine as long as PW's used \u00a0NWN Sync to download the needed files to play(Why I can't play World of Greyhawk(also one of those port 8193 PW's that used to be blue, but now greyed out), because it doesnt use NWN Sync to download its files(Even dowloaded ALL the different CEP files, and still didnt work.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what is going on? Why is this happening? And are any of you able to still play on Blackstone Keep, etc, on Port 8193? <br/>\n<br/>\nCan anybody please help.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for any help.</div>"

NWN EE not there.<br/>\n<br/>\nNWN EE is on the GOOGLE PLAY current, updated, apps and games list <br/>\n<br/>\nThen I went into my settings, went to the NWN EE app page. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is NO OPTION at BOTH GOOGLE PLAY and at NWN EE app page in SETTINGS, to UPDATE, PATCH.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo because of that, I am pretty sure its the current version.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if its not, then the current, updated, patched version is only available on PC and not available to Android users, unless there is a way to BYPASS GOOGE PLAY, and go into the Android files system to download, patch, update NWN EE, without messing up your android device.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only thing I can possibly think of that might or night not have caused this, is I found a app that used to partially move NWN EE from my Android Smart Phone's 32 GB of internal memory storage, to the 128 GB, SD card.</div>"

I think its important to mention the patch number/date, the platform you are using.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps</div>"

It looks like either I have to wait for a Google play update to the Android version of NWN EE, or I might have already updated to the new version, and the new version not compatible with 8193's, like BSK, and so would have to revert to the original version that worked with 8193, BSK, by uninstalling, then reinstalling, then not updating.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with that, is I dont know if that would cause PW toons to be lost, and. I would have to spend hours, doing multiple NWN Sync downloads of PW files. And even if did all that, that might not fix the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooks like I'll just have to wait for a update patch, an or for the PW's to catch up.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the mean time at least Arkhalia PW works on 8186, and I have resumed playing on that, and its one of the better PW's on NWN EE.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also about 25 to 75 seemingly bad looking, non popular, etc, PW's on NWN EE, on 8186, that I could still play.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo guess I just have to play the wait and see what happens game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your help guys.</div>"

Then had to learn how to extract the downloaded files, and then how to self install, create the right folders, put the files in the right folders, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned how to do that right, can play those emulated games.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of what I learned from doing that, I figured out how to force NWN EE to be installed on my SD card, and not on my internal memory where Google Play installs it <br/>\n<br/>\nPutting the game on my 128 GB SD card, really freed up some space(10 GB), on my internal memory.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so because of that I figured out how to download, extract, install the NWN Mods, without using the NWN store or Google play, or even the official Beamdog, user, officially suggested, recommended way of connecting phone to computer, and using computer to install mods(Didnt have a computer, and even if I had had a computer, not sure I could have figured out how to install the mods via the computer connected to phone the official recommended way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I learned to do:<br/>\n<br/>\nStep 1: Click on file download link.<br/>\n<br/>\nStep 2: that starts the download to phone. Wait for download to finish downloading <br/>\n<br/>\nStep 3. Download a app from Google play that extracts .RAR, . ZIP, and .EXE, etc files.<br/>\n<br/>\nStep 4: Using the Extractor Google Play App, extract the downloaded files.<br/>\n<br/>\nStep 5: Step 4 is done by:<br/>\n<br/>\nA. Click on phone settinga.<br/>\n<br/>\nB. Click General Tab.<br/>\n<br/>\nC. Click Storage Tab.<br/>\n<br/>\nD. Click Explore<br/>\n<br/>\nE. That goes to a directory of all the folders on phone device.<br/>\n<br/>\nF. Goto, click download folder.<br/>\n<br/>\nG. Find Find NWN Mod file<br/>\n<br/>\nH. Then find the extract folder with a similar name to the NWN mod file, in the download folder <br/>\n<br/>\nI. In the extract folder there will be TLK, HAK, Mod, etc files.<br/>\n<br/>\nJ. Click on the files, click move or copy.<br/>\n<br/>\nK. That take you to a chpice of either using your phones internal memory or SD Card.<br/>\n<br/>\nL. Use either the SD Card or the internal Memory directory wherever NWN is installed(SD card is where NWN is installed on my phone)<br/>\n<br/>\nM. Click Android folder<br/>\n<br/>\nN. Click Data<br/>\n<br/>\nO. Click Beamdog<br/>\n<br/>\nP. Click files<br/>\n<br/>\nQ. Click Data<br/>\n<br/>\nR. Click Hak, or TLK, or Mod, wherever moved, copied file go.<br/>\n<br/>\nS. Click Move, Copy. File gets moved, copied to the Hak, or Mod, or wjatever folder.<br/>\n<br/>\nT. Rinse, Repeat until all the extracted files have been moved, copied to the right places.<br/>\n<br/>\nU. Fire up NWN.<br/>\n<br/>\nV. Click on New game.<br/>\n<br/>\nW. Click other modules.<br/>\n<br/>\nX. Look for, click on WOG mod(or the mod installed)<br/>\n<br/>\nY. Click on New Character, which SHOULD quickly fire up mod if installed it right(Sometimes it doesnt work, because either installed it wrong or some other reason.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a lot easier then trying to connect phone to computer, then use computer(The official Recommended Beamdog way, that I would have a hard time with, even if I had a computer(I dont have a computer)<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I have the following mods that work just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nEye of the Beholder.<br/>\n<br/>\nEye of the Beholder 2, Legend of Darkmoon.<br/>\n<br/>\nPool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor.<br/>\n<br/>\nPool of Radiance(Sou Edition)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bard's Tale, Tales of the Unknown<br/>\n<br/>\nArcanium<br/>\n<br/>\nCareenan(lev 1 to lev 35)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Lord of Terror, A Diablo Campaign<br/>\n<br/>\nRaines World of Greyhawk(The OFFLINE SINGLE PLAYER version of the ONLINE version of WOG)<br/>\n<br/>\nDont have Aielund because its a series of Mods <br/>\n<br/>\nMost of these mods are non series, 1 single mod that takes you from either levels 1 to 13, Lev 1 to 20, Lev 1 to 30, lev 1 to 35, Lev 1 to 40, Lev 8 to 30, lev 10 to 25, Lev 15 to Lev 23, Lev 20 to Lev 30, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only exception is the Pool of Radiance Ruins of Myth Drannor Mod that is 1 mod broken into 4 mods that take you from level 1 to level 15 to lev 20(where you get to fight a dracolich)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe mods are all installed and work just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking forward to playing these mods, and Arkhalia PW, until my access to all the other PW's gets restored by Beamdog via another android update.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh BTW, now that I have Raines WOG installed, working, ready to play, is there any advice from you WOG players out there on how to play thru WOG?</div>"

Need a +1 BAB at 1st Lev. The classes like Cleric, etc, that could benefit from a extra +1 to hit from Weapon Focus, at 1st level, cant get it, that at 1st Level, and the classes like Fighter, etc, already start with a BAB of 1, instead of zero, and so kind of either dont need the extra +1 from Weapon Focus at level 1, or need it a lot less then other classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 3, 6, is where want to take WF, if you need it for both hitting, EWF, Prestige classes, etc, and if there isnt something more important to take instead at that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course you already know this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI extremely rare get level 1 wrong, bad.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with earlier levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nUncommon that get levels 3 to 6 wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 9 at the earliest that sometimes get wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 12+ is where I sometimes, usually go wrong sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy level 16 to 20+ I have usually screwed up at least a little tiny bit somewhere<br/>\n<br/>\nBy, in Epic Levels, levels 25 to Lev 30,  I almost always have screwed up something.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course thats on the 1st or 2nd try at a build.

While XP is ok, not enough, AKA no loot, gp, money, things that can be sold for gp at least thru first 3,4, etc, beginning levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Brown Bear, Animal Companion, and Summon boar, seem to either want to either stand there, do nothing, not attack, or run away, come back, run away again, come back again, back and forth, over and over, when nothing else is there except the thing that is winning, beating, killing you, because of the no help from summons. On the extremely rare times they do help, the animal companion, summon kick but.<br/>\n<br/>\n8. Can only rest once per every about 8 to 12 to 16 hours. Not only that, but even if there are absolutely no hostiles anywhere even remotely close to being remotely close, and nothing there, still get \"This is not a ok area to rest\", or \"This not a safe area to rest, etc. This makes it extremely tough at lower levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n9. No henchies(At least I cant seem to find any henchies to hire.<br/>\n<br/>\n10. A lot of the monsters at even the lowest levels have poisons, special attacks, status ailments, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n11. And if those arent bad enough, I cant even find a key to get into the Moathouse in the Hommlet Area.<br/>\n<br/>\n12. Even the smallest things like rats, insects, bunny rabbits, badger, dogs, etc, can easily kill you at 2nd level.<br/>\n<br/>\n13. Quite annoying to watch either a rat, badger, dog, etc, kill you, while your brownbear, and badger do nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\n14.

      "content": "<div>Hail Asturonethoriusaline<br/>\nGreat to hear you are trying out the WoG single player module<br/>\nIt was designed as a challenging but fun mid magic (up to +5-6) party server<br/>\nPlaying solo as a result should push the boundaries of your skill level<br/>\nJust remember if you are finding it hard, it is because you are being challenged but you are also learning whilst doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Animal companion:</strong><br/>\nI faced the same problem as you playing my druid. The default behaviour is to fight but only it is safe. Unfortunately the encounters are generally, very unsafe. I found it best to ask my animal companion to \"Fight to the death\". You can do this by speaking to your companion outside of combat. Later on you must be prepared to receive damage for your animal companion, as your companion will have terrible AC compared to the enemies out there.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>\"Extremely tough\":</strong><br/>\nIf you feel this way I would suggest starting with an 'easy' build, once you have learnt how to play well, you can upgrade your skill level to that of <em class=\"mention\">@Aquarius 233</em>\u00a0and play a Bard-orcerer and kill Lloth / Althea / Vaine etc solo\u00a0.\u00a0<br/>\nClose to pure cleric is what I would recommend, and keep leveling cleric to undispellability (24) before any significant investment in a multiclass.\u00a0<br/>\nAnimal domain is good to use for empowered summons, until you get to epic levels, then it tends to fall off<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing that would help is to consider strategies.<br/>\nA good starting strategy is to pull single enemies with a ranged weapon away from all that enemies's friends<br/>\nThen attempt to defeat that enemy. This is called \"Pull and Slay\" (or Run away), a phrase that WebShaman has coined.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaximillan Kane wrote a guide to <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/playing-better-the-importance-of-knowledge-and-int-t2354384.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">playing better</a>, I found it helpful when I started WoG some 10-12 months ago<br/>\nIn terms of playing better if I get defeated by the server/module I like to look at the combat log.<br/>\nIt tells me what happened and why I died. It might be that my weak fortitude save was targeted and I died to a death spell that I wasn't aware of, or my AC wasn't high enough to melee and the opponent critically hit me as a result.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see you started at the Moathouse, but if it helps, I am of the opinion Ruskis is easier to level a low level character up in.<br/>\nIt may be worth trying Ruskis at some stage to contrast and compare. if you can try it on single player, do try to remember what Shipwreck asks you to do because it won't be listed in the quest log, its the way DM Nocturne designed that area at the time.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSingle player has the advantage of being able to pause the game over the server, feel free to utilise this for the time being.<br/>\n<br/>\nThats probably enough from me at least, the others have given you some advice too I'm sure you can make the transition\u00a0</div>"

Those can greatly help at lowest levels.<li>use powerful builds at least in your first adventure, e.g. bard/fighter/RDD, cleric with UMD who can help you levelling faster and have defensive/offensive abilities.</li>\n<li>(if you have UMD) Play with the enchanced edition, so wands of magic missile cost less and can be bought from shops at lv 1/2.</li>\n<li>read the combat log.</li>\n<li>if you can access to damage reduction/items with damage resistance properties, or other immunity items don't sell them unless you have already an item.</li>\n<li>if you play bards/wiz/sorcerers, evaluate to take \"craft wand\" to save spells and be able to use that \"haste\" or \"invisibility\" spell when you need it.</li>\n<li>think about mapping the areas, it is very useful.</li>\n</ul>\n\nIf you want to ask something \"spoilerous\", write me a PM and I will be happy to help ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: the loading time is slow also for me, I think this happens because WoG is very big!</div></blockquote>\n\nHey thanks for the help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm building a Monk/Druid/Shifter: Monk 6/Druid 18/Shifter 16(Dragon at 30th level) Pre Epic: Monk 4/Druid 6/Shifter 10(10th lev shifter at 16th lev(Mind Flayer, Medusae, etc)<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently at 3rd level: Monk 1/Druid 2. Almost 4th level Monk 1/Druid 3)<br/>\n<br/>\nStarted as Druid 1. Lv 2: Monk. Lv 3: Druid. Lv 4: Druid.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I did get the druid summoning book. I guess I misunderstood what the book was. I thought it was a way to be able to continue summoning, when either your summon duration ran out and summon disappeared, an or when summon spells ran out.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll be sure to use the black bear, and brown bear summons in place of badger, boar.<br/>\n<br/>\n2 brown bears is pretty good.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be nice to get magic items, but right now, I dont have enough money to get even 1 minor +1 item, and might probably not get 1 anytime soon as not getting gold, magic items to sell generally.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 1 exception is that I got 150 gp, and a Tower Shield +1 that had to crawl back to the trading post with, to sell for about 250 to 500 gp.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight now I have 250 gp. Used to have 900 gp, but spent a lot of that on: 7 cure light potions, 3 cure moderate potions, 7 bless potions, 10 things of food(the past difficulty of WOG was burning thru my gold like crazy, thru having to buy food, bless, cure potions. And dying 5 times costed 500 xp, and about 125 to 250 gp.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's on top of the starting 1000 gp(Which is quite generous comparatively), but spent most of that on starting equipment, supplies, etc, so had about 125 gp to 250 gp to 333 gp left over out of the starting GP.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sure that now that I am starting to kick butt now, and as I do the moathouse that I'll eventually get more gp, and magic items to use, sell, and that I won't have to burn gp on consumables just to survive.</div>"

No magical weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen went to Nulb, and shopped at Mother Screngs, and Otis the Smith merchants. Still no magic weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nCouldnt either figure out or get into the black market at Nulb, that may or may not have had magic weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso wondered if it was just the 1.69 version of the mod, that there was bugs, glitches, prevent8ng finding, getting, buying +1 weapons, etc, as I tried to go to Verbonc, but the area was not finished.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I went all the way from Hommlet to the City of Greyhawk area, and FINALLY found decent magical gear, magic weapons(even a +2 Scimitar).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal record for length of time, and highest level without at least a +1 magical weapon, even if only a +1 dagger, was level 9 in a Darksun game, where you made a character tree of 10 to 100 characters(Thats how tough the game was(most of the characters died as gladiatorial slaves in the Arena).<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the time I finally found a magical weapon, my character was 8th level, almost 9th level.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I almost tied my record in the Darksun game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt shouldnt take 8 levels to find, get a magical weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know some of you, think that's on me, and on my lack of knowledge about the PW.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd perhaps that's right. But even if that's right a mod, PW, should still provide magic weapons, that are easy enough to find, buy, by 8th level, provided the player at least tries, isnt lazy, isnt silly, semi earns it, etc, even if the player lacks knowledge about the PW.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the 1st Mid, PW, out of All the many ones, I have played, that has had me not find, get, buy, etc, a magical weapon until 8th level.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeck even BSK with a reputation as a challenging PW, like unto Wog, can easily find, get, buy a magical weapon by levels 1 to 4.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as crazy as it is, was, not finding a magic weapon until 8th level is, was, it is, was what it is, was.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoving on.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinished getting gear, spending gold. 5k gp left.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn my way to Temple of Elemental Evil.</div>"

Yes it is higher magic, up to +7,+8,+9 items at 40th level.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah you can buy +1 items in beginning shops, but the selection is not good, and the items are still quite pricey, and you have to EARN the gold to buy the items.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd even tho higher magic, you have to play well, because if you dont, the PW does a extremely good job throwing CHALLENGING stuff at you.<br/>\n<br/>\nArkhalia is another one. It even says that even tho it has high magic items, that without a minimum AB of 65 to 70, and OPTIMIZED builds at levels 30 to 40, your toast.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe PW has +1 items in beginning shops, but again you have to EARN the gold to buy them, and again the selection isnt good. And to find, get, buy better items, you have to go thru tough areas, dungeons, an or get to cities, towns, a long ways away, that are quite hard to get to.(Example Dener, you have to get thru Umber Hulks, and hordes of intellect devourers, just to get to Dener and either have a better selection of +1,+2 items, an or have a limited selection of +3,+4,+5 items.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there are Mods like:<br/>\n<br/>\nLord of Terror, Diablo Campaign<br/>\n<br/>\nEye of the Beholder<br/>\n<br/>\nPools of Radiance, Ruins of Myth Drannor.<br/>\n<br/>\nThose PW's, Mods are quite comparable to Wog, difficulty wise, with the exception being magic gear.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut other then those that I named and maybe a couple others, etc, your right that a lot, most PW's, Mods, are pretty easy, comparatively to WOG.</div>"
