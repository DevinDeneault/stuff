I think I can manage to restructure it to suit but the question is whether to have a warhammer and shield for the most part and use a greataxe for crit immunes or battle axe with shield and a heavy flail as the 2 hander option. Is it just personal choice or is there a game based reason why one might be better than the other?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I've never gone with an axe or flail there, so can't be terribly helpful, but iirc some Dwarven waraxes do turn up later on - though I can't recall where or from whom, nor what properties they had, sorry. I can't say I've needed more than a warhammer to complete the saga, and I've detailed their properties in the attachment.<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/mines-of-twin-summits-1-2-and-3-t2354731-s170.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MTS pg 18</a><br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
