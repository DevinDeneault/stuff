Is it physical or elemental? Or is it spellcasting related (ie Bigby's/IGMS)<br/>\nWhere do spellcasters, both divine (ie cleric) and arcane (ie wizard/sorc) fit into the picture?<br/>\nIs Use Magical Device (UMD) useful to cast spells from scrolls/wands and equip items?<br/>\nHow strictly are alignment restrictions enforced? Can you go Bard / DD / PM for example?<br/>\n<br/>\nYou brought up dwarven defender, I suspect for a reason.<br/>\nAre you looking to tank physical damage against opponents?<br/>\nDoes this mean you face many high physical damage dealing opponents?<br/>\nDoes the dwarven defender damage reduction continue to improve every 4 levels plus a bonus feat after Dwarven Defender 30?\u00a0<br/>\nA fighter 10 DD 30 with\u00a0EDR III\u00a0provides damage reduction 30/- (21/- plus 9/-), for example.<br/>\nA fighter 10 DD 50 would have damage reduction 42/-<br/>\nBut what if you had a Wizard 26 / Paladin 4 / DD 30 who can cast Improved Invisibility/Premonition/Epic Warding, all sorts of buffs, enemies can kill themselves on extended Mestil's Acid Sheath and extended Elemental Shields, mind immunity from Mind Blank, death magic &amp; negative energy immunity from Shadow Shield etc etc and you can cast Bigby's to disable opponents, Mords to remove enemy buffs, ILMS/IGMS spam (ie ILMS + still ILMS + IGMS + still IGMS + empowered IGMS + maximize IGMS to fill 4\u00a0 5 6 7 8 and 9) etc etc plus you have disease/fear immunity and great saves, maybe divine might<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway some ideas for you to think about maybe the best way to approach this is to keep discussing what you are looking for until we get the answer you seek<br/>\nPerhaps there are others who have experience playing lvl 60 builds<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

As you lvl up you visit the forge to upgrade your +1 to +2 and so on. Max of 8 properties per item. You basically buy basic gear and upgrade as you level up. My 40+ chars are using the same items i bought at lvl 1 just upgraded with 8 properties on each. They do a great job of keeping your character balanced for the content intended for your level range.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI am currently using Andariel build by Valerfor. I am lvl 45 and end game mobs have no trouble hitting my 75 ac.<br/>\nEnemy mobs are a mix of physical and magic users. You have to be prepared for both. This can be a challenge with no immunity gear on the server.<br/>\n<br/>\nPale masters are not allowed to select epic mage armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nEpic Dragon Knight and Mummy dust have been buffed to be powerful summons.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlignment changes are allowed and can be done anytime with simple keyboard commands.<br/>\n<br/>\nRDD is very good because of fire immunity. Lots of fire based damage resulting in your character looking like burnt toast after some encounters.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe strongest character I have teamed up with so far said his build was Druid/monk/DwD. He was plowing through mobs in elemental or dragon form while i was constantly using invis pots to hide and\u00a0 heal up.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeal pots and kits have been nerfed to heal a max of 150 damage each use. Your 1k hp seems awesome until you drink a potion of Heal and it barely moves up your health bar. You are forced to heal early and often.<br/>\n<br/>\nNpc wand crafter will make wands with any spell up to lvl 4. I carry keen edge and improved invis wands around.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall I am loving the server and it is the most balanced and challenging PW I have found. I seen lvl 60 server and assumed high magic broken characters. I could not have been more wrong. An item with only Haste has a lvl req of 9. No passing good gear down to fresh alts because of the level reqs. Early levels you are not trying to finish a zone for quick levels you are trying to just survive until you get that level for a chance to upgrade gear.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a pet project of Bard/rdd/dwd since you are allowed simple alignment changes. I am lvl 40 on that character and it has potential but the build is very rough and unrefined. I am surviving content just have lower ab than expected.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the reply and I will gladly share any more needed information.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Lasting inspiration can be obtained with level 20 to make the song last a long time<br/>\nRDD provides AC / HP / great immunities as mentioned, stat boosts, and has Epic Prowess / Epic Damage Reduction as bonus feats<br/>\nDwarven Defenders have great HP, immunity to sneak from flanking, dexterity AC protection, get Epic Prowess / Epic Weapon Focus / Overwhelming Critical / Devastating Critical / Epic Energy Resistance / Epic Damage Reduction as bonus feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did write a\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/draconic-dwarven-attacker-sorc-6-rdd-12-dd-22-t2355163.html#p16869\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dwarven Draconic Attacker</a>\u00a0(Sorc RDD DD) with dev crit, AB 44 at 40 but I feel we can create something more focused to your level 60 goal which suits your needs better to try to incorporate dev crit, decent AB, EDR III / high damage resistance.\u00a0<br/>\nIn terms of the source of AB, I take it strength is what you are pursuing rather than dexterity.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think perhaps a Bard 20 / Dwarven Defender 30 / RDD 10 split might be good here? Aiming for Bard/Curse Song 16, EDR III, Dev Crit, UMD, Tumble, Lasting Inspiration, Blind Fight/Improved Knockdown?<br/>\nBard 20 / DD 26 / RDD 14 might be ok too for some late spot and search skill dumps as well. Just depends on how much DR you want and whether those skill dumps would be helpful for you.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I am by no means a master at builds so I feel like my character has room for improvement. My personal preference on characters tend to be more tanky str based melee. I like to aggro a whole room full of mobs and pull them to the middle and mow them down. With that said I am leaning towards the Bard 20/ Rdd 10/ dwd 30 you mentioned for max damage reduction.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I would suggest opting for more than Bard20 so that you can get Lasting Inspiration early in the build and still have Bard levels left for skill dumps. Bard24/RDD10/DD26 loses 3/- DR but it is undispellable (assuming vanilla dispel) and has room for skill dumps after LI. It's tempting to go for more Bard levels to improve Bard Song but Bard32/RDD10/DD18 loses 9/- DR compared to a Bard20/RDD10/DD30, and going for less Bard levels results in a non-optimal class spread.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're going for a Bard/RDD/DD then Bard20/RDD10/DD30, Bard24/RDD10/DD26, or Bard32/RDD10/DD18 are the class spreads I would recommend. In all three cases I would go with a pre-epic spread of Bard6/RDD4/DD10, then go for RDD9 by level 25 in order to get the most skill points.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Furthermore, if you wanted to enhance the \"invulnerable\" aspect of your hero then you could change some epic feats for another elemental resistance, other than fire of course, just like \"the resistor\" did back then (Legacy ECB Archives). Say, for example, Fire &amp; Acid is the most prevalent source of dmg at high-levels, then you will be immune to fire from RDD &amp; then maybe 40 resist on Acid along with 30+ physical resistance from DD, I think they will bond well together. If the other source of dmg is magical or somesuch, ignore this &amp; continue raising your Str. <br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, Andariel has a max 84AC on +5 PW (As a level 40 Char). <br/>\n10 (base) +1 (dex) +11 (Plate &amp; Shield) +8 (Tumble) +5 (Rdd) +12 (PM) +5 (EMA) +1 (MA) +25 (Items) +4 (Haste) +2 (AS, if taken) = 84AC.<br/>\nAs a level 60 build (Bard 12/\u00a0 RDD 10/ Pale Master 38) it goes as high as 97AC (+8 PM, -1 RDD, +2 Song, +4 Tumble) alongside 40/- Acid resist, 20/- Cold? resist &amp; 1900 Epic Warding Shield.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nLess offensive than the Bard/DD/RDD combo though. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, happy gaming &amp; keep us informed on how your journey goes!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
