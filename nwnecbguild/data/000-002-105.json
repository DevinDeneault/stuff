      "content": "<div>Hi all,<br/>\n<br/>\nLately I've picked up NWN again because it is dear to me. Lots of fond memories.  I was looking around at the melee builds and was just wondering how, all in all, devastating a \"low\" will save can be, and what ranges of will saves are considered low, medium, and high. What in the NWN game can kill you if you fail a will-save? I've always been under the impression it's mostly a worry of losing control of your character to be sneak attacked or have other abilities take advantage of you not responding, but I'm not sure what, if anything, there is that will kill you outright if failed (I mean will save, only, not together with fortitude).<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks - happy to see people enjoying the game and the fun in building so much still!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-JimDandy</div>"

      "content": "<div>Thanks, Mick Dagger. When a build claims to have good saves, what would you say is the criteria? Off the top of my head, 18 seems to be the lowest you get in most melee oriented builds - granted, they usually have spells or feats to help them increase this. Do you have any input on that?<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch obliged,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-JimDandy</div>"

      "content": "<div>A typical melee character like a Fighter has will as her low save, with a +6 bonus at lvl 20 and +16 at lvl 40. If you multiclass different classes with low will saves, you risk ending up with +5 and +15. If your wisdom is 8 (which is often the case in these builds), you also get a -1 modifier. I believe +4 at 20 and +14 at 40 is as low as you can get.<br/>\nA high will save class, like Cleric or Druid has a +12 bonus at 20 and +22 at 40(, and can reach +16 and +26 with creative multiclassing). A high wisdom will add to that, eg. +5 from wis 20, or +10 from wis 30, so will save bonus above +15  at lvl 20 and above +30 at lvl 40 is not uncommon.<br/>\nDifferent general feats, class feats and racial feats will also add to the saves.<br/>\nThe spellcraft skill will also add +1 to saves vs spells for every 5 modified ranks.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what is considered high and low, you ask.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt depends fully on what you are up against. <br/>\nThe Death gaze has a DC of 10 + half the character level (14 for a vanilla lvl 9 bodak, but 30 for a custom made lvl 40 epic bodak).<br/>\nAn epic sonic trap has a DC of 30.<br/>\nThe DC of the fear aura of a great wyrm (dragon lvl 37 or higher) is 37.<br/>\nA wizard with int 38 and epic spell focus will cast lvl 1 spells with a DC of 31 and lvl 9 spells with a DC of 39.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour saving throw is a 1d20 + save bonus against the DC of the spell/effect.</div>",

      "content": "<div>I'd like to second what Mick said about immunities and sort of make it more specific. Generally speaking, when playing a meleer against ANYTHING that can affect your will save, Clarity potions (or wands) are a must. If that thing is hard to kill, then recasting is also a must, which basically means you should literally carry at least two stacks of 10 clarity potions before adventuring and restock when you go to town to sell. The main trouble is when you don't know what you're up against, turn a corner and see a dragon or undear, which turns on the Fear aura before you have a chance to use a potion (although you have to be quite slow to fall to that, cuz they take a long time activating fear and remain still while they do so). So, summarizing, if your world doesn't have immunities or if you just have better items to equip, Clarity potions are a melee character's best friend.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow on to the second p\u00e1rt of what I wanted to say, there are characters built with focus on saves, which are pretty much immune to anything except a natural 1. Characters such as Paladin / CoT builds with a focus on CHA, or even Paladin / BGs or worse, Pal/BG/CoT. However, Pal/BGs are illegal in most servers because of conflicting alignments, so the most common high-save build is a Pal / CoT / Monk with more than 18 levels of CoT. Something like a charisma-focused Pal 15 Cot 22 Monk 3 will have extremely high saves if at least one Monk is taken pre-epic cuz Monks have all three saves as strong ones, adding to your base save scores. With Divine Grace and Sacred Defense (the latter counts towards the cap) you'll have +11 to all saves + your CHA modifier, which should be at least a base of 26 (+8 Modifier), reaching a cap of +14 with capped CHA. so a total of +25 to all saves + the base score is respectable to say the least.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

Though I'm not sure why you're looking at CHA for Will saves, its modifier is WIS. You get +1 to all 3 saves automatically every even level of CoT you take (Sacred Defence), regardless of your stats (thus +5 for 10 levels of CoT).<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll generally try to get my Will save to 20 or above for a melee build (which tends to be most of mine), which ain't great, but isn't abominable either. That said, I'll still always be on the lookout for mind/fear protection gear (unless I get to Monk 20, when it becomes redundant). CoT and Monk are your best melee-types for good saves, other than Paladin, which <em>does</em> use its CHA modifier for save boosts (and grants immunity to fear at level 3, iirc).<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",
