You will, of course need a DEX of 15+ in order to take Ambidexterity (unless you take Ranger and its inherent D-W feat/s).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you take ITWF is a matter of personal taste, by and large (provided you have BAB of 9+). For myself, I prefer to wait until my AB is higher before grabbing that extra off-hand attack. After all, if you take it when it first becomes available, you'll be making the attack at -7 from your optimal AB (-5 if a kama Monk), and you're not going to hit much then without a 20 roll. There are probably more beneficial feats that could be taken earlier instead. But then, I tend to take all d-w feats later than many here do anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
