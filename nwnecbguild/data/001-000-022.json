When you can use morning star (which is 1D8 and does bludgeoning and piercing) with the same feat, the mace is surely one of the worst weapons in the game. I guess one good reason is for use as an off-hand weapon for two-weapon fighting against skeletons.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I'm with you all the way on morningstar. Unfortunately, it's treated with little or no love by many module creators, and coming across decent ones is as rare as rocking-horse droppings. And, of course, you can use it as your main-hand weapon against skelly-types (iirc it's only flail you can't d-w).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the mace goes, as a small weapon it's quite useful for hin or gnome builds who want a blunt focus, and it's probably better than a toffee-hammer. Which is hardly the most ringing endorsement.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Yeah, it seems weird (like A LOT of other peculiarities of the game) that a weapon known for being heavy, which weighs more than many medium weapons, does such poor damage. They could have at least made it 1d8 but only bludgeoning. I'm making a toon based around a Drum Major of Torm theme (brd, clr, COT). Of course, mace is the ceremonial weapon of a drum major and he needs a weapon focus for COT. He's standing in front of Olgerd with a mace in one hand and a morning star in the other and Olgerd is making some hints that he should hurry up and buy something. <br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my G3125 using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I appreciate it would negate the possibility of going sword 'n' board, but it might be worth a thought...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd while the concept of a keen mace jars a little, Mick is, of course, quite right.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">\"Oh, no! My weapon has only d4 base damage!\" - said the rogue, and rolled 20d6 for sneak damage :D<br/>\nI think at higher levels it does not really matter how much is your weapon's base damage, because it is only a small portion of your full damage. If not, you should seek for another solution to beat that enemy (like holy traps against undead, who laugh at your sneaks).<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit<br/>\nFor a bard/cleric/cot build you can gain extra damage from gmw, bard song, darkfire, divine might, smite evil, bulls, dp, etc... if you add all of these, you might realize that the d8 of the morningstar is only a slightly better than the d4 of the mace, while the mace fits much better for the concept. Of course on lower levels the morningstar could be a better choice, however as you gain power you can switch to a mace.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
