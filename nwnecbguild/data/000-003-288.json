      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">You are part-right Theofilus but don't forget that Puissant Paladin was a pure build and thus he had all those six bonus Epic Feats to work with and none of the pre-requisites of a WM or a HS. Kidmiracleman asks for a Paladin/ WM/ HS though with about 20 lvls of Pally, so let's see if this is possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n 1) Dodge<br/>\n 2) Mobility<br/>\n 3) Spring Attack<br/>\n 4) WF: Scimitar<br/>\n 5) IC: Scimitar<br/>\n 6) Expertise<br/>\n 7) Whirlwind Attack<br/>\n 8) Alertness<br/>\n 9) Iron Will<br/>\n 10) Power Attack<br/>\n 11) Divine Might<br/>\n 12) Divine Shield<br/>\n 13) Blind Fight<br/>\n<br/>\n This is a bare-bones build such as he asked, and those are only the pre-epic feats as you see. I did not take even Knockdown and he still needs five feats more than he has available if he goes Human. He needs to take those feats from his Epic General Feats and therefore he will have only two more available to take EWF and EP. He needs at least 23 Paladin OR 13 WM there, to be able to take Armour Skin. He will have two bomus Great CHA from HS lvl 1 &amp; 5 but that's it for ability increases. No feats left for anything else. Well, to be precise if we go for something like Paladin 28/ HS 5/ WM 7 he will have One epic feat available to take whatever he wants. Going WM heavy (which is the opposite of what he asked) let's say Paladin 13/ HS 5/ WM 22 will give him Two free Epic General Feats for ability increases, plus an Epic Toughness feat, and that's it. So even if we truly optimize his starting stats thhe best we can get is something like this,<br/>\n<br/>\n (<strong><em>Paladin 13/ HS 5/ WM 22</em></strong>)<br/>\n<br/>\n STR 16 (<strong>28</strong>)\u00a0 DEX 13\u00a0 CON 08\u00a0 INT 13\u00a0 WIS <strong>08\u00a0 </strong>CHA 16 (<strong>18</strong>)<br/>\n<br/>\n This is nowhere the 37 Strength he needs, neither has 20 lvls of Paladin and he doesn't have the ability to cast spells at all because the ability points are simply not enough after the requirements of the WM (13 DEX &amp; INT), plus he doesn't have KD/ IKD. Don't misunderstand me, it is not a bad build for a straight-up beater but it's not something that one would build for while there are other (much better) solutions. Replacing HS with Rogue OR Bard for example would net the same ability scores because one wouldn't have to take these pre-epic feats with his Epic General ones, plus it would give him Evasion &amp; UMD, not so hard to see which is better eh? Again, not saying this is impossible to be build, but it's bloody difficult for no reason.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>I apologize if the answer tire you all, i just couldn't explain it better without going into these details</em><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It would have to, really. There's no build that can reach 37 without some sort of subrace bonus (and a BIG one) or a point-buy twink. So, since you know where all the ability bonuses can come from on your server, what is the minimum STR you need by level 40 to reach the 37 you need?\n<blockquote><div>\n I thought I have mentioned that before.</div></blockquote>\n In this topic? Where?\n<blockquote><div>\n Also the derro subrace get +2 to Cha.<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n Helps.

Either you go for a <strong>Paladin 20/ Fighter 4/ WM 16</strong> OR <strong>Paladin 20/ Fighter 6/ DD 14</strong>. Only* these two compinations can provide you with enough feats to complete your build, especially in the second case you won't have any problem at all, since DD only needs two feats (dodge, toughness) to qualify.<br/>\n<br/>\n * Hmm, you can try and squeeze more DD levels here and replace Fighter with Rogue too, for Evasion, more AC and UMD. <strong>Paladin 20/ Rogue 2/ DD 18</strong> would be a truly maximized build here, with Rogue levels taken all in Epics at 22nd and 37th levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n What you cannot do is put all of Paladin 20/ WM xx and DD xx, in one build. There are simply not enough feats for that, at least not if you want to use your Epic general feats for Great STR ones that you need.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Feats (mandatory, but in any order you like): dodge, toughness, expertise, mobility, spring attack, WF and Whirlwind. \u00a0Intimidate 4 is the only skill prereq needed. \u00a0The rest into Discipline, cross-class tumble &amp; whatever else you favor.<br/>\n<br/>\n Epic: Bump CON three more times immediately and then finish with two more STR. I took 7 WM starting at 21 but you can flop them around if you want. Feats: Imp Crit (that's the way it goes from feat starvation), WoC (WM), EWF, Prowess, Armor skin, the EDR at Levels 33, 36 and\u00a039.<br/>\n<br/>\n By Level 40, STR will be 21, HPs in the 650-700 range. \u00a0Add 10 legendary bumps = 31, then 6 Grt STR reaches the 37 target. \u00a0With the remaining feat, either Blind fight (my preference) or KD for a special attack. \u00a0What you do for additional class levels in legendary is up to you. \u00a0More DWD for better DR or more WM for better AB. \u00a0I'll leave figuring the stats to you since you are the legendary level specialist, not I.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
