The result performed very well, and I was able to play it solo through the World of Greyhawk PW with no major hindrances.\u00a0<br/>\nYou have very high damage output basically all your melee life (say from level 9 on), and your AB is consistently high as well. AC lags a bit behind but should be alright in epics, and it is high in the endgame levels.<br/>\nDispels are annoying as with any self-buffer, but Craft Wand is your friend! You can easily rebuff if you get dispelled/breached as long as you plan ahead in wand and spell preparation.<br/>\nDamage shields and casters in general are an issue, but you have several weapons against them: 1. Self-silence before they buff and kill them, 2. Wait out the shields, and 3. A bow. Number 1. In particular works well against bosses and is very satisfying. Number 3. works as long as you can keep Spell Resistance up.<br/>\nThe best part of playing this build was fighting certain kinds of bosses, e.g. dragons, who will cast some buffs and use some abilities before they start hitting you. Like cast Haste - cast Spell Mantle - use breath weapon a couple times. You deal so much damage that by then they are down to using their heals and the fight is over before it even starts :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Choice discussion and variations:</strong><br/>\nAn obvious variation one can make is to end on 20 WIS and 28 DEX for more spells, see the balanced version below.<br/>\nApart from that, one can play around with starting stats a bit (lowering CHA to raise INT or CON, for instance), change domains, change levelling order, and change feats.<br/>\nCraft Wand is amazing in this build if you have access to unlimited XP and gold, and Trickery is chosen in part because invisibility spells can be put on wands. Magic is chosen because it\u2019s the best you can do on WoG as a Lawful Human with Trickery, and it turns out that it too provides nice spells (MA, Ice Storm, Stoneskin make good wands!). If I had a free domain choice, or if I wanted to drop Craft Wand, I would go Plant, War, Travel, or Animal instead of Magic. Trickery is too good on a melee build with low HP, and as a plus it allows you to turn into a Rogue once a day; so that I would keep in any case.<br/>\nApart from Craft Wand, the only other feat I would consider changing is Epic Prowess for Improved Crit. I think as long as you have keen kamas EP represents more damage in reasonable situations, but I\u2019m not sure. And it depends a lot on enemy DR/DI.<br/>\nThe levelling order I propose gets EWS at 24 and undispellability at 34. You could argue that an earlier undispellability is more important, this was a tough choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Balanced version:</strong><br/>\nFollowing feedback by Maximillian Kane, here is a more balanced version of the build which has access to level 9 spells and a couple more spellslots at lower levels. The price to pay is -1 AB (and slightly different saves, one can argue whether better or worse).\u00a0<br/>\nI believe this version is slightly worse at level 40: you have an extra 6 level 9, 1 level 7, 1 level 3 slots, which is not bad, but no great spells to fill them with. Realistically your Summon VIII become Summon IX and you gain some extra Extended Regenerate/Mass Heal.\u00a0<br/>\nOn the other hand, the extra 1 AB means 20+ damage/round vs 70ish armor, which is 10% of your damage output. That is quite a lot, so I prefer the \u201cgreedy\u201d version as a level 40 build.<br/>\nA major difference is while levelling though: the greedy version has only level 7 spells until level 32, while the balanced version gets level 8 spells at 15 and level 9 spells at 21. That should make the high teens-low epic levels a lot easier. Not that they are hard anyway.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Cleric(26), Fighter(12), Monk(2),\u00a0Human, any Lawful\nSTR: 14\nCON: 8\nINT: 8\n\n\n01: Cleric(1): Power Attack, Extend Spell, Domain Magic, Domain Trickery\n03: Cleric(3): Knockdown\n05: Cleric(5)\n07: Cleric(7)\n09: Cleric(9): Weapon Finesse\n11: Cleric(11)\n13: Cleric(13)\n15: Cleric(15): Divine Might\n17: Monk(1): {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}\n19: Fighter(2): Improved Two-Weapon Fighting\n21: Cleric(17): Weapon Focus: Kama\n23: Fighter(5)\n25: Fighter(7)\n27: Cleric(18): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=20)\n29: Cleric(20)\n31: Cleric(22)\n33: Cleric(24): Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=24)\n35: Fighter(9)\n37: Monk(2): {Deflect Arrows}\n39: Fighter(11): Great Dexterity VI, (DEX=27)\n\nSkillpoints: 90\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +1\nAB (max, naked): 38 (melee), 35 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Cleric(9)</details>\n<strong>Similar builds:</strong><br/>\nThe class combination has been used a lot, but I think not with Weapon Finesse, Divine Might and Epic Weapon Specialisation.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I like this build. Love the originality, and I suppose it's a very creative way of making a \"me fight good\" character. That 8 INT is killing me, as I like to access all the content on WoG, and with pretty much no skill points, makes me wonder how much you missed out on during your levelling. But the idea is great.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou forgot to mention that you lose 1 AB on the balanced version, but gain 1 AC that isn't subject to flat-footed loss, as you're swapping a DEX AC point for a WIS AC point. The only problem is that because you need Power Attack, you can't really relinquish any STR points, even though DP will set it to 18 regardless of what the original score is.<br/>\n<br/>\nKudos for the creativity!

You are right that 8 INT is a bummer, but I don't think there is any way around it without sacrificing AB and AC.\u00a0<br/>\nAnd I will concede that the balanced version has a whooping 38 AC when flat-footed, which still means you should just avoid being flat-footed :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<em class=\"mention\">@webshaman1</em>\u00a0<br/>\nAccording to my death log, I never died to Greater Ruin.
