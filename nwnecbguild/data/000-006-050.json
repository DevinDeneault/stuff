But at the time, The child of bhaal slayed every kuo-ta in this place and Moria survived. To survive, Moria prayed the fish god of Darkness and Madness and infused his power. Blibdoulpoulp was seduced by the true madness of Moria. However, Moria has been and always is a good girl, a bit wood-headed, unable to catch the evilness of Blibdoulpoulp.<br/>\nA good girl devoted to an evil mad fish god is, of course, pure nonsense, pure madness. Moria sacrifices evil guys, and only evil guys, to the Supreme Fish (not a mc donald burger). Moria is sneaky, almost invisible, she has to hide from his own god because Blibdoulpoulp doesn\u2019t have to know that Moria do good things in thy name. In fact, Moria wants to keep the power of the Supreme Fish which allows her to (divine) burn backstab his ennemis with two sharpened fisherman knives. <br/>\nBlibdoulpoulp is satsified by the sacrifices, but angry about the goodness of Moria. As a punshment,\u00a0 thy curses Moria\u00a0: she will be very very slow to learn new things.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nThe build\u00a0:<br/>\nFighter(12), Paladin(3), Rogue(25), Elf, Alignment : Loyal Good (level 1-6 ;
