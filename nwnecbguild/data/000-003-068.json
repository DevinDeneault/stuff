\u00a0save(18)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n 1) \u00a0Lingering Song / Curse Song feats. \u00a0I'm not sure about these, as most of the bard levels are going to come so late. \u00a0Maybe extra music and something else instead and just use lich lyrics to burn the songs? \u00a0I'm not sure which feats would be worthwhile if I drop these.<br/>\n<br/>\n 2) \u00a0What to do with the 18 extra skill points that I can't start using until level 18? \u00a0I was thinking I would just boost lore, not sure anything else will be useful that late in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n 3) \u00a0Greatsword good for this build? \u00a0I thought about dropping toughness and the two song feats and dual-wielding shortswords instead ( jergal's sword in SoU :D). \u00a0Not sure which is better. \u00a0I did not want to do sword/shield as I just ran a rogue/fighter/bg through the oc with that setup (although by mid-chapter 2 he was quite powerful). \u00a0I decided to use taunt on this character because my BG got some mileage out of it when he came up on the odd high armor class opponent.<br/>\n<br/>\n 4) \u00a0Any spell suggestions? \u00a0I figured ultravision/darkness might be useful late, especially since darkness and displacement can be cast in armor (before engagement, I plan on just melee with knockdown for casters once the fighting starts). \u00a0Summon Creature I would be for baiting traps (I'm evil after all). \u00a0I'm not really wild about buff spells for the most part. \u00a0Since the bard levels are coming so late I probably won't get too much use out of these.<br/>\n<br/>\n 5) \u00a0Any other suggestions? \u00a0The last time I did SoU and went on to HotU was with a bard / fighter / harper scout and it was a terrible character which is probably why I gave up on HotU so quickly. \u00a0I don't remember SoU being difficult and even that terrible character finished without issues but it seems the difficulty ramps up in HotU.<br/>\n<br/>\n I appreciate any advice. \u00a0I will likely use Dorna/Deekin in SoU and some kind of rogue companion in HotU, given my deficiency of dealing with traps. \u00a0It was funny though, in the OC my BG could open almost any lock and disarm all the traps, by chapter 3 he would just walk through them and bash chests because it was quicker (sooo many chests). \u00a0With evasion he rarely took damage from traps.<i class=\"hide\"

If so, pull from Discipline because your STR cap will more than compensate for the 5 points.<br/>\n<br/>\nMainly I'd focus on scrolls like NegNRG Prot and Shadow Shield to help free up gear slots to cap abilities.\u00a0 You should be able to easily cap STR @46 (+18 * 150%) and perhaps even some +CON wouldn't hurt your HP and Fort saves.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you really prefer a 2H weapon, a Greataxe would look more racially-correct, I suppose.\u00a0 The x3 crits will look impressive when they hit with all that STR.\u00a0 Keened with ImpCrit you'll reach a 17-20 range.<br/>\n<br/>\nElves will have less of a HP pool to stand there and take damage, though.\u00a0 With a 1H weapon and the added shield AC it wouldn't be so bad but you'll be wanting Fort as high as possible against most death-like spells.\u00a0 Mind immunity items abound so Will is not a factor in HotU.\u00a0 The <em>Shield </em>scroll will protect against MM spams.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Afraid I can't remember what level is reachable there, but if you want to get your build all the way up to 40, another mod that follows on from HotU is \"Sands of Fate\" (again, available from the Vault).<br/>\n<br/>\n Regardless, great to have you on board.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

\u00a0I played around with a few things and I came up with a modified build based on the one you posted. \u00a0I wanted to see what you thought before I began playing the character. \u00a0A couple of notes so you don't think I'm particulalry slow:<br/>\n<br/>\n - \u00a0I didn't like delaying the last two RDD levels to epic. \u00a0I know that costs me one BAB from the 9th level of RDD, delaying my 4th attack by one level, and ultimately costing me one attack bonus (at the time I pick up the last RDD level in epic levels). \u00a0I think I would rather have the 4 strength, 1 armor class, and immunities from level 16 on than have one more attack bonus on the last couple of levels that I play this character. \u00a0Too bad I can't scream at my henchmen to cast fireballs at me!<br/>\n<br/>\n - \u00a0I moved the bard levels around to enjoy the spellcraft and tumble bonuses a little more through the life of the character. \u00a0I'm probably not going to get much use out of taunt it appears, unless I give up tumble or spellcraft early instead.<br/>\n<br/>\n - \u00a0I am pretty set on using a big stick, so I moved away from devastating critical since there are no big sticks with extended threat ranges. \u00a0This changed the feat selection a bit. \u00a0I'm not sure if there is more to playing a \"damage adept\" than just taking Great Strength feats at epic levels. \u00a0I looked around the build forums some but I didn't really see high strength builds that didn't select the devastating critical feat. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n In any event the character has improved since my first version, so I thank you for your assistance!
