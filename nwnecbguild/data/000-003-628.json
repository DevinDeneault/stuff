13d6 sneak attack, +10-16 Str damage, +6 WS/EWS damage, +3-9 divine damage if divine might is used, +4-15 flame weapon damage if this is used<br/>\n- Crippling strike for 2 str damage per sneak attack hit making them easier to knockdown again<br/>\n- Devastating critical to potentially kill them if you crit them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you cannot knock them down, UMD or your Blackguard Summons can be used to draw aggression for flanking sneak attacks against non-rogues/barbarians/assassins (flanking sneak attacks are difficult against those classes due to <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Uncanny_dodge\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uncanny Dodge 1.74+</a>).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor tough fights you can set deadly traps before battle, although I never needed to do this as I was so powerful.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce all your opponents were defeated, you had all the rogue skills to deal with remaining problems, such as traps, I used UMD + knock spell to open locks, but if you like you can put points into open lock as a variant.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nOriginally I was interested in boosting the AB to the maximum it could get to (Base 45) however I decided to drop this down a little and boost charisma for extra saves + taunt bonus + divine might for divine damage (against those physical damage resistant opponents) and boost the fort save (against petrify/implosion/dev crit, which there is no immunity) to now finalise the build.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most similar builds are TyrTemplar's The Dark Prince <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build255432.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dev crit version</a> and <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build255434.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">no dev crit version</a>\u00a0which are excellent builds, they have different class splits.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don't want devastating critical or it is disabled in your environment, then drop great cleave, overwhelming critical and devastating critical, for great fortitude, armor skin, and epic fiendish servant / epic toughness / improved sneak attack and take epic prowess as a bonus feat earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would recommend any single handed martial weapon, scimitar has the largest threat range, and keen weapon can be cast on it, meaning it had frequently critically hit but if one wishes to lower the the dev crit frequency then a lesser threat range weapon can be used.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Rogue(13), Fighter(8), Blackguard(19), Human\nSTR: 16 (30)\nCON: 14\nINT: 14\n\n01: Rogue(1): Power Attack, Cleave\n03: Fighter(2): Blind Fight, Expertise\n05: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Scimitar\n07: Rogue(2): {Evasion}\n09: Blackguard(2): Improved Knockdown, {Smite Good}\n11: Blackguard(3)\n13: Blackguard(5)\n15: Blackguard(7): Toughness\n17: Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}\n19: Blackguard(10)\n21: Fighter(8): Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar, Epic Weapon Specialization: Scimitar\n23: Blackguard(11)\n25: Rogue(6)\n27: Rogue(7): Great Strength II, (STR=23)\n29: Blackguard(14)\n31: Blackguard(16): Devastating Critical: Scimitar\n33: Rogue(9): Epic Fortitude\n35: Blackguard(17)\n37: Rogue(12)\n39: Rogue(13): Great Strength V, Slippery Mind, (STR=29)\n\nSkillpoints: 311\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +4, Traps: +2\nAB (max, naked): 43 (melee), 29 (ranged)\nSpell Casting:\u00a0\n\n\n01: Disable Trap(4), Open Lock(1), Search(4), Set Trap(1), Spot(4), UMD(4), Save(26),\u00a0\n03: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(3), Save(24),\u00a0\n05: Discipline(1), Save(32),\u00a0\n07: Disable Trap(3), Hide(5), Search(3), Set Trap(4), Spot(6), Tumble(10), UMD(6), Save(10),\u00a0\n09: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n11: Discipline(1), Taunt(2), Save(11),\u00a0\n13: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(17),\u00a0\n15: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(23),\u00a0\n17: Disable Trap(7), Spot(10), Tumble(10), UMD(10),\u00a0\n19: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n21: Discipline(1), Save(12),\u00a0\n23: Discipline(2), Taunt(4),\u00a0\n25: Disable Trap(1), Spellcraft(5), Spot(1), UMD(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n27: Disable Trap(2), Spot(2), Tumble(5), UMD(2),\u00a0\n29: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n31: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(10),\u00a0\n33: Disable Trap(1), Search(2), Set Trap(3), Spot(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n35: Discipline(4), Taunt(4),\u00a0\n37: Disable Trap(1), Spellcraft(5), Spot(1), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n39: Disable Trap(8), Search(1), Spot(2),\u00a0</details>\nI wish to acknowledge the very significant contributions of Empyre65, Valerfor and Mick Dagger with assisting me with optimizing this build.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I am a fan of CS (no, not Counter Strike this time), especially in strength builds where you don't bother with qualifying for Epic Dodge. If you land some CSs, any strength build will crumble.<br/>\nThe one level of assassin deserves it's place for one extra d6 SA if rogue is on an odd level and there are no bonus feats at the next level for the other classes. I like to take the hit on skillpoints and go for assassin 9 for Improved invisibility and less rogue levels.<br/>\nIf you want an extra feat with a single level, ranger is an alternative to fighter in epic levels.

Rogue 19 / Fighter 2 / Blackguard 19.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt still has 17d6 sneak attack, dev crit, ESF: Taunt, improved knockdown, but also has a ending Str of 34, Base AB 43, crippling strike.<br/>\n<br/>\n450hp and armor skin combined with improved evasion and tower shield should provide enough defensive capabilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nTook the fighter levels epic to add more epic feats allowing me to take 7 great strengths.<br/>\n<br/>\nI put set trap to 15 modified but in environments where One with the land is easily accessible then set trap 11 can work, but I recall most single player modules will have trouble with accessing that spell via scrolls (haven't played a single player module for a while now...)<br/>\n<br/>\nDropped Int from 14 to 13 and Cha to 10 to get the Str up.

Light armor, no shield and negative dex for a melee build was tough work! The only way I managed it was cheesy UMD stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nSneak attack dropped down to 13d6 but the +6 damage / hit and higher AB I think more than compensates.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI do like high sneak attack numbers though and it was tempting to use the bonus rogue feats for improved sneak attack instead.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nTyrTemplar has a build with a slightly different split (R10F8B22 - <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build255434.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/buil ... 55434.html</a>) and goes Divine Might / Shield and has 12d6 sneak attack rather than 13d6. I would also do some tweaks of Tyr's build if I was playing it, for example take rogue at level 1 for a whole pile of extra skill points, maybe get the rogue levels at 7 / 17 pre epic for the tumble dumps ASAP (that +1AC does make a difference).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, what do you think? Thanks so much for the very helpful comments<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Edit:</strong>\u00a0I also squeezed in a 'Resist Energy' feat to keep Agardis happy, that feat needs some love! (It also stacks with equipment). I figured a demonic evil blackguard would definitely be resistant to fire, but acid is a good choice too!<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Rogue(13), Blackguard(19), Fighter(8), Human\nSTR: 18 (34)\nCON: 14\nINT: 14\n\n01: Rogue(1): Blind Fight, Power Attack\n03: Fighter(2): Cleave, Expertise\n05: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialisation (Scimitar)\n07: Rogue(2): {Evasion}\n09: Blackguard(1): Improved Critical (Scimitar)\n11: Blackguard(3)\n13: Blackguard(5)\n15: Blackguard(7): Resist Energy (Fire)\n17: Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}\n19: Blackguard(10)\n21: Fighter(8): Epic Weapon Focus (Scimitar), Epic Weapon Specialisation (Scimitar)\n23: Blackguard(11)\n25: Blackguard(13): Overwhelming Critical (Scimitar)\n27: Rogue(5): Great Strength, (STR=26)\n29: Blackguard(16): Devastating Critical (Scimitar)\n31: Rogue(7)\n33: Blackguard(17): Great Strength, (STR=30)\n35: Rogue(10): Crippling Strike\n37: Rogue(11)\n39: Rogue(13): Great Strength, Improved Evasion, (STR=33)\n\nSkillpoints: 311\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +2, Traps: +2\nAB (max, naked): 45 (melee), 29 (ranged)\nSpell Casting:\u00a0\n\n\n01: Disable Trap(4), Hide(4), Listen(4), Open Lock(1), Search(4), Set Trap(4), UMD(4), Save(19),\u00a0\n03: Discipline(1), Save(23),\u00a0\n05: Discipline(1), Save(31),\u00a0\n07: Disable Trap(6), Hide(1), Listen(6), Search(4), Set Trap(6), Tumble(10), UMD(6), Save(7),\u00a0\n09: Discipline(1), Taunt(12), Save(2),\u00a0\n11: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(8),\u00a0\n13: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(14),\u00a0\n15: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(20),\u00a0\n17: Disable Trap(10), Set Trap(4), Tumble(10), UMD(10),\u00a0\n19: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n21: Discipline(1), Save(12),\u00a0\n23: Discipline(2), Taunt(4), Save(1),\u00a0\n25: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(7),\u00a0\n27: Disable Trap(5), Listen(6), Tumble(5), UMD(5),\u00a0\n29: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n31: Disable Trap(1), Listen(3), Search(7),\u00a0\n33: Discipline(4), Taunt(4),\u00a0\n35: Disable Trap(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(3), Save(3),\u00a0\n37: Disable Trap(2), Listen(2), Tumble(5), Save(4),\u00a0\n39: Disable Trap(1), Listen(1), Search(9), Save(3),\u00a0</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
