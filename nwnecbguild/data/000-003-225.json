      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hey all! I was trying to think up of another character for an RP server, and I had the bright idea of a cleric of Mask. My goal is to be a melee \"scrapper\" who can heal,\u00a0stealth, scout, and handle locks/traps if need be. Essentially a \"jack of all trades\". It'll be great if I build it right, and fall flat on its face if I don't.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cleric is going to be the primary class for the build, with Rogue a second for the loads of skillpoints and fitting Mask flavor-wise. I'm struggling somewhat between Shadowdancer and Assassin for the third classes-- Assassin brings neat Invisibility and death attacks\u00a0to the table,\u00a0but\u00a0Shadowdancer has HiPS. Something to note is that my server restricts single-level dips--I\u00a0have to take at least three levels of a class, so I can't just take one level of SD and call it a build.\u00a0Alternately, if there's another possibility I'm overlooking for a third class, please tell me! Since Darkness and Luck didn't make it into the game, Trickery and Evil will be the domains chosen for proper roleplay purposes. I'm happy about Trickery, not so thrilled about Evil, but ce la vie.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'll be going DEX-based and foregoing heavy armor, though I'm not sure whether I'll do dual-wielding or use a light shield, because\u00a0I don't know if I prefer the extra attack over the extra AC yet. The weapon needs to be finessable, obviously, and I don't really have a preference as to what it is. No DM/DS, since I have to dump CHA for DEX/INT/WIS.<br/>\n<br/>\n A (very) rough sketch:<br/>\n<br/>\n Human or Half-Elf, NE<br/>\n (Cleric/Rogue/???)

I'd still like to play around with the skills and classes, but that's a really good base. Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n So what I'm looking at, as build options, are Mick's suggested Cleric 24/Rogue 16, Cleric 24/Rogue 11/Assassin 5, or Cleric 24/Rogue 11/Shadowdancer 5.<br/>\n<br/>\n Going off the class progression tables (ie, without laying everything out, ie going by an estimate), Cleric 24/Rogue 11/Assassin 5 gets me 3d6 death attack, Darkness, Ghostly Visage, Use Poison, and costs me 20 skillpoints, 2d6 sneak attack, two bonus feats, and 1 BAB.\u00a0Cleric 24/Rogue 11/Shadowdancer 5 gets me HiPS, darkvision, and the shadow daze/summon shadow/shadow evade abilities, while costing me 10 skillpoints, 2d6 sneak attack, 1 BAB, and a bonus feat. Shadowdancer 5 gets Defensive Roll, which negates the loss of one of the bonus feats.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thoughts?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

But the claim doesn't preclude any restrictions (such as taking a minimum of 3 levels of each class). \u00a0Cleric 23 Rogue 13 Fighter 4 is better than this build, but since it's RP, Mick's build is quite good.<br/>\n<br/>\n Apocrypha, look for a topic called Black Flame Zealot in this section. I posted a Cleric 15 / Fighter 6 / Rogue 19, which is also a very good option for you to consider. Both spreads that you spoke about are bad. No reason for Rogue 11, no reason for Assassin 5. You can either take Mick's build, which is very good for RP, even if it has only 2 classes, or put 4 levels of Fighter for 3 extra feats and access to Epic Weapon Specialization to help with damage at the expense of 5% dispellability, one Rogue bonus feat, 1d6 SA damage and a few skill points (but free weapon proficiencies).<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Fighter 4 is a neat suggestion, but I'm gonna pass because a) it doesn't quite fit RP, and b) it'll give me an XP penalty, but I'll make a note about the possibility when I post the build proper (which should be either tonight or tomorrow morning).<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks for the help, everyone!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The price would be later cleric development, dispellable buffs, no crippling strike, and 20% xp penalty throughout many levels.
