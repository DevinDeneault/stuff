By my calculations he can end at a Dual-wielding 45 AB and STR 24/ CON 22 with EDR 3, as a human still. Just throwing some ideas to the table here.</div>"

      "content": "<div>He, he thank you Val', I really enjoy playing this character. He's a real grinder. And If I feel he needs more AC he can both grab a shield and activate Expertise. I always stack up with clarity potions to handle his low will save, and then everything is OK. Vs mages he wears down premonition/stoneskins in a round or two, and as long as he has some kind of enchantment on his Kukris that gives a minimum of elemental or other damage, he can land his Knockdowns and keep the mages stalled until they are dead meat. I have even worn down Epic warding that way, but that took a couple more rounds.   <br/>\nEDR feats are possible. <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build254647.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Forest Outlaw Staff Master - Fighter 12/Rogue 3/WM 25 by EROMB</a> does just that. It is not geared towards dual wielding with a dexterity of 14. But it ends with a constitution of 22, so maybe there is room for a tweak if you start with Strength 15, Dexterity 15 and Constitution 15. You have to remove  PA, Cleave, Great cleave, Disarm and Improved disarm to have WP exotic, all three dual wield feats and Blind fight. Of course you also have to change weapon focus to Kukri.</div>",

Since kukris are tiny weapons and thus eligible for dual-wield even for small races you could go with Halfling too. Start with: (Str 15 Dex 15 Con 14 Int 14 Wis 08 Cha 08) and take the extra Great Str feat iin place of Esf: Spot, you will lose also the spot skill since you won't have that many skill points as a Human does but you will gain +1 AB/ +1 AC/ +1 To all Saves. Not that you desperately need another point of AB in this build exactly, but it's something that cross my mind and i just wanted to point it out. Anyway he is a great blender no matter how do you look at him!</div>"
