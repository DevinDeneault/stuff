      "content": "<div>Many years ago, I had fun using the toolset to form items which would make any character OP. This time, using the Pretty Good Character Creator, I\u2019d like to create items which would guarantee any character 100% impervious to damage and death. I know that it\u2019s boring when used in single player modules, but at times I\u2019d like to see bosses like Halaster get beaten by a lvl 1 bard soloing Infinite Dungeons. So these are what I thought are the essential item properties:<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nDamage Immunity: Acid 100% Immunity Bonus<br/>\nDamage Immunity: Bludgeoning 100% Immunity Bonus<br/>\nDamage Immunity: Cold 100% Immunity Bonus<br/>\nDamage Immunity: Divine 100% Immunity Bonus<br/>\nDamage Immunity: Electrical 100% Immunity Bonus<br/>\nDamage Immunity: Fire 100% Immunity Bonus<br/>\nDamage Immunity: Magical 100% Immunity Bonus<br/>\nDamage Immunity: Negative Energy 100% Immunity Bonus<br/>\nDamage Immunity: Piercing 100% Immunity Bonus<br/>\nDamage Immunity: Positive Energy 100% Immunity Bonus<br/>\nDamage Immunity: Slashing 100% Immunity Bonus<br/>\nDamage Immunity: Sonic 100% Immunity Bonus<br/>\nImmunity: Critical Hits<br/>\nImmunity: Death Magic<br/>\nImmunity: Fear<br/>\nImmunity: Level/ability drain<br/>\nImmunity: Poison<br/>\nSpell Immunity: Breath, Petrification<br/>\nSpell Immunity: Flesh to Stone<br/>\nSpell Immunity: Gaze, Petrification<br/>\nSpell Immunity: Implosion<br/>\nSpell Immunity: Touch, Petrification</div>"

      "content": "<div>Nice list. God mode in Infinite Dungeons.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway to be helpful consider adding:<br/>\nImmunity: Mind-affecting (I believe fear and Mind Affecting are different)<br/>\nImmunity: Ability/Level Drain<br/>\nFreedom<br/>\nImmunity: Critical Hit (for devastating critical opponents who might instantly kill you despite all your protections)<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider replace Spell Immunity: Implosion with:<br/>\nImmunity: Level 9 spells or less (I think this property exists)<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider immunity to poison/disease but Ability/Level Drain should cover that mostly. I believe there might be a poison/disease or two that might have a fortitude save or die.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegeneration is handy to have just in case you do take damage LOL although your defences look pretty water tight to me.</div>"

It could cause an equipped armor or shield to be unequipped or destroyed, depending on the module.</div>"

What I came up is a near-invincible build that could deal damage across 12 damage types, cast all insta-kill spells, inflict devastating critical hits, and strip enemies of armor, shield or weapon, or steal items from their inventory:<br/>\n<br/>\nS29 RDD10 B1<br/>\nHuman, TN<br/>\nSTR 18 (26)<br/>\nDEX 8<br/>\nCON 8 (10)<br/>\nWIS 8<br/>\nINT 12 (14)<br/>\nCHA 16 (32)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHP: 206<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fort/Will/Ref): 20/23/15<br/>\nBAB: 22<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 24 (melee), 21 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked): 16<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nSkillpoints: 200<br/>\nConcentration \u00a034(34), Disable trap 1(3), Discipline 43(61), Lore 8(10), Open lock 1(0), Pick pocket 38(37), Set trap 1(0), Spellcraft 2(4), Taunt 43(54), Tumble 25(24), UMD 1(12)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n1 S1: PA, Cleave<br/>\n2 S2<br/>\n3 S3: Blind fight<br/>\n4 S4: CHA +1(17)<br/>\n5 S5<br/>\n6 RDD1: WF: Morningstar<br/>\n7 RDD2: STR=20<br/>\n8 RDD3: CHA +1(18)<br/>\n9 RDD4: Empower Spell, STR=22<br/>\n10 RDD5<br/>\n11 RDD6<br/>\n12 RDD7: GC, CON=10, CHA +1(19)<br/>\n13 RDD8<br/>\n14 RDD9: INT=14<br/>\n15 S6: Disarm<br/>\n16 S7: CHA +1(20)<br/>\n17 S8<br/>\n18 S9: IC: Morningstar<br/>\n19 S10<br/>\n20 RDD10: STR=26, CHA +1(23)<br/>\n21 S11: OC: Morningstar<br/>\n22 S12<br/>\n23 S13<br/>\n24 S14: DC: Morningstar, CHA +1(24)<br/>\n25 S15<br/>\n26 S16<br/>\n27 S17: ESF: Discipline<br/>\n28 S18: CHA +1(25)<br/>\n29 S19<br/>\n30 S20: Improved Disarm<br/>\n31 S21<br/>\n32 S22: CHA +1(26)<br/>\n33 S23: EWF: Morningstar, GR CHA I(27)<br/>\n34 S24<br/>\n35 S25<br/>\n36 S26: Epic Prowess, GR CHA II, CHA +1(29)<br/>\n37 S27<br/>\n38 S28<br/>\n39 S29: GR CHA IV(31)<br/>\n40 B1: CHA +1(32)<br/>\n<br/>\nSpells:<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 0: Acid Splash, Daze, Electric Jolt, Ray of Frost, Flare<br/>\nLevel 1: Burning Hands, Ice Dagger, Magic Missile, Negative Energy Ray, Horizikaul\u2019s Boom<br/>\nLevel 2: Death Armor, Melf\u2019s Acid Arrow, Combust, Eagle\u2019s Splendor, Bull\u2019s Strength<br/>\nLevel 3: Scintillating Sphere, Mestil\u2019s Acid Breath, Negative Energy Burst, Flame Arrow], Haste<br/>\nLevel 4: Phantasmal Killer, Enervation, Elemental Shield, Ice Storm<br/>\nLevel 5: Mestil\u2019s Acid Sheath, Cloudkill, Firebrand, Cone of Cold<br/>\nLevel 6: Flesh to Stone, Isaac's Greater Missile Storm, Chain Lightning<br/>\nLevel 7: Finger of Death, Prismatic Spray, Delayed Blast Fireball<br/>\nLevel 8: Bigby\u2019s Clenched Fist, Incendiary Cloud, Horrid Wilting<br/>\nLevel 9: Time Stop, Mordenkainen\u2019s Disjunction, Black Blade of Disaster<br/>\n<br/>\nEquipment:<br/>\nHelmet: immunity to negative and positive energy<br/>\nBelt: immunity to bludgeoning and slashing<br/>\nCloak: immunity to\u00a0piercing and critical hit<br/>\nAmulet: immunity to\u00a0acid and electrical<br/>\nBoots: immunity to\u00a0cold, death magic,petrification breath and petrification gaze<br/>\nGauntlet: immunity to\u00a0divine, implosion, petrification touch and level/ability drain<br/>\nRing: immunity to\u00a0magical, flesh to stone and poison<br/>\nRing: immunity to\u00a0sonic and mind-affecting<br/>\nRobe: true seeing, freedom, +1 CHA, +5 STR, immunity to\u00a0silence<br/>\nShield: -30% spell failure, -25% spell failure, haste, +4 CHA, immunity to\u00a0knockdown<br/>\nMorningstar: on hit cast level 2 ruin armor<br/>\nMorningstar: on hit cast\u00a0level 2 implosion<br/>\nMorningstar: on hit cast\u00a0level 2 weird<br/>\nMorningstar: on hit cast\u00a0level 2 energy drain<br/>\nMorningstar: on hit cast\u00a0level 2 destruction<br/>\nMorningstar: +1d6 positive damage<br/>\nMorningstar: +1d6 divine\u00a0damage<br/>\nMorningstar: +1d6 sonic\u00a0damage<br/>\nMorningstar: +1d6 negative\u00a0damage<br/>\nMorningstar: +1d6 acid\u00a0damage<br/>\nMorningstar: +1d4 cold\u00a0damage<br/>\nMorningstar: +1d4 electrical\u00a0damage<br/>\nMorningstar: +1d4 magical\u00a0damage<br/>\nMorningstar, Sickle, Sling, Bullets, Darts<br/>\nMiscellaneous Small: continual flame x3/day, eagle\u2019s splendor x5/day, slay living x1/day; unlimited spells (bull\u2019s strength, flame twin, flame weapon, lesser dispel, true strike)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nTotal item cost: 4,360,000 GP<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nNotable weaknesses:\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThis build is not immune to disarm and ruin armor: but these are mitigated by assigning non-essential properties on armor, shield and weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also vulnerable to creature attacks (e.g. beholder special attacks) for which immunity cannot be provided by items.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nIt is not immune to immobilization caused by spells Bigby 7 and 9.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding offense, it suffers from low AB and low DC of spells, although this wouldn\u2019t be much of an issue if playing in an environment where one is limited by total item cost. While it is not immune to taunt and spells that cause deafness, its shield will nullify all spell failure.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnemies with SR above 32 (or above 22 with immunity to Mordenkainen's Disjunction) are immune to on hit cast level 2 spells from weapons.\u00a0Enemies who would otherwise be vulnerable to damage but is regenerating more than 16 HP will negate all damage at the end of each round, from a 1d4 weapon wielded by a character with four attacks per round.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nFeel free to comment on the build, I\u2019ll appreciate it.</div>"
