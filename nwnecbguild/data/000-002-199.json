I work on Open Office and that works just fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Guild Filter is a spreadsheet with basic stats for every completed build from this site on it and a url to connect you to each one. So you can search by class, race, alignment, number of levels, builder, pretty much anything. Iirc, there are about 300 builds there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Legacy Archives lets you search all the thousands of builds from the old ECB, which was before my time, but has still led me to unearthing some hidden gems from days of yore (Grizzled Dwarflord's Hearth Guard is a particular favourite of mine).<br/>\n<br/>\nGo on, you know you want to...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Stag's advice is as usual a sound one, you need to DL the Legacy Archives at some point which has the traditional filter for builds with all the builds of the old ECB.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, the search here is also good. What you need to do is put the keyword normally in the white box and then select the option \"search topic titles only\" from down below. Doing that for example with the keyword \"Cleric/Wizard\" will now find you only three answers. It will still show the html code below but just above it will be the Topic's Title, just click on it and you go to the thread.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Speedy Sniper\" by Max, was one of the answers for that particular search.<br/>\n=&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=2335699&amp;p=478&amp;hilit=Cleric%2FWizard#p478\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=2335699&amp;p=478&amp;hilit ... izard#p478</a><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

(I like them dark-coloured myself).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that's out of the way, here is how i use them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nStep A. Open up your Epic Character Builders folder and inside it you will find three seperate folders named \"Builds\", \"Builds Search\" and \"Images\".<br/>\nStep B. Open up your \"<strong>Builds Search</strong>\" folder and inside it you find some stuff. Ignore them all apart from the \"<strong>ECB_search.html</strong>\". Click on that and it opens a seperate page in your browser with the old search engine.<br/>\nStep C. Enjoy!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

And this from someone who has only just learned how to spell teknolojie, so it must be alright.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, beers will help.

So...<br/>\n<br/>\nI go to wherever I've parked the download - in my case, the F drive, then I click on the ECB builds xls file. It opens (you don't have to be on the internet to do this). I then see a spreadsheet of some 280 listed builds. I look for the sort of attributes I want to look for, then, when I've narrowed it down I go to each build's URL (listed and clickable) and click on one. That opens that particular build on this forum like magic. I look at it. If it's not quite right for me, I close it and that takes me back to the spreadsheet, etc, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot very helpful perhaps, but the best I can do, as one of similar tech-aversion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, of course washing down aspirin down with beers is ok...is there another way of taking them?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I can not get it to work with chrome.)<br/>\n<br/>\nTo choose the right file it helps to make sure you are able to view file extensions. If you can't see file extensions, google how to do that.
