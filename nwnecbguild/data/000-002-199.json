      "content": "<div>Hi all! <br/>\nIt's my second playthrough of the Swordflight series, and I've played it with a gnome spellsword. <br/>\nNow, as we all know, the small stature implies that:<br/>\n<blockquote><div>Because they are so small, they cannot use the following weapons: dire mace, two-bladed sword, double axe, greataxe, greatsword, halberd, heavy flail, quarterstaff, scythe, and spear.\u00a0 <em>(Nwnwiki)</em></div></blockquote>\n\nToday I obtained a powerful halberd, and I was preparing to sell it...but...I noticed that if I selected the item, the game showed only a white halo, and not a red halo.....could it be that my small gnome could wield, with his own hands, the big bad halberd?<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course she does!<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/201712/10714033_055b5414f1ea055ec66be4422970543c.png\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI quickly went to the smithy and I discovered that the same can be applied for a spear, hence these weapons seem an exception (not mentioned in the wiki).<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/201712/10714033_c8398b5bdee5efd03f1d8e1aa09ae666.png\"/><br/>\n<br/>\nIs that a bug in the game? I tried to search somewhere in this new and the old ecb guilds, but found nothing...</div>"

That's because my little Nathee, at the really beginning of the original campaign (gave it a try now), when you have to buy your weapon, there is a white/fading green halo on both the halberd and the spear.<br/>\nBought the two of them and she can handle them, of course with both hands. <span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83d\ude42</span><br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be perfect if someone could confirm it, but on the basis of all the evidence it seems that there are really exceptions to the weapons that can't be wielded by little creatures.</div>"
