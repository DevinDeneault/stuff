      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">I figured it appropriate to place the two links together away from the main activity for safe-keeping.\u00a0 These are the respective locations of The Krit's archive of both the Epic and Pre-epic Character Build submissions from the now-defunct Bioware Guild and Registry:<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/other/epic-character-builders\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Character Builds</a></strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/other/pre-epic-character-builds\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pre-epic Character Builds</a></strong><br/>\n<br/>\n In both cases, decompressing the associated zip will create 3 folders.\u00a0 By navigating to the applicable search html in the <em>buildsearch </em>folder and opening it in a browser with javascript enabled, the familiar search screen will appear matching the server-side utility (currently unhosted).\u00a0 Filenames: Epic - <strong>ECB_search.html</strong>, Pre-epic - <strong>PECB_search.html\u00a0</strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n There are also some other interesting html lists you may want to access within the <em>builds</em> folder that contain links to general discussions and guides. You will notice that the <em>data (</em>or<em> data0) </em>subfolder contains all the individual topics in html (the main data storage folder) but the files in the <em>builds </em>section contain the list of topics as an index making it easy to navigate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Final Note</strong>:\u00a0 Until the search utility has been rehosted, I suggest that if builders would like to reference one of the legacy builds they simply furnish enough of a description that would make it easy for any member to find using their local copy of the archive search.\u00a0 Towards that end... please supply the build's<strong> title</strong>, <strong>class split</strong> and <strong>author</strong>.<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Hip's lead post was back in 2015, before the Greyhawk site became available elsewhere, and was meant as a stop-gap. It's now defunkt, unless you'd already downloaded it, which I had, and it still works, so I missed the change when tidying things up. Sorry DPA, and anyone else who's been struggling of late.<br/>\n<br/>\nMarvellous - more housekeeping!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
