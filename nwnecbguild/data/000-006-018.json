He was a savage, wild, strong and pretty smart little gnome, in love with mother Nature and deep forests, a strange way of life for a gnome. As a young gnome, he was always singing in honor of Nature, alone in wild and dark forests, sometimes fighting wild animals to survive, with a rusty scimitar he was holding whit his two little but strong hands.<br/>\nOne day, as he was singing in the woods, he heard agressive voices next to him. Another gnome, with a wise and strange appearance, was attacked by rogues. As Jukip was helping the other gnome, this one shapeshifted into a huge old green dragon and melted the rogues. \u00ab\u00a0The Gnome\u00a0\u00bb was \u00ab\u00a0Two souls\u00a0\u00bb, the wisest creature of the forest, a semi god, a dragon\u00a0: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/two-souls-the-judges-wizard-25-druid-5-shifter-10-t2356051.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">two-souls-the-judges-wizard-25-druid-5- ... 56051.html</a><br/>\nBoth gnomes become blood brothers, and Two souls shared his draconic blood and power to Jukip. Those friends were, at the moment, the most powerful creatures of the gnomish world.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Explanations of the build / questions\u00a0:</span><br/>\n<br/>\nIdea of the build\u00a0: to get a great and soon dev. crit with a two-handed weapon (to make massive damages against crit immunes) with a good crit. range and a very good dev. crit. DC after buffing / debuffing.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon\u2019t you loose some power for RP purpose by choosing a Gnome\u00a0? <br/>\n<br/>\nI don\u2019t think so, you only looses two strenght points, but you gain somme advantages. Small stature (+1 AB + 1 AC), bonus to listen, training against some creatures, and the cheese on this build\u00a0: you use a scimitar as a two-handed weapon, so you get a two handed weapon with a high strenght (+50% strenght damages) with a better criticial range (18 \u2013 20) than any normal two-handed weapon (with access to imp. crit. and keen age).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy don\u2019t you replace Curse Song by blind fight\u00a0? Why not to go 16 bard and 14 barbarian\u00a0?<br/>\n<br/>\nCurse song is a core feat to this build, since you try to get the best dev. crit. DC, a 15 levels bard song is perfect since you get a debuff of 2 fort saves.<br/>\n15 bard / 15 Barb is the perfect balance in this build\u00a0: you are able to debuff the fort. Saves of 4 points with your curse song and your terrifying rage (barbarian level required\u00a0: 15). You loose the bard 6th level of spells and the sweet level 16 song, but for the purpose of the build, it\u2019s not necessary. And I don\u2019t really like the 6th level spells of the bard, not the best to me.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">The build</span><br/>\n<br/>\nTested PvM 1 -40<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nBard(15), Barbarian(15), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Gnome<br/>\nTrue Neutral<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nSTR: 16 (34)<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 12 (14)<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 14 (16)<br/>\nCHA: 14 (16)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nGnome: (Defensive Training vs. Giants, Hardiness vs. Enchantments, Low-light Vision, Offensive Training vs. Goblinoids, Offensive Training vs. Reptilians, Skill Affinity: Concentration, Skill Affinity: Listen, Small Stature, Spell Focus: Illusion)<br/>\n01: Bard(1): Armor Proficiency Heavy<br/>\n02: Barbarian(1)<br/>\n03: Barbarian(2): Weapon Focus: Scimitar, {Uncanny Dodge I}<br/>\n04: Bard(2): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n05: Barbarian(3)<br/>\n06: Red Dragon Disciple(1): Power Attack<br/>\n07: Bard(3)<br/>\n08: Red Dragon Disciple(2): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n09: Red Dragon Disciple(3): Cleave<br/>\n10: Red Dragon Disciple(4): (STR=22)<br/>\n11: Barbarian(4)<br/>\n12: Bard(4): STR+1, Improved Critical: Scimitar, (STR=23)<br/>\n13: Red Dragon Disciple(5)<br/>\n14: Red Dragon Disciple(6)<br/>\n15: Bard(5): Curse Song<br/>\n16: Red Dragon Disciple(7): STR+1, (STR=24), (CON=14)<br/>\n17: Red Dragon Disciple(8)<br/>\n18: Barbarian(5): Great Cleave<br/>\n19: Barbarian(6)<br/>\n20: Bard(6): STR+1, (STR=25)<br/>\n21: Red Dragon Disciple(9): Overwhelming Critical: Scimitar, (INT=16)<br/>\n22: Red Dragon Disciple(10): {Darkvision}, (STR=29), (CHA=16)<br/>\n23: Bard(7)<br/>\n24: Barbarian(7): STR+1, Devastating Critical: Scimitar, (STR=30)<br/>\n25: Barbarian(8)<br/>\n26: Bard(8)<br/>\n27: Bard(9): Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br/>\n28: Barbarian(9): STR+1, (STR=31)<br/>\n29: Barbarian(10)<br/>\n30: Bard(10): Armor Skin<br/>\n31: Barbarian(11)<br/>\n32: Bard(11): STR+1, (STR=32)<br/>\n33: Barbarian(12): Epic Prowess<br/>\n34: Bard(12)<br/>\n35: Barbarian(13)<br/>\n36: Bard(13): STR+1, Epic Skill Focus: Intimidate, (STR=33)<br/>\n37: Bard(14)<br/>\n38: Barbarian(14)<br/>\n39: Barbarian(15): Terrifying Rage<br/>\n40: Bard(15): STR+1, (STR=34)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHitpoints: 434<br/>\nSkillpoints: 257<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 25/22/18<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +6, Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +3<br/>\nBAB: 26<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 43 (melee), 27 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane plate/with undispellable buffs and debuffs): 24/32/38<br/>\nSpell Casting: Bard(5)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nEDIT : bard song bonuses ; curse song debuff / AC 4, AB 2, damages 3, saves +2, HP +16, skills + 3<br/>\n<br/>\nWith song buff and debuffs, spell buffs and taunt, the AB\u00a0 could be very high<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIntimidate 42(55), Listen 43(48), Lore 9(27), Perform 21(24), Spellcraft 27(30), Taunt 43(46), Tumble 40(39), UMD 32(35)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>\n01: Listen(4), Lore(4), Perform(4), Taunt(4), UMD(3), Save(5), \n03: Listen(1), Lore(1), Taunt(1), Save(11), \n05: Listen(1), Lore(1), Taunt(1), Save(9), \n07: Listen(1), Perform(3), Taunt(2), Tumble(5), UMD(5), Save(2), \n09: Listen(1), Save(8), \n11: Listen(1), Taunt(4), Save(12), \n13: Listen(1), Save(4), \n15: Listen(1), Perform(3), Taunt(3), UMD(5), Save(1), \n17: Save(9), \n19: Intimidate(3), Listen(1), Taunt(1), Save(8), \n21: Listen(1), Save(3), \n23: Listen(1), Taunt(3), Tumble(5), Save(5), \n25: Intimidate(5), Listen(1), Taunt(1), \n27: Listen(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(5), \n29: Intimidate(5), Listen(1), Taunt(1), \n31: Intimidate(4), Listen(1), Taunt(1), Save(1), \n33: Intimidate(2), Listen(1), Taunt(1), Save(3), \n35: Intimidate(2), Listen(1), Taunt(1), Save(3), \n37: Listen(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(5), \n39: Intimidate(1), Listen(1), Taunt(1), Save(6), </details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">This build reminds me of the Blade Juggernaut by cdaulepp, it kind of never ends with the next level always bringing something to the table. It truly is a level forty build but not in a bad way that it is unplayable before that but instead that it feels complete at that level. In terms of raw power, it is a monster. Defences are not in the same high standard but this is mainly an offensive toon, a fun character to be enjoyed &amp; one of the rare strong shorties around. I'm commenting on your Min/Max version by the way. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I wanted to mention is the ESF: Intimidate<br/>\n<br/>\nNormally, we put this on Barbarians with a modified skill of 43(41) to make them truly effective, but in this case, your <strong>minimum </strong>Terrifying Rage DC is: 51 (42 ranks +3 Charisma +5 Bard Song +1 minimum roll) &amp; thus is not needed in my opinion. Feel free to take one of Lingering Song/ Extend Spell/ Blind-Fight in your build in place of that. Ideally, you need all of these feats but alas one cannot have everything in a build...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: Oh, I forgot! You might want to change the build's title a bit so that it includes the level split as well.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
