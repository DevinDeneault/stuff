I was originally making him with a Dwarven Waraxe, so Called Shot was actually Weapon Proficiency Exotic, which wasn't droppable back then. But then playing on WoG, Dwarven Waraxes there are shyt, so I decided to change. That modification is purely server-oriented, because of Arbas' Sunderer and Scar the Inquisitor's Hammer of Thunderbolts, which ROCKS! I should probably post a more general version of it with the dwarven waraxe as originally intended and take off my WoG glasses for a bit <br/>\n<br/>\nGreatsword wouldn't be bad either. King Snurre's Chaos Fire comes to mind ^^<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Think UMD right from the start and possibly some trap skills. And remember you can buy custom weapons from the DM on WoG. Just a thought.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I gotta get the hang of using traps, never really got into it. Will do it with my Bane Crusher build, which I will repost here sometime soon. But it's a non-self-buffer with 42 AB, which is kinda bad. It'll end up with an effective AB of 53 with Capped STR and +5 GMW without dropping 1 BAB as you suggested, which would make it the lowest AB build I have ever concocted . Well, not really, but the lowest AB melee-oriented build I have ever come up with. I know the purpose is to just soak damage, but I would like to see ways of enhancing that abysmal score without dropping CON and EDR, not drop it any further. I don't really suffer with playability all that much. Moathouse, TOEE, Hill Giant Steading, Dragon Cult, and then Critwall from 18 on and Fire Giants and WDK after 35 is sort of my \"route\" in WoG, with the occasional Duergar Caves, Cyclops and Hugo once. I find I can solo it just fine with just about any toon I have played. Do you think I can get my hands on Divine Favor wands with 15 caster levels?? That would really be handy: 58 AB ain't that bad. Would be my second lowest AB build then <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
