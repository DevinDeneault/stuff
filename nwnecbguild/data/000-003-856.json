      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hello Ketsu!<br/>\nLet me just assure you, you are not in the wrong forum. <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, let me get this right. You want an elf, a sneaker with HIPS that can solo. <br/>\nYou want Katana and strength based, but you also want DM and some charisma<br/>\nAnd you want to build with Rogue, Shadowdancer and Blackguard.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically this is a \"Fighter/Rogue\" type build. But you complicate things a little bit with Divine Might and Charisma. You also want two classes in there that both need 2 feats to qualify; Dodge and Mobility for SD and Power attack and Cleave for BG. There is a small synergy since you also need Power attack for Divine might, but the build will be very feat starved, especially since you also want an exotic weapon. <br/>\nIt is possible though. Your pre epic feats will be Dodge, Mobility, Power attack, Cleave, Weapon proficiency exotic, Weapon focus Katana and Divine Might. And that is all you get.<br/>\n<br/>\nStarting out with a strength based build, you cannot afford a high dexterity. Even if you max out the stealth skills, they will not be impressive until you can afford some epic skill focus feats to boost them. Stealth will even be worse once you get access to, and start using heavy armor from Blackguard. But the most difficult part will be your low AC during the first levels due to the low dexterity and only access to light armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best (pre epic) BAB you can get with these classes is +17. It is possible to get a final strength of 32 with an AB of 42 and still get a Charisma of 16, but then either your Constitution will suffer with consequently low hitpoints, or your Intelligence with less skills. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo you are in a squeeze with a build like this. It can be done, but it will never be great. It will be hard to level up early on, but it can be fairly all right later if you can live with the shortcomings. What you finally get is a good amount of Sneak damage and consistent strength based damage.\u00a0 The divine damage is hard to resist and the saves are better than the average Fighter/Rogue. HIPS will probably save your life more than once, once you get it.<br/>\nSometimes I play builds like this just for the challenge of it, but I don't recommend it to anybody.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Going with human &amp; longsword (or another martial weapon) will make this slightly more tolerable.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Free Cleave and IKD, and you could go either kama or fist for Monk APR. Natural AC bumps and speed. And you get to keep Evasion and Imp Evasion, as well as stealth skills, Tumble and better saves. Admittedly, you'd be fighting in robes and sneaks would be somewhat buggered (technical term), but I just wondered...<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">A few idle musings, if I may...<br/>\n<br/>\nGoing Dex-based will indeed help AC (assuming you won't be going heavy armour), but it won't help with the feat starvation - you'll simply be replacing Exotic Weapon Proficiency for Weapon Finesse (presumably rapier if going for elf). And you'll be more reliant on sneak attacks, or your damage will be pretty sucky (another technical term).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you wanted to replace Rogue and maintain Uncanny Dodge (much more important in a Dex build, obvs) before SD2 kicks in, Barbarian is your only option, 'cause you can't take 3 prestige classes. Of course, there are pluses and minuses to Barb over Rogue. You get full BAB, Rage, 10% extra speed, and martial weapons, but you lose access to UMD, total number of skill points, stealth and Tumble (manageable once you get SD), reliance on BG for sneaks, and no Epic Dodge unless you take at least 10 levels of SD.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I'm not sure whether a change to a Dex focus - with or without Rogue - would be beneficial or not. Sorry to play the party-pooper!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
