is necessary).<br/>\nSome might prefer take 2 Great Dexterity and lose ESF Hide and another feat.<br/>\nPre-epics are, again, probably a matter of personal taste: I like maximize, and decided to invest in Spell Penetration rather than Spell Focus.<br/>\nMin/Maxing, one could squeeze STR and CON to 8, INT to starting 18, gain either a feat or INT 20 at the end.<br/>\nI also accepted a 5% chance of Superior Dispel in order to have the +3 AC from maxed Tumble (and still get SD not too late, and AA 15). Some may deem wiser to reach Wiz 24; or even Wiz 26, SD 1, AA 13. I started from this spread, thought about it, realised that it is probably a matter of personal preference rather than optimization. Maybe I'm wrong, eh, I'm too unexperienced. What do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Builds of the past:</span><br/>\nyrtsns's Fading Archer: Wizard 15 / Arcane Archer 15 / SD 10 <br/>\nIt's the only build with the same classes, but Epic Dodge has a very high price on spellcasting, and it's not really what I am looking for. Looks very good nevertheless.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a first build; I am looking forward to the criticism and advice of the elders!<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Edit: typos, name of the build</em><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

He should also take Extend &amp; Empower spell, before Dodge &amp; Mobility since he takes SD at level twenty-two. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd kudos for the originality of the build traballa, an Epic spell-caster Archer is something new indeed and I can see the merits of it. Still attaining 46 AB while having twenty-three 1/2 BAB levels in your build and fortifying it with just enough SD levels to get HiPS &amp; UD (protecting your dexterity AC) is a sound approach.

I'm going to include that change when I update the build. I should totally drop something for <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">blight </span>blind fight, maybe called shot. Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n@Stagmeister, thanks for the observations! I didn't take concentration because, and that's true as you've said it, I'm going to be mostly in non-melee situations. However, answering your doubt on HIPS' purpose, I see it as a relatively cheap (2 talents, 1 class, 86 skillpoints) and very effective escape for when you are poorly positioned, or when the enemies react in a way you cannot handle. It happens a lot to me, since I'm not an advanced player yet, and becoming invisible safely and whenever you want - without casting, I mean, or even waiting for your turn - is worth the investment IMO, on gameworlds where True Sight is not so True, as WoG.<br/>\n<br/>\nPicture the typical situation: you appear while casting whatever (time stop, maybe?), you do your nuke damage; enemies cast things, or knockdown people come at you - you press F1, everybody stops, you wait for the end of the round and cast again; even shoot few arrows in the meantime. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also the reason for ESF: Hide, because the +10 half-way counters the +20 Spot people gain on WoG for True Sight. Epic Warding finished? F1. Summoned creature dies? F1. Team-playing, and the boss attacks you instead of the tank? Hell yes, F1. Get dispelled, maybe by a Mordenkainen's? Right. <br/>\nThen again, I think that an experienced player wouldn't find himself in these situations. When I've told Maximilian Kane that I was getting killed by arrows, and that I needed an archer belt, he told me that I wasn't using corners properly - I'll get there, eventually: but in the meantime, there's HIPS!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we can say I chose it as a transitional means of survival :D<br/>\n<br/>\nWow, I wrote too much. Eh, that'll be me as well - I'm a lawyer IRL <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">(not my fault, don't judge!)</span> and I do talk too much.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

While we're at it, feel free to call me Stag) - using HiPS as a defensive rather than offensive tool. Good thinking! I'm still wondering a bit over ESkF: Hide. Surely HiPS would cover that? If you want an epic skills focus, wouldn't Move Silently be a better option? HiPS takes you out of sight, but you can still make noises.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I notice you've got Max Spell, but not Empower. Just the number of feats available stopped you, or was it a more deliberate choice?

You have the OPTION to play with people at pre-scheduled times, but it isn't mandatory at all. I play from Brazil, so I'm on a different time zone as many people who play there, so I mostly solo on WoG.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Now, on to the build. <br/>\n<br/>\nTraballa, for a first build, this is surprisingly good. So, Kudos for that. My first build was WAY worse than yours. I can see that you read my guide. I started looking at the build, and the first thing I noticed was the well-optimized spread. Good job on that. I wouldn't change a thing there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen I started looking at the feat selection, the order you chose to take these feats, and that's when the inexperience starts to show up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like Point Blank shot at 1, for an archer that's a given.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter that, though, I think your priorities are really questionable. You don't take Extend Spell, but take Spell Penetration and Greater Spell Penetration. WHY? Are you facing any spell resistant monsters at level nine? I don't think you should bother with penetration on a build that only has 23 Caster Levels. You waste 3 feats to get your CLs up to 29, still not able to beat Maximum Toolset SR of 32. IMO, those 3 feats are droppable for Blind Fight, Called Shot and, if you drop your starting DEX by 1, you can get 14 STR and still end up at 30 final by using the epic feat for a Great Dexterity.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also drop starting INT a bit, since your HP will be really low, as well as your AC, which is always a dangerous combination. Then you can drop ESF for a Great INT feat to get it back up to 19.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't like Maximize over Empower for Wizards, and I believe that is not really a matter of opinion, but rather a matter of you knowing how to manage your spellbook. If you consider that you want to MAX any particular spell, you can look at the list of spells in the level you'd need to memorize it and you'll see there will ALWAYS be a better spell to spend those slots on. Therefore, I'd go with Empower. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, you have to think this: you're delaying your \"casterness\" for your AB to grow, so you'll NEED the Extended buffs to last through the day, moreso on WoG.<br/>\n<br/>\nCalled Shot is your ONLY non-magic disable, and it's the best one for archers. You can slow enemies down and prevent them from ever reaching you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only think that concerns me is that by choosing these class combo, you're foregoing UMD, which would be a great addition to help you level. I think this gal or lad will need to be alongside someone else to get through the mid levels until her casting catches up to her ranged combat prowess.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, despite all these problems, it's GREAT for a first build, and with these tweaks, it'll be powerful indeed!<br/>\n<br/>\nKudos!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I agree on most parts with Max - the Apostle of WoG - Kane, except the part about spell penetration feats. My logic here is that it is better to have 29 +1d20 penetration rather than 23 +1d20. Empower Vs Maximize, it is a matter of taste, both are good. And no, don't drop Called Shot, rather have both that &amp; Blind-Fight. If you need to drop one other feat to make way for those, then ESF: Hide can go, my logic again is that you have full ranks on a dexterity-based build that you will also enhance it magically at some point so you should have enough to make you invisible to most of your enemies. Hm, I see that even if you drop this, alone it won't be enough to take both feats, then you should drop one of the spell penetration feats alongside esf: hide to make room for both. Keep the rest of them if you can, there will be times that you will need them &amp; Mord's alone won't be enough.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Well, lets look at this more deeply then: <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat spells would you Empower / Maximize with this build?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm going to say only ILMS, IGMS and MAYBE stat buffs until you get gear to make it not needed. Mind you, this is having WoG in mind, since in other realms there may be use for each feat.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, you empower ILMS at level 6, which is the same level as IGMS, so you are better off not empowering it. You Maximize it at level 7, which is the same level where you can get Extended Bigby 6 (to desl with mages) and Bigby 7 (great vs Mages and Clerics, both of whom can dispel you and are therefore a concern), so I would never memorize Maxed ILMS at level 7 with this build. You can Empower IGMS at level 8, and out of all the Bigby hands, the level 8 one is the crappiest. I even prefer Bigby 5 comparing to it. Saving throw that MIGHT stun someone every round and a bit of damage is, IMO, much worse than Empowered IGMS. And you can Max IGMS at level 9, which, I'm sure you'll agree, there are better spells to memorize: Time Stop, Mord's, Summon 9, Bigby 9. All of which are far superior to the aforementioned Maxed IGMS (especially considering you can have it empowered at level 8 in exchange for a much crappier spell choice)<br/>\n<br/>\nEmpowering Stats happens at level 4, which is pretty bad, since that's where you memorize Extended Haste, but IMO, that's a temporary nuisance rather than a dealbreaker. In low magic worlds where you can't cap one stat with items, it may be useful to get Maximize (but not over Empower) for that purpose. But again, he's building for WoG, which allows you to get enough stat-enhancing gear to get around this.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally the Penetration feats. Let's just consider who we'll be fighting: you can't beat Drow or high-level Monk SR with 29 CLs, and everything else is mordable down to 22 (Max toolset SR is 32, -10 from Mord's), so why bother wasting 3 feats on something that won't be decisive? I'd just craft loads of Mord's scrolls for this guy to have enough for whenever needed. Of course, I do know the server very well, as you do, so that's an advantage we have over Traballa.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

From your posts, given your expertise on WoG, I'd say I don't need it: I can then drop it easily for STR 14 and take a Great Dex later on.<br/>\nSame thing applies to Spell Penetration: I've added it because I'd rather not have issues with basic SR guys; but I don't know how high typical SR on WoG is. In my mind, I thought about the d20+caster level+spell penetration, and thought that with a +29 I'd just need to roll a 3 to penetrate SR 32 people (pun not intended, noticed afterwards, left where it is purposefully). That's 10% failure, which - as the 5% superior dispel - is acceptable to me.<br/>\n<strong>Bottom line</strong> for the feats: do I want to have a problem with <strong>SR</strong> enemies, or rather with both <strong>concealed </strong>and <strong>charging-you-with-greataxes</strong> enemies (I mean: called shot)? Dropping Spell Penetration solves issues with meleers (called shot) and concealed bastards (blind fight). Therefore, I think it depends on who's the worst enemy for me. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">And that's something I don't know</span>, but dropping Penetration does free up an epic feat. I'll consider my choices when I'll re-build.<br/>\n<br/>\nEmpower/Maximize: Stag saw that, and Max elaborated really thoroughly. I think I'll test it a bit, and see which spellbook looks the best - I'll keep you elders updated. Not enough caster experience to have a proper opinion at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuild progression: eheheh Max, I knew you'd have pointed where it hurts! Turns out I really didn't think pragmatically about leveling this build, of course Extend goes up. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'll update the Sniping Sneaky Magical Bastard later today, and it will become a Community-Sourced Spellbow. <br/>\n<br/>\nThanks to all! It's going to become powerful and, importantly, fun to play.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

With my Wizards, I memorize Time Stops for all my level 9 slots, and do Empowered IGMSs at 8th by default. I craft scrolls of Mord's and Bigby 9 so I can have more slots for Time Stops. IGMS, maxed or not, doesn't compare to Time Stop. In my playstyle and my builds it doesn't.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a sorcerer, it's a completely different monster. Cuz you can choose on the fly, so I like Maximize Spell A LOT MORE for them then I do for Wizards, with whom you canpre-memorize one or the other. <br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, there's been another nerf to IGMS on WoG, whereas now no more than 15 missiles can hit a single target. About SR mobs, here's what I like to do. I like to either beat Toolset SR and not have to worry about it, or just have another way of killing them, which this guy has. On WoG, a +5 Bow with Might and FW on Arrows will be an efficient way of killing SR mobs, and even some bosses. However, there's one in particular she'll struggle to kill, but not much that she can do there regardless.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon't get me wrong, it's a GREAT SPELL, but I wouldn't waste a level 9 slot on it, having TS at my disposal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

What you say about SR 32 is applicable mostly on modules but there you can kill anything with just your arrows, no need for spell-tactics in order to gain the advantage like you need on most challenging\u00a0 PW's out there. Still, it is much preferable to have 29 +1d20 Penetration rather than 23 +1d20 when you try to battle those encounters. Mobs won't be a problem normally but if a boss encounter has 50 SR then after you \"Mord\" it, you will need 11+ if you have the feats or 17+ if you don't. Just dropping the ESF will give him a feat that he can use for blind-fight or called-shot. Dropping one of the penetration line of feats will give him both, there is no need to drop them entirely though unless you have a really good proposal for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nArguing about your preferences and how you play or build is not very productive, making actual proposals and offering solutions is though and that is what I am encouraging you to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace bro<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Why not be a deadly trap-master in your leisure time?<br/>\n<br/>\nb) Personally, I would split the newly acquired points into both strength &amp; constitution. I know that the main assumption here is that you don't plan to get hit in the first place but in PW's that worth their salt, the epic feats such as greater ruin are empowered and do way more damage. Same thing is true for WoG as well (and drow clerics love to throw them around), so why not having 40 hit points more as a buffer, better be safe than sorry as they say. You can max-out your \"mighty\" bonus with bows quite easily anyway with a few buffs &amp; a single item.<br/>\n<br/>\nc) You could move some feats around for earlier access, maybe try extent/empower spell back-to-back then called-shot, then dodge/mobility just before you get your SD level. <br/>\n<br/>\nMinor nitpicks really, build is good already, we just fine-tuning it now.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

On the really hard bosses I find myself mostly TimeStop/fill their bodies with arrows rather than Mord/IGMS them since many of them got much higher SR than 32.<br/>\nReally well thought out build though!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Or using a level 1 AoE spell such as Grease to trick the faulty AI to waste a Mordenkainen's Disjunction to dispel it, or even pulling an enemy away from a pack of the same faction that simply watches it die and does nothing? I mean, I honestly don't think it's worse than any of these other tactics, which are considered to be good NWN plays. Time Stop + anything works, but at the same time it's extremely expensive and can be done once a day at the most, and if you're a Wizard you have to prepare for it in advance and save the spells for the encounter you plan to use them on, but then you still have all the other encounters to overcome, unless you cheese those too, and invisibly bypass all but the unavoidable encounters. Point is, there will always be a way to exploit the AI in this old game, but I don't really think Time Stop is significantly cheesier than any of the other stuff. Although, bypassing most encounters and then using that combo is something I'd consider extremely cheesy.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

PCs need to survive multiple encounters throughout the day. NPCs just need to give it their all in that one encounter. This radically changes how we look at each of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n2- Have you ever considered how these cheesy things you consider acceptable interact with TS + anything, which you consider unacceptable? I'm sorry to say that I believe you're suffering from a bit of tunnel vision on this one. Imagine, for example if the WDK or Orcus got aggroed and attacked you as soon as you attacked the first minion in their line of sight? Would this \"I win\" combo work? No. So, ironically, the only reason this combo is so good is because the faulty AI doesn't attack you when you target their buddies, otherwise it would be all but useless. If you can't pull enemies away from the pack, then you can't leave the big bad boss for last, alone in a room, which is a requirement for this so-called \"I win\" combo to work. Alternatively, if you somehow managed to use the combo and kill the big bad boss amidst their followers, you'd still be surrounded by baddies by the time the boss somehow died.\u00a0So, by simply correcting something else that's cheesy in the AI, you could potentially nerf this combo by A LOT. I'm sure you'd agree with that if you could somehow let go of your bias against it.<br/>\n<br/>\n3- About Damage Shields, I don't think going around and distributing resistances to everyone would be the way to keep this strategy in check. And if the AI were \"fixed\" to avoid meleeing you when you have those on, then IMO it would also be a terrible thing, since these damage shields would be rendered useless. Again, we're talking about an old game. I always like to look at balance from both angles. The same way a high AB character can kill a monster by repeatedly hitting it, a low AB character should have alternatives to solve the same encounter, otherwise the server would be favoring high AB characters. So, in that sense, damage shields + critical hit immunity do provide a nice alternative. Traps as well. It's not that they should work in all encounters, but if we restrict different strategies in most places, we'll soon be stuck in a server where DEX characters aren't viable because they won't be able to do damage, since everything resists Elemental and Physical damage. Casters aren't viable because everyone resists their stuff, Rogues aren't viable because everyone survives traps with loads of elemental resistance, etc... There will be endless copies of a few builds running around because nothing else works.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, by all means, fix the AI to prevent exploits, but leave Time Stop as a viable alternative to specific situations. I think that'd be much more balancing than just nerfing the combo directly. That's just my 2 cents.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now I'm out.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
