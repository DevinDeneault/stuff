I'm an experienced player on both Arelith and NWN, however I'm failing to come up with a suitable build. I've not developed any sort of concept, but I rather have a basic idea of what I want to play. I prefer to play characters with high AC. I've tested several builds, but I've not been able to satisfy myself. So, I turn to you guys for help!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm looking for 60 Armor Class. I want to be hard to hit. I realize sacrifices will have to be made, and I don't entirely mind. I've rolled up a Bard/Paladin/Fighter and could easily achieve this with the use of proper gear, but I'm not entirely sure I want to play the Bard class. I also tested a Paladin/Rogue/CoT, and with Expertise and Divine Shield I could provide myself a near 60 AC. <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, I'm looking for a high AC melee character. The only thing I want to completely exclude is any Monk/Druid combinations, or anything heavily caster reliant (Use Magic Device excluded from the exclusion, if that even counts as caster reliant.) I want to avoid Bard, even though it has some very strong capabilities and possibilities. Though if it comes down to it, I'll play it. I simply didn't want to play a class that I've already played extensively on Arelith.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Am I right so far?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you want to achieve 60 AC innately without buffs or songs.  Am I getting close?<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you planning on just tanking like a wall or plan on hitting often?<br/>\n<br/>\nAny idea what ACs you are planning on competing against with your bullet-proof idea? (Assuming this is PvP you are requesting.)<br/>\n<br/>\nYou should keep in mind that going the AC route almost always costs either AB, damage or both.  Like cutting the innate down to a mere 50 AC level with ImpExpertise costing huge attack potential.  So if you have consigned yourself to that fact, then DEX is most likely the path to follow since monk AC is also crossed off your list.  No EMA or PM levels because those are associated with caster builds.  Not really sure what you mean by \"anything heavily caster reliant\".  You mean a high-level caster or dependent on caster buffs? Trying to disqualify as many sources from your prereqs to decide what (if anything) is left.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what was wrong with the Paladin/Rogue/CoT you built?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Any 30-level AA, WM or battle cleric on Arelith will hit that without all that much trouble, spamming called leg shots against a DEX build and taunting to make it even that much easier to continue hitting thereafter.  Singers will do very well vs. 60 AC, too (as you are probably well-aware).<br/>\n<br/>\nTrying to comply with your non-caster, non-bard, non monk/druid qualification... well... a PM build ~might~ work but with only 30 levels and without being able to dump early on... I doubt the AB and damage will be good enough.  Suppose I could trying to \"Arelith-ize\" one for you but I am skeptical... and it MUST include your discouraged class, bard.  Sorc/PM would just gimp it further. So, at least consider this out first, if for no other reason than as a comparison metric.  You may end up facing one!<br/>\n<br/>\nDon't know how comfortable you are playing a shifter.  This build is a pretty easy one to learn... focused on only a single power shape and one back-up (epic minotaur).  What I really like is that any weapon that you can equip (in this case, all simple, rogue &amp; exotic) one-handed or two-handed, have the identical effect during merge.  So if you find a +5 dagger of speed, for example, the minotaur weapon will become a +5 battleaxe and all forms using weapons will be hasted.  Just stay alert to the constraints of AC merge becoming all non-stackable deflection, ability-boosting or save-boosting gear will not stack nor will any props on gloves/bracers.  If you have played shifter a lot, I'm sure all this is old news.<br/>\n<br/>\nDusted off an old Risen Lord build, tweaked it for Arelith.  Should at least chew up all the Dragon shape builds.  Just beware of high-level (over 25 class levels) pallies, clerics and BGs.

You are already so close! Druid 6 Rogue 13 Shifter 11 would work wonders!\n</div></blockquote>\nWhy?  The #1 reason I had Rogue 11 hanging out there with over 25 DEX registered already... on full display... was to get a reaction from YOU!   <br/>\n<br/>\nActually, I did have it set that way originally, but IMO it costs too much in light of the OP's goal: AC as near 60 as possible with an effective AB. As it stands now, those numbers are borderline so didn't want to gimp them any further than they are.  Even though the shape itself can't be dispelled, the few low-level druid buffs can. <br/>\n<br/>\nBAB goes to 14 pre-epic.  AC &amp; reflex down by 1. Then the odd-ball DEX 27 hanging out there just annoys me from a personal level, I suppose. I was depending on Stoneskin to help level the unarmed shapes like bear who starts at level 8 then wyrmling the next few levels early on by piercing through enemy DR.  Even the minotaur won't pierce DR like stoned claws. In a shifter build, without optimizing the shapes the best you can with what is at your disposal, your toon can become ineffectual and struggle needlessly.  The bear pal I use gets a significant boost at Dru 8 so can help out MUCH better.  Basically, early on, druids and shifters are somewhat fragile due to the ability deprivation typical with over-ridden stats.  Once RL is available, buffs become slightly less essential, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like the benefit of being able to reduce AB &amp; damage of an enemy in a single attack with Crippling Strike which I will lose going that route.  ED's best value is realized in tight mobs that can hit you easily.  If it triggers on an AoO that misses, it is wasted.  Depends a lot on your play style whether you expose yourself to situations that can take full advantage of it.  There are always trade-offs, Max. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now that you forced me to review my objectives... I just realized that those AB values should be increased by 2 more for nature sense which doesn't count toward the AB cap.  My trainer is only set up for combat evaluation indoors.  In wilderness areas, it would be that much better! <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I realized after posting, that you get 2 free Darkness casts shifting to Drider which is probably faster than reading a scroll with UMD.  Maybe a tie. *lol*<br/>\n<br/>\nI originally had Empower spell where Expertise is now so that I could buff up damage and AB a bit higher with Emp Bull, but the OP seems to be steering away from a self-buffer. Ergo... I decided not to enhance the spellcasting investment any further than it is right now and let him make swaps as he felt comfortable.  TBH, with all my RLs I never once got into a situation where the AB was less important than the AC to use Expertise (and that Crippling Strike effectively increases my AC and it stacks like crazy... much better than taunting).  It's a whole different situation when you take crits and sneaks out of the mix.  Nothing really hurts that severely and you can play reckless if that is your thing.  With enough STR to boost Discipline, KD is no longer an issue.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo to rehash briefly for the OP...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you prefer ED to the features of the build as it is posted, all you need do is swap in 2 rogue levels at clvl 18 &amp; 20 (bye bye stoneskin, 1BAB and nastier bear pal), move EWF to clvl 27 (bye bye Grt DEX), and take Defensive Roll there, followed by Imp Evasion &amp; Epic Dodge on the last level (bye bye Crippling strike).  That should give you another option to consider anyway.  So you'll end up with an extra ability point in WIS that will never get used. Meh, no biggie.  There'll be a few more skill points to twiddle with, as well.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
