We have around 200 more complete builds within these haunts to add to the library.\u00a0 If you have any problems finding builds at all, let us know.<br/>\n<br/>\n One build I noticed that may suit your interest is <em>Strav's</em> <strong>Arcane Blade of Torm</strong> (Fighter 6/Wizard 26/CoT 8).\u00a0 It is set up for a 2-blade sword but can easily be adjusted for just about any sort of light weapons like your shorties.\u00a0 You'll even free up at least one feat by virtue of not needing exotic proficiency.\u00a0 Check it out to decide if it contains the aspects you desire.<br/>\n<br/>\n Spellswords are essentially a compromise between an all-out melee build and a high-level spellcaster so no, they tend not to be so good for PvP since both ends of the spectrum (WM and high-level mage) will dominate your toon rather easily and your spell penetration will suffer some.\u00a0 This mix is used more for thematic reasons and is well-balanced rather than overpowering.\u00a0 But the idea is to have fun with your own ideas so I say persue what you like and have a ball, eh?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
