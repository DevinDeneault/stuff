I was thinking of a dexterity damage dealer that avoids taking damage, rather than tanking it. Attribute-wise I was thinking 15 strength, 16 dexterity, 14 constitution, 14 intelligence, 8 wisdom, 8 charisma. I was planning on primarily using Weapon Master (hence the attributes) with fighter and rouge levels thrown in. For weapons I was planning dual rapiers (I\u2019m aware of penalties) with weapon finesse. Combat is the main focus, general utility doesn\u2019t matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for the record, I intend on going max level and playing the main story for now.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">So, you basically need Mirnaia's build, which is a human variant of Max's Drow Fencer. This doesn't have dual-wielding capabilities though but we can fix that too. Go with human &amp; instead of taking KD/ IKD spend those three feats (one is bonus from being human) to take \"ambidexterity, two-weapon fighting &amp; Improved two-weapon fighting\". Your AB will take a serious hit worth of five points, going from an \"AB of 47 to 42\" with all penalties from dual-wielding medium weapons &amp; changing the race to human, but it won't matter in the long run because it was excessive anyway &amp; the monsters in most modules (especially in OC) are relatively easy to hit. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a link to the original build,<br/>\nDrow Fencer =&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/drow-fencer-fighter-14-rogue-19-weapon-master-7-t2329192.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">drow-fencer-fighter-14-rogue-19-weapon- ... 29192.html</a><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Here is a build I made in 2015 and tweaked now because I am always learning and getting better at building. It is close to what you requested, but uses rapier-and-shield. Dual-wielding would not only cost you shield AC and attack penalties, but also Knockdown / IKD and Improved Critical, too costly.
