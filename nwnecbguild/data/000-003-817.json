      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I think the question here is what kind of build will shine in a high magic environment. <br/>\nSelf-buffers will not feel any good when everyone can get better than their buffs from items floating around. Mages will struggle when all opponents have items with immunity and resistance to everything they can throw at them. CoT will not benefit from their saves bonus. It counts towards the cap and you get items that let you cap the saves anyway. True seeing will nerf stealth and invisibility.\u00a0 Immunities will absorb the damage from traps. <br/>\n+20 AC from dodge, deflection, natural, armor and shield is hard to beat even with a high AB, a capped +20 AB bonus and +6 from a capped attack stat.<br/>\nA typical scenario in such environments is the \"Battle of 20s\" where you never beat the high AC, and only are able to land a hit on a natural 20 roll.<br/>\nIn these extreme cases AB doesn't play much of a role anymore. The number of attacks per round, on the other side, determines how many chances you get at rolling that 20.<br/>\nIn borderline cases, having a high innate AC can help you exceed what your enemy is able to hit, and\u00a0 force him into rolling for 20s to be able to hit you. Expertise can help with that. In those borderline cases it still helps to have a high innate AB as long as it makes you within reach of hitting the enemy.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will try to explain why many people prefer dexterity builds for this kind of high magic scenario.<br/>\nIn a battle of 20s between a strength build and a dexterity build, both will roll a 20 on 5% of their attempts. The strength build will do some more damage on a hit from the strength bonus. But the bigger the weapon enhancements, the smaller is the relative difference. Sometimes the weapon enhancements are so huge that the players question if taking two feats (WS and EWS) is worth it for only a +6 to damage.<br/>\nIn the battle of 20s Dev crit is useless.\u00a0 When you hit on your 20 roll you threat a critical hit, but to confirm it you have to roll again and this time there is no auto-hit on 20. So you will never be able to confirm the critical hit.<br/>\nDexterity builds have higher AC in general. That matters at least in cases bordering on a battle of 20s. <br/>\nED will avoid the first hit in each round. That is far better than only cancelling out an attack per round, since you only roll a 20 in 5% of the cases.<br/>\n50% concealment helps you avoid being hit 50% of the times, or at least 25% if your enemy has Blind fight. Add that to ED and see how often you actually get hit. All builds can get 50% concealment temporarily if they have access to the Displacement or the Improved invisibility spells. If you get it via UMD on scrolls or from item properties, they are usually easily dispellable. The assassins get the Improved invisibility spell as a class feat and monks get the Empty body feat that gives 50% concealment twice per day. <br/>\nDexterity builds have access to the Self concealment feats. 5 feats give you 50% concealment that is undispellable. You need dex 30 before you can start taking it, so it is indeed for dedicated dexterity builds.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal opinion is that high magic is one dimensional and ends up being boring. It can feel exciting when you find items with \u00fcber properties. But if it makes you too powerful, there is little challenge anymore. And when when both you and your enemies have items that protect against everything and AC becomes too high to overcome, there is little left of the game and its challenges.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
