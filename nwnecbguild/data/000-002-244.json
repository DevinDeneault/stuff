However, there are a few things I'm uncertain on. Is Lasting Inspiration really that useful for something you've got so many casts of per day, especially in a build like this? Also, will I be able to get my Perform high enough with items and such on WoG for a level 29-30 Bard Song? Any build recommendations are totally welcome, as always, thanks folks.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hmm, from where to start...<br/>\n<br/>\nOkay the easy things first. In general playing at (low/medium) magic worlds you will want to go STR-based unless there is a particular reason for it to do otherwise. GDL was notorius in his use of STR-based assassins or SD's even and the build you were looking at, is also STR-based as well. Now if you plan to play him as an archer you obviously go DEX-based (or in a high magic world) but apart from that there is really no reason to go for dexterity as main stat, especially with the great AC of an epic bard. Again, those are general guidelines but i believe you get my point.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow let me talk to you for bards. Originally i was against playing bards till i tried <strong>Kail's Black Wind</strong> -&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build293865.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 93865.html</a>  and i loved it.<br/>\nAfter that nothing again was the same, i deviced my own bard to play -&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/moghedien-melody-of-the-dark-bard-26-bg-4-rdd-10-t2350150.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">moghedien-melody-of-the-dark-bard-26-bg-4-rdd-10-t2350150.html</a>  and went drunk in power.<br/>\nThen played a pure bard even (i will post one at yardstick's build section later) and my whole party loved me so much that... i played another one! Mind you this is four times bard at forty and i still didn't want to change.<br/>\nReally what there is to say for The-Best-Buffer-Hands-Down-In-Game?<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, apart from the whole 6th lvl of bard spells, you have your epic song and after that UMD to use all the other spells you might want, save a few (magic vestment for example-damn clerics). You will love it, your party will love you more than that!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for the perform thing. Normally you won't be able to reach the 100 perform that is required for the full lvl 30 bard song. Unless you know item specifics and i won't get into that here, but getting the 80 perform for the lvl 26 bard song it sure not only possible but easy as well. And the lvl 26 bard song is super strong anyway. You won't need anything more than that really. Going to 80 perform is a simple matter of 43 (ranks) + 9 (buffed CHA) + 10 (ESF: perform) + 30 (Epic gloves of minstrel). Heh, that's 92 right there, so you can do it even without buffed CHA anyway. So yeah, it is very much possible to fully utilize a lvl 28 bard song or so and your Curse Song will be even higher than that. Don't be afraid to go bard heavy in WoG at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd for the last part, if <strong> Lasting Inspiration</strong> is worth it, i would definitely say, YES! Having all those buffs pretty much constantly on you and your party is well worth it. And don't forget Curse song de-buff too. You see, the difference is huge man, the normal song lasts 10 rounds and the lasting one 100 rounds, that's ten times more and ensures that all those buffs are all the time ON. It's like you have permanent magic items on you that give you all these buffs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will close with some additional DEX-based builds this time, just in case you want to see one. Now full tumble ranks + bard song + dex build + epic dodge + uncanny dodge,  pretty much means that you will only get hit from spells.<br/>\nHere is a Bard/Ftr/RoGue -&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build270617.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 70617.html</a><br/>\nAnd here is a very nice combo that uses DM to get damage in a DEX-build -&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build298223.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 98223.html</a><br/>\nAnd there are many more from here too, but we don't have a search engine so it's kind of difficult right now to link one. Max has his skeletal musician (no LI though) and another bard too, but i think i already gave you much food for thought already.</div>"

      "content": "<div>I do not know if this is good enough to post it on the 40's section, but it is the closest to what you asked in case the other options i linked did not stir your imagination.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe meaning of this build is all about options, she can wear her full plate and tower shield for maximum defense (but she already has very good AC without those) OR she can dual-wield perfectly her twin shortblades in a quicker-than-the-eye motion to dispatch her foes more quickly. She can set all deadly traps, she can buff herself and a whole team practically forever (240 min is about 3 whole days duration in NwN), she can curse to turn tough foes into jellies, she can identify everything she meets, she has full Bard spells on top of that, she can use any item in the game and so on...I think you don't need me to illustrate, how she can reach a 47 AC &amp; 61 AB with nothing but mundane items. Yeah, epic Bards are that powerful, and more actually.<br/>\n<br/>\n* Her initial build had 2 more STR (32) but i decided against that since this one offers more power earlier. If you want i can show how you can achieve her original power.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, i hope you like her   <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/xq90/198/3aex.jpg\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>THE WILD HUNTER</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>(Bard 24/ Fighter 6/ Ranger 10)</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n RACE: Human<br/>\n<br/>\n ALIGNMENT: Chaotic Neutral<br/>\n<br/>\n PLAYABILITY: PvM 1 \u2013 40<br/>\n<br/>\n STARTING/ ENDING STATS:<br/>\n<br/>\n STR  \u2013  16 (30)<br/>\n DEX \u2013  10<br/>\n CON \u2013  14<br/>\n INT   \u2013  14<br/>\n WIS  \u2013  08<br/>\n CHA \u2013  14 (16)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Hit Points: 424 \u2192 460 {Bard Song}<br/>\n<br/>\n Skill Points: 289 \u2192 {*} lvl 24 Bard Song<br/>\n<br/>\n Concentration: 26 (28) \u2192 {41}<br/>\n Disipline: 43 (53) \u2192 {66}<br/>\n Lore: 4 (30) \u2192 {43}<br/>\n Perform: 43 (56) \u2192 {69}<br/>\n Tumble: 40 (40)<br/>\n Taunt: 43 (46) \u2192 {59}<br/>\n Set Traps: 15 (15) \u2192 {28}<br/>\n Spellcraft: 43 (45) \u2192 {58}<br/>\n UMD: 32 (35) \u2192 {48}<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fort/Ref/Will): 22/ 20/ 19 \u2192 24/ 22/ 22 (Bard Song) \u2192 35/ 33/ 33 (Vs spells)<br/>\n<br/>\n Naked/ Armoured AC: 20/ 32/ 37 (Full plate &amp; tower shield / Bard song and cat's grace)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n BAB: 27 (Four attacks OR Six attacks dual-wield)<br/>\n<br/>\n AB: +41/ +36/ +31/ +26  &amp; +41/ +36 (Dual Shortblades &amp; Bard Song) &amp; Taunt for 6 more<br/>\n<br/>\n DMG: 1d6 +19  &amp; 1d6 +14 / 17-20 x2 (Dual Shortblades &amp; Bard Song) &amp; FE's bonuses<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Spellcasting: Bard 6th lvl of spells &amp; UMD full ranks<br/>\n<br/>\n Epic Bard Song at 24th lvl: +2 AB/ +3 Dmg/ +5 AC/ +13 Skills/ +3 Will/ +2 Fort/ +2 Ref/ +36 Hp's<br/>\n<br/>\n Epic Curse Song Subtracts all these from your foes, duration for both is 100 Rounds each use<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>LEVELING GUIDE</strong>:<br/>\n<br/>\n01) Bard (01): Blind Fight, Knockdown<br/>\n02) Bard (02): <br/>\n03) Ranger (01): WF: Short Sword, TWF, FE I<br/>\n04) Bard (03): <br/>\n05) Bard (04): <br/>\n06) Bard (05): Improved Knockdown<br/>\n07) Bard (06): <br/>\n08) Bard (07): <br/>\n09) Bard (08): Curse Song<br/>\n10) Bard (09): <br/>\n11) Bard (10): <br/>\n12) Bard (11): Still Spell * OR Extend Spell if planning on staying in light armour<br/>\n13) Ranger (02): <br/>\n14) Ranger (03): <br/>\n15) Ranger (04): IC: Short Sword<br/>\n16) Ranger (05): FE II<br/>\n17) Bard (12): <br/>\n18) Ranger (06): Toughness<br/>\n19) Ranger (07): <br/>\n20) Ranger (08): <br/>\n21) Ranger (09): Great STR I, ITWF<br/>\n22) Bard (13): <br/>\n23) Ranger (10): EWF: Short Sword<br/>\n24) Fighter (01): Great STR II, Armour Skin, Heavy Armour Proficiency<br/>\n25) Fighter (02): Epic Prowess<br/>\n26) Fighter (03): <br/>\n27) Bard (14): Great STR III<br/>\n28) Fighter (04): WS: Short Sword<br/>\n29) Fighter (05): <br/>\n30) Fighter (06): Great STR IV, EWS: Short Sword<br/>\n31) Bard (15): <br/>\n32) Bard (16): <br/>\n33) Bard (17): Great STR V<br/>\n34) Bard (18): <br/>\n35) Bard (19): <br/>\n36) Bard (20): Lasting Inspiration<br/>\n37) Bard (21): <br/>\n38) Bard (22): <br/>\n39) Bard (23): Great STR VI, ESF: Perform<br/>\n40) Bard (24): <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>SPECIAL NOTES</strong>: <br/>\n<br/>\n* Undispellable Bard<br/>\n<br/>\n* Epic Bard Song &amp; Curse Song of 24th Lvl<br/>\n<br/>\n* Dual Wielding<br/>\n<br/>\n* Deadly Trapmaster<br/>\n<br/>\n* Epic Specialized in Shortblades</div>"
