It's a variation of something that exists (at least in the old ECB search engine) so I wasn't sure... I'd be happy to post it, of course, but I thought it'd be nice to get some initial feedback on it before a finalized build is posted.<br/>\n<br/>\nAttached is a zip of the Excel sheet. I'm primarily looking for input on optimization of leveling sequence, feat selections (I'd like to keep all meta-magic feats there), and if there's a better class combo with similar/better final stats. Goal of the character is to keep the build regardless of medium-high magic server, and regardless of Dev-crit in place or not (to be clear, I don't want it, but I'd like to make sure I can save alright against it). It's towershield and longsword, long-lasting with tricks up his sleeves (much the same, I think, as described in The Veteran Party-Leader (see link below).<br/>\n<br/>\nBuild based on the following build; the first more than the others:<br/>\n- <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build241216.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Veteran Party-Leader</a> by Xylophone<br/>\n- <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build241764.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Harper Galloglas</a> by grizzled_dwarflord (this is two pages, I just noticed recently, hehe)<br/>\n- <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build245431.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Explicate Lyrics</a> by dmuzzy<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for reading. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-JimDandy--------------------<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"/attach/view/ma/863125_f2d46e189f8a6a8475a116333237e111\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to view the attachment</a><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'm struggling with choosing feats that are only available for the fighter and champion as bonus feats, and from that list I've been interested in Knockdown, Improved Knockdown, Disarm, Improved Disarm, Called Shot, and Expertise. I think I rate Called Shot over any of them, but can't decide for the next. I've not got enough experience with Expertise, but Knockdown and Disarm seem limited-in-real-play to me (plus I don't have enough space take the improved version of either, if I also take Called Shot).<br/>\n<br/>\nOutput from my Called Shot &amp; Expertise version of the attached Excel sheet:<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 15 (28)<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 16<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 14 (16)<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Bard(1): Luck of Heroes, Strong Soul<br/>\n02: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus: Longsword<br/>\n03: Bard(2): Scribe Scroll<br/>\n04: Fighter(2): STR+1, Called Shot, (STR=16)<br/>\n05: Bard(3)<br/>\n06: Fighter(3): Extend Spell<br/>\n07: Bard(4)<br/>\n08: Fighter(4): CHA+1, Weapon Specialization: Longsword, (CHA=15)<br/>\n09: Bard(5): Brew Potion<br/>\n10: Champion of Torm(1)<br/>\n11: Champion of Torm(2): Blind Fight<br/>\n12: Bard(6): STR+1, Silent Spell, (STR=17)<br/>\n13: Champion of Torm(3): {Smite Evil}<br/>\n14: Bard(7)<br/>\n15: Bard(8): Craft Wand<br/>\n16: Champion of Torm(4): STR+1, Expertise, (STR=18)<br/>\n17: Bard(9)<br/>\n18: Bard(10): Curse Song<br/>\n19: Bard(11)<br/>\n20: Bard(12): STR+1, (STR=19)<br/>\n21: Champion of Torm(5): Great Strength I, (STR=20)<br/>\n22: Champion of Torm(6): Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword<br/>\n23: Champion of Torm(7)<br/>\n24: Champion of Torm(8): CHA+1, Epic Prowess, Epic Weapon Specialization: Longsword, (CHA=16)<br/>\n25: Champion of Torm(9)<br/>\n26: Champion of Torm(10): Armor Skin<br/>\n27: Bard(13): Epic Will<br/>\n28: Bard(14): STR+1, (STR=21)<br/>\n29: Bard(15)<br/>\n30: Bard(16): Great Strength II, (STR=22)<br/>\n31: Bard(17)<br/>\n32: Bard(18): STR+1, (STR=23)<br/>\n33: Bard(19): Great Strength III, (STR=24)<br/>\n34: Bard(20)<br/>\n35: Bard(21)<br/>\n36: Bard(22): STR+1, Great Strength IV, (STR=26)<br/>\n37: Bard(23): Lingering Song<br/>\n38: Bard(24)<br/>\n39: Bard(25): Great Strength V, (STR=27)<br/>\n40: Bard(26): STR+1, Epic Skill Focus: Perform, (STR=28)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 416<br/>\nSkillpoints: 273<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 32/30/28<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Death: +1<br/>\nBAB: 27<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 40 (melee), 27 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 11/22<br/>\nSpell Casting: Bard(6)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nPerform 43(56), remaining skillpoints 236<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hey, Jim!<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, Expertise is one of the best if not THE BEST feat for a meleer early on and remains very useful throughout your entire career. It's definitely worth the investment and it works WONDERS in conjunction with Taunt. I'll refer you to my Paladin guide here so that you can see how these two feat interact with one another. This alone, I'm sure, will make you appreciate Expertise much more. Here's the link:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/the-holy-class-a-guide-to-paladins-t515492.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Holy Class - A Guide to Paladins</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIn that guide I have a link to one of my builds (The Holy Weapon Master With Cheese). Just below that is a detailed explanation of the Taunt / Expertise combo, and some of the fortunate finding I had when using these feats together.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn't rate Called Shot over KD. KD makes you not receive any attacks while still dealing damage through your attacks, so in a way, free damage. Called Shot lowers your enemy's AC or AB by a bit every hit, but they can still attack. Called Shot becomes better with Monks because of their custom attack Schedule of 8 APR when Hasted and 10 dual-wielding. The amount by which you can lower the enemy STR is just BRUTAL. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe usefulness of feats also depends on the environment in which you play. If there are a lot of KD-immune critters, then KD automatically becomes less attractive. If there are a lot of high-discipline meleers, then Disarm also becomes less attractive. So on and so forth. When you've played in several places, you will find that the main factor in deciding which feats to go for is the server where you play.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Great info, Max. I had actually read that Paladin guide, but I guess I hadn't grokked (sp?) the part about taunt and expertise, so I definitely appreciate the refresh.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding Called Shot, I find it refreshing over Knockdown (and Disarm is below knockdown), so it's a bit personal preference, it's a bit character concept, and it's a bit server. Sometimes I wish you could get a couple of feats discounts, because some feats are just worth more than others in the NWN world of things. Anyway, Knockdown is one of those feats where I feel I don't get the full benefit unless I also take IKD (which I think should come at a discount, hehe), and in somewhat feat-starved builds, I'll leave it out. Granted, this build has some wiggleroom in the feats department, but with my selection of meta-magic feats and reluctance to take pre-epic feats in epic levels (I wouldn't have much of an issue taking off 2 Great Strengths), it is what it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was initially going to go a lot bard-heavier with the build, like in the 30-35 range, 26 is good enough for a bard, IMHO, so you reach the no-dispel limit. Especially when the spells aren't offensive in the sense that they need a higher DC on them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you, Maximillian, for your input.  I wonder what further variations we could do on a build like this. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-JimDandy<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I wonder what further variations we could do on a build like this. </div></blockquote>\n\nYou're welcome <br/>\n<br/>\nI think you could conceptualize it a little better. This build has strong saves, it takes feats to improve said saves. Bard Song improves the saves. Why not go for a HIGH SAVES build? IMO this is why it doesn't differ from the previous ones, lack of a different context (angle). How can you make it differ? How about focusing on one of the strengths of this class combo? I'm thinking Bard 16 / Fighter 6 CoT 18. One more feat, but becomes dispellable. CRAZY HIGH saves with those extra CoT levels. Bard Song can't be dispelled, so that bonus you won't lose. Take out Lasting Inspiration, include Lingering Song pre-epic, might have to drop either KD or Called Shot. Take out Scribe Scroll and Brew Potion, and add Power Attack and Cleave, remove Strong Soul and take Great Cleave. Change weapon to Scimitar, remove Silent Spell, put in Extend Spell. With these tweaks you can move some epic feats around, get rid of ESF: Taunt, for example, and use CoT bonus feats (instead of Bard ones) to get Devcrit. Now you have yourself a Devcritter who's very resistant to Devcrit himself. Boom, you have a new angle and a build that differs significantly enough from the ones you mentioned to deserve being posted (except someone may already have done that, so you gotta check the search engine again).<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Yes, for the purpose of making it an official build to post here, I think a finer definition would be appropriate. I'll digest what you've shared with me and see what comes out, hehe. It's very true about what setting and server you play on, and I'm also realizing that I'd need to figure out what the impact of level 16 bard vs. level 26 is, in practicality. I've not done much research on it, I just know the basics of more more bard levels resulting in bonus spells (haven't looked at the table for that, tbh), higher DC for - important for the offensive spells -, and better bard song. In this server's case, it will also affect max UMD as it's being enforced by deleveling you if you go above UMD-class +3 (a little broken to not enforce on the rest of the skills, but whatever).<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm actually going to play on WoG soon, so I may indeed change the build to suit that setting better. I know Dev Crit is allowed there, so at the very least I'd want to make sure I am able to withstand it with high saves. I'm not familiar with everything WoG does custom, yet, so I can't really say more more than that, other than that I think skilldumping is allowed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've read up on Called Shot and found that it, reportedly, lasts for 4 rounds per hit, so obviously it helps to spam it with a lot of attacks. I'd be limited to 5 APR (hasted), so using called shot (melee-like) isn't optimal - I still think it's fun, but it might be nice to see a table for return of investment. I've always been a fan of Knockdown, I just get the impression that since it is so good, a lot of environments allow immunities to it, and so that makes it less usable. Problem is, you never know... with more \"warrior\" bonus feats, you'd be more prepared to deal with things as a meleer. I think this build deals with it as a meta-magic'er, hehe.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, I didn't take ESF: Taunt (just ESF: Perform), since I read that bard song essentially boost skills far more than any ESF. I did notice that I had Silent Spell when I meant to choose Still Spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nDev crit build with scimitar, well - we all drool at those, powergamer-wise. I'm conflicted about that much cheese, hehe. Plenty of Bard/RDDs/Whatever builds out there - I think I'd be happy just failing the save on a roll of 1 instead of being able to dish it out, myself. I'll probably think of that a bit! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-JimDandy<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I've got to run for now, but I'm dwelling on a build that would use Dual Sword (sp?) (perhaps with 7-8 RDD levels and 6 CoT levels) that would explore taking the Weapon Proficiency: Exotic and then Weapon Focus: Dual Sword to qualify for CoT, then use RDD to increase stats instead of using epic feats for that. No idea if it's worth it or not, or if fighter levels are better, but I thought I'd look when I get the chance. I have seen Ranger STR builds using a double weapon, there are benefits when using Power Attack, weapon specialization for 1 weapon instead of 2, Disarm with a big weapon, etc. Thoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm still favoring something with at least 20 levels of Bard, for the Lasting Inspiration, but I'm less concerned about 26 levels now.<br/>\n<br/>\nG2G, ttyl <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n-JimDandy<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I really prefer all that saving throw bonus over what the fighter class brings to the table, and since I'm fond of the Neutral Good alignment for this character concept, as well, I've chosen to honor Torm with the following build (Greatsword). I've buffed the Will and Fortitude saves as much as possible using 6 feats and CoT levels. The LoH and SS starting feats also appeal to me for RP purposes of this build, and I just don't want to be dispellable so I'm sticking with 26 levels Bard. I kinda just want Bard to be most of the build, too, anyway, because it's a Bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there anything else I could optimize as far as level, feats, and skill points distribution goes? If worst comes to worst he'll Tower Shield for a while, or simply subterfuge a bit with utilities to get out of harm's way. I'm pretty set in the feat selections, but I guess the feats I'd be the most willing to give up (if I had to) are Improved Disarm, Disarm, and Extend Spell, in that order of priority (not sure if it's useful to have Disarm without Improved Disarm). Not sure if I really need a higher Strength (BAB) since ultimately I need to enjoy playing (and failing some attacks) than being bored and hitting all the time, hehe.

I still haven't run into you on WoG, but no doubt I will soon enough. So, I agree with Empyre's Suggestion to take WS and EWS. WS is the extra feat from Fighter 4, no sweat about it, EWS is the problem:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe answer on which feat to drop is actually not on your feats, but starting stats. I know HP is nice to have, especially on WoG, but not at the cost of AB and damage. But, just for the hell of it, suppose you want to leave those 16 points in CON to have a bunch of HPs, right? Why 10 WISDOM? Just get rid of Wisdom and put those points into your starting STR. BOOM, you can drop another Great Strength feat for Epic Weapon Specialization. Everyone is happy.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Nice to see you're getting acquainted there already. It's just a number, but if the -1 in WIS kills your fun, then you should reduce CON like Empyre suggested to increase STR.<br/>\n<br/>\nCuz meleers need to HIT their targets to inflict damage. You will painfully find out that WoG bosses are very tough and require you to have optimized stats in order to face them. If you don't hit, you don't damage. For comparison, my highest AB build on WoG thus far will have 51 base AB at 40. I could increase it to 52. My lowest AB build has 35 (but it's a Cleric). The Cleric can reach 61 fully-buffed AB. The meleer can reach 65 on its own without True Strike scrolls. You need at least 58 AB to even stand a chance against WoG epic bosses. Is 58 AB good? No, ideally you would need over 60 AB to hit a WoG epic boss consistently enough to actually kill him (before he kills you). And that's not mentioning AC. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know about your experience pre-WoG, but the Single Player campaigns are, as a whole, A LOT EASIER. If you don't optimize your builds, you take the risk of being in an unenviable position of not being able to get past a certain level without aid. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, hopefully I'll see you soon on WoG. Maybe you can play with BC and I in one of our adventures.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Bosses generally have very high saves, so overpowered that it's not even funny. Not to mention skill totals. Try Taunting a sub-boss and you'll see what I mean. Unless you attack their weak save or skill (such as fortitude to a caster), rule of thumb is you won't Devcrit them or Taunt them or implode them or KD them. WoG bosses are bosses, and although there are exceptions, that is a very consistent rule. Sometimes an underboss is tougher than the boss depending on the type of toon you are playing or strategy you are employing. For example: Sonic traps can be GREAT against melee bosses early on, cuz they will probably get stunned (it's their weak save). I can tell you I have done that many a time .<br/>\n<br/>\nHope to run into you sometime. Gonna play probably most of the afternoon.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Also, I'm considering saving more feats for stuff I like and *gasp* ditching Power Attack and Cleave. Now, I'd like to make the guy an elf, too. I'll post my thoughts based on this template in a few hours. :)<br/>\n<br/>\n LoTR group? In WoG? How... how... what? :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If it doesn't clash with real life hours and if I can come up with a LoTR theme I'd like to play, I'll look to join up! Honestly always wanted to try a dex-based elf archer (not really that keen on the arcane archer approach, however), this might be the time for that to come true. Feel free to mention a suggestion for that since I'll probably take a template and go with it instead of sinking a ton of time into fine-tuning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n -JimDandy</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
