      "content": "<div>Nice, looks like we have some activity here again!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is a build that I've been using recently and it has turned out better than expected.  The concept was to make a STR based dual-wielding toon with good AC.  I wanted to use a two-bladed sword because it is (in my opinion) an under-utilized weapon and also because it is not something that you could \"cheat\" and switch to sword and board.  I'm quite happy with the results because these 3 classes offer a nice bundle of synergies.<br/>\n<br/>\nRanger gives the primary offensive capabilities in this build.  In addition to the full BAB schedule, it offers the dual-wield capabilities, favored enemies/bane of enemies for additional damage, hearty meatshields (ranger summons and through animal empathy), some spells and a wide selection of skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk gives the primary defensive capabilities.  With full WIS gear, I can get the AC to make up for a +5 tower shield in this build.  The 6 monk levels also gives a speed bonus, the ability to fight unarmed if I get disarmed and KD/IKD (although only at lvl 37).  Also, it allows easy access to Shadowdancer (Tumble 5 required so no cross-classing needed with Monk).<br/>\n<br/>\nShadowdancer gives the X factor.  It offers HiPS of course, but the second level provides Uncanny Dodge and Darkvision.  Uncanny Dodge is important because the Ghost Viper fights in robes and DEX is needed to maintain his high AC.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>The Ghost Viper:  Ranger 32 / Monk 6 / Shadowdancer

Spot(1), <br/>\n<br/>\nSkill selection is up to personal taste.  One could easily drop Listen or Spot to grab Concentration or some trap skills for example.<br/>\n<br/>\nAB is only 42 due to the Two-Bladed Sword giving a -2 so it isn't very high for a melee toon.  However, it can help make it up against the 8 Favored Enemies (from Bane) and catching folks flat-footed by HiPS.  Having a pet, summons and/or dominated animals through Animal Empathy allows for flanking opportunities.  Also, I picked Disarm and Improved Disarm to take advantage of using a large weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nNaked AC is 10 + 2 (DEX) + 2 (WIS) + 1 (Monk 5) + 2 (Armor Skin) + 8 (Tumble) = 25<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, it can boosted by the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n5 (Armor) + 6 (DEX +12) + 6 (WIS +12) + 5 (Deflection) + 5 (Natural) + 5 (Dodge) + 4 (Haste) = 61<br/>\n<br/>\nDodge gives +1 to AC against 1 opponent<br/>\n(*) If Expertise / Improved Expertise is chosen, then AC can be up to 71 (72 against 1 opponent) which is pretty good for dual-wielding a STR toon.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the downsides of the build:<br/>\n1. As mentioned earlier, the AB (42) isn't great<br/>\n2. KD/IKD isn't obtained until level 37<br/>\n3. No UMD<br/>\n4. Equipment reliant to get the high AC, mainly the DEX and WIS enhancements<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are 4 other Ranger/Monk/SD variations in the search engine.  All use Kamas, except 1 which is unarmed.  I know Kamas would give a better attack schedule but that's been overdone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build197247.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kama Fury ranger 23 / monk 7 / shadowdancer 10 (human) by Kaliban99</a><br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build267622.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shadow of the Woods ranger 23 / monk 12 / shadowdancer 5 (elf) by Ithacan</a><br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build197547.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kama Fury ver. 2 ranger 25 / monk 10 / shadowdancer 5 (human) by Kaliban99</a><br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build124393.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ranger 38 / Monk 1 / SD 1 ranger 38 / monk 1 / shadowdancer 1 (elf) by sobebop</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI think the builds that are closer in relation are here.

      "content": "<div>Here is a short story I wrote for the Ghost Viper.  Enjoy!<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSpoiler<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t[+]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tThe winter snows had come to the forest early this year, but the unicorn didn't mind.  He had always enjoyed digging through the snow to find nubs of foliage to eat; it was a kind of game to him.  Had his elders known they would have frowned upon his perspective, but the unicorn was still young and hadn't experienced much hardship yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter digging around his current spot to no avail, he was about to head on when he felt a sense of unease.  He pause for a split-second, and that pause saved his life, at least temporarily.  A sudden wave of pain erupted on his right side and sent him onto his front knees.  A crossbow bolt had punched through his right shoulder and only a few inches was left sticking out.  Had the unicorn taken a step, the bolt would have pierced his heart and proved instantly fatal, but as it was, it was still a grievous wound and he would succumb to blood loss and shock if it was not immediately attended to.<br/>\n<br/>\nDespite the shock and pain, the unicorn's survival instincts kicked in and he took off through the trees.<br/>\n<br/>\nA curse erupted behind the fleeing unicorn and four previously unseen figures emerged from the snow.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"How did you miss Marko?  That unicorn was in your sights!\" shouted the apparent leader, a hulking human wrapped in furs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"I had him, Jek.  That dumb animal just stopped!\" replied Marko, a dirty looking elf<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Well, let's not just stand here.  Let's finish the job before the Ghost Viper shows up!,\" urged the third, another human but half the size of Marko.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Then set Fang loose, you imbecile!\" ordered Marko, pointing at the shaggy mastiff the third man was struggling to hold onto.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a separte part of the forest, a man was offering his morning prayers.  Despite the obvious cold, he sat comfortably on the ground in a lotus position wearing only breaches.  His eyes were closed, hands with palms facing outward and, other than the large winding snake tattoos on his arms and a wicked looking polearm  at his feet, was a picture of peace and serenity.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile deep in concentration, he sensed a disturbance in the woods heading towards him.  While he was obviously trained to ignore such incidents, his goddess indicated that this was something requiring his attention so he broke off his prayers and got to his feet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe stricken unicorn burst into the clearing, and upon seeing the man, surged towards him with a final burst of speed.  No sooner than had he covered the distance, he fell to the ground, panting and foaming at the mouth.  The man rushed over and whispered a prayer to soothe the dying creature and offer what little healing he could.  Without his morning prayers completed, he didn't have his more potent spells available so he hoped what little he had was enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore disturbance followed and the man picked up his polearm, a staff with a curved and serrated blade at each end, to welcome the visitors.  First into the clearing was Fang.  He spotted the prey and began growling, but did not advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoon after, the three hunters appeared.  The dog handler cursed immediately at the sight of the man.  \"The Ghost Viper...\"<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout waiting for the hunters, the man spoke in a calm and emotion-less voice.  \"I am Tako Shadowstride, the royal warden for these woods.  You are trespassing on the King's land and have attempted to murder one of his noble servants.  Lay down your arms and surrender, or face justice at the hands of nature.  I will not ask again.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe elf and the dog handler began backing up but Marko was having none of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"You don't scare me Tako, or Ghost Viper, or whatever you're called.  I'm going to mount your head next to the unicorn's!  Kill him!\"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe elf drew his crossbow and fired a shot, the dog handler ordered Fang to attack, and along with Marko, drew his weapon and charged.<br/>\n<br/>\nTako sidestepped the bolt with ease and focused on the dog.  Just as the dog was about to leap, Tako merely held out his palm and whispered \"Stop.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nFang instantly stopped, and rolled over onto his back, as dogs do when they submit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe two charging humans cursed in surprised and shouted at the dog to attack, but the dog remained on his back.  When they turned their attention back to Tako, they realized he was no longer there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"What the...\"<br/>\n<br/>\n\"Where did he...\"<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout warning, Tako appeared behind them and with one swing of his blade, decapitated the two.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe elf was busy reloading when he saw what happened to his comrades and decided enough was enough.  He turned to run, but then realized his feet were tangled in the undergrowth and he could not move.  Panic took over and he looked up, fully expecting Tako to be heading toward him, but there was no one there.  He turned around again, this time more forcibly, and managed to free his feet.  A sense of relief and hope that he would escape with his life briefly washed over him, until he saw a pointed blade protrude from his chest.  The elf's last thoughts were of how he appreciated the Ghost Viper nickname.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hail Demos!<br/>\n<br/>\nCool build you've devised there. It's original and all, but there are some things bugging me about it:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- I play on WoG, and I don't think there you can cap Strength (for AB), Dexterity and Wisdom WHILE still having +5 Deflection, +5 Armor, +5 Natural etc... So for this build to actually live up to its full potential, we are talking some SERIOUS High Magic! In such hypothetical worlds, it would be fearsome. In a regular world, you need to choose between capping your stats and getting modifiers for your AC. Can't have it both ways. In a low-magic world, he'd either have low AC or low AB.<br/>\n<br/>\n2- You are a HiPSer, so why 14 CON? Maybe you could lower CON to 12, INT to 12 (since you aren't going for Expertise anyway and Monks get IKD even if they don't meet the requirements). So, lower INT to 12, Drop Spot or Listen (pick one, on WoG drop Listen cuz True Seeing adds to Spot), Con to 12 losing some HP (who cares? You can HiPS your way out of danger) and start with 16 STR for +1 AB and damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n3- With your low AC, I doubt you want to go around generating AoOs for your enemies, which is why I don't understand Improved Disarm being taken SO FAR APART from Disarm. I would take Disarm at 6 and Improved Disarm at 9. If you are going to use it at all, then that's what you should do. Alternatively, you can delay Disarm and its improved version to levels 15 and 18 if you don't plan on using them. If so, anticipate Improved Critical to level 9. IMO Dodge should be taken only at lvl 15 and Mobility at 18. Those feats are only in there because they are requirements for SD.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, TBH I would prefer a dual-kama DEX build with this class combo due to the possibility of having Epic Dodge (You'd need to alter the spread to 26 R / 9 M / 5 SD), but I understand the concept and the weapon does give him a nice unique touch. <br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Cool story btw!<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hi Max!  Thanks for looking at the build and providing some input.  I'll answer your questions and comments one at a time.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>1- I play on WoG, and I don't think there you can cap Strength (for AB), Dexterity and Wisdom WHILE still having +5 Deflection, +5 Armor, +5 Natural etc... So for this build to actually live up to its full potential, we are talking some SERIOUS High Magic! In such hypothetical worlds, it would be fearsome. In a regular world, you need to choose between capping your stats and getting modifiers for your AC. Can't have it both ways. In a low-magic world, he'd either have low AC or low AB.</div></blockquote>\n\nI haven't been on WoG in a while but I did use to call it home. In fact, I've been looking through the toons I have on the WoG server and trying to remember what I was trying to do with each! Back on topic though, I went through some of the typical enhancements, both on WoG, and other places and it looks like it is not unreasonable to get close to the max enhancements.  For example,<br/>\n<br/>\nStrength:  Bull Strength Potion gives 2-5, Strength belts are common enough to give 4 or 5.  That just leaves another piece of equipment for another 2 or 3 points to Strength.<br/>\nDexterity:  Cat's Grace (either potion or spell) gives 2-5, Dex+4 or +5 gloves are common enough, and Boots of the Sun Soul +5 give both Dodge AC +5 and Dex +3<br/>\nWisdom: Owl's Wisdom Potion gives 2-5, Helms of Wisdom give 4 or 5, so you just need another item for the final points.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn ioun stone gives +2 so that can be used to make up some of the difference.  On WoG, I know they have the bracers that give Shield AC so you could theoretically forgo some of the DEX or WIS enhancements because you'll make it up that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeflection (cloak of fortification, ring of protection), Natural (amulet), and Armor (robes) are typically not an issue.  Haste may be harder to come by depending on the environment if you don't have a friendly spell caster around.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did say in the post that one of the Con's of the build is that it is reliant on ways to boost the AC but I think this is still doable.  It may mean that your buffs may need to be temporary (through potions) or that you have to know what drops are available in your world and have to plan ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><div>2- You are a HiPSer, so why 14 CON? Maybe you could lower CON to 12, INT to 12 (since you aren't going for Expertise anyway and Monks get IKD even if they don't meet the requirements). So, lower INT to 12, Drop Spot or Listen (pick one, on WoG drop Listen cuz True Seeing adds to Spot), Con to 12 losing some HP (who cares? You can HiPS your way out of danger) and start with 16 STR for +1 AB and damage.</div></blockquote>\n\nI chose the 14 CON because I knew that my AC would still not be great and HiPS doesn't become an option until 21. HiPS may not always work (you still get detected) and WoG has a cool-down period for using it (other places may as well) so the extra HP is useful.  Regarding the INT drop to 12, my original build actually went Expertise / Improved Expertise so I needed the INT of 14.  I also like having the vast array of skills the classes have access to.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><div>3- With your low AC, I doubt you want to go around generating AoOs for your enemies, which is why I don't understand Improved Disarm being taken SO FAR APART from Disarm. I would take Disarm at 6 and Improved Disarm at 9. If you are going to use it at all, then that's what you should do. Alternatively, you can delay Disarm and its improved version to levels 15 and 18 if you don't plan on using them. If so, anticipate Improved Critical to level 9. IMO Dodge should be taken only at lvl 15 and Mobility at 18. Those feats are only in there because they are requirements for SD.</div></blockquote>\n\nAs mentioned above, the toon that is running around actually has Expertise/Improved Expertise.  I took Expertise at 9 and Improved Expertise at 18 and only considered using Disarm when posting the build.  That's a good catch and Disarm / Improved Disarm should be closer.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT:  Rearranged the feats to get Disarm / Improved Disarm closer in the build.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding Dodge, I actually like that feat because it does give an AC bonus against 1 enemy.  It's not much but is useful in the early levels if you can spare the feat and if I know I need it for the build, I typically take it earlier rather than later.</div>"

      "content": "<div><blockquote><div>I haven't been on WoG in a while but I did use to call it home. In fact, I've been looking through the toons I have on the WoG server and trying to remember what I was trying to do with each! Back on topic though, I went through some of the typical enhancements, both on WoG, and other places and it looks like it is not unreasonable to get close to the max enhancements. For example,<br/>\n<br/>\nStrength: Bull Strength Potion gives 2-5, Strength belts are common enough to give 4 or 5. That just leaves another piece of equipment for another 2 or 3 points to Strength.<br/>\nDexterity: Cat's Grace (either potion or spell) gives 2-5, Dex+4 or +5 gloves are common enough, and Boots of the Sun Soul +5 give both Dodge AC +5 and Dex +3<br/>\nWisdom: Owl's Wisdom Potion gives 2-5, Helms of Wisdom give 4 or 5, so you just need another item for the final points.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn ioun stone gives +2 so that can be used to make up some of the difference. On WoG, I know they have the bracers that give Shield AC so you could theoretically forgo some of the DEX or WIS enhancements because you'll make it up that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeflection (cloak of fortification, ring of protection), Natural (amulet), and Armor (robes) are typically not an issue. Haste may be harder to come by depending on the environment if you don't have a friendly spell caster around.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did say in the post that one of the Con's of the build is that it is reliant on ways to boost the AC but I think this is still doable. It may mean that your buffs may need to be temporary (through potions) or that you have to know what drops are available in your world and have to plan ahead.</div></blockquote>\n\nOK, so you are counting on potions and temporary enhancements to reach the caps in stats, then it's less of an issue, but you won't have enough resources to walk around buffed all the time. You'll need to walk around at 75% of your power and buff for the main battles, and have enough potions to rebuff if dispelled, that will be expensive. A small correction, potions give 2-5 enhancement to stats, not 3-5 (it's 1d4 +1).<br/>\n<br/>\nNonetheless, buying wands from a caster there could work better for you, because the caster level is 15 on them, so they last WAY longer. Unfortunately, you don't have UMD, so that isn't an option for you...<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, on WoG you'll need one item slot for perma-haste (the items that do have it are very rare and only attainable after you reach 35th level via DM buy save just a few exceptions). The bracers of shielding also give +2 to DEX, so those are a must for your build. Here's how you could equip him for the most part of his life:<br/>\n<br/>\nHelm of Wisdom +3 (there is a +4 one, but it's hard to get due to whom you need to kill to get it).<br/>\nCloak of Protection +5<br/>\nRing of Dexterity +5 (after level 25+ you can face the boss who drops it, before there is a +2 one)<br/>\nBracers of Shielding (+4 Shield AC, +2 DEX)<br/>\nBelt of Frost Giant Strength (nearing level 40 you can get a belt of Cloud Giant Strength, which then would make you operational)<br/>\nHabit of the Dragon (and later Robes of the Blackhawk)<br/>\nRing of Wisdom +5 (DM buy lvl 25) or Ring of Strength +5 (more AB, less AC)<br/>\nAmulet of Natural Armor +5<br/>\nBoots of the Sun Soul (the +5 ones are attained way later, but there are +2 and +3 ones available reasonably soon)<br/>\n<br/>\nPale Blue Ioun Stone - +2 to Strength<br/>\n<br/>\nSo there you have +10 to DEX (can be capped with a potion), +8 to WIS (+9 nearing lvl 40 when you get the +4 Helm) which can be capped 75% of the time, +6 to Strength (+10 nearing lvl 40), +5 Deflection, +5 Dodge, +5 Natural, +5 Armor AC and +4 Shield AC and NO PERMA-HASTE or room for it, which means that if there isn't a Two-bladed sword with that property (which there probably isn't), you'll need to unequip one of the items for it. I guess you could drop 1 Deflection AC and stock up on Brooches of Shielding to make room for that perma-haste cloak, so it's theoretically doable.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou'll be short one, maybe two item slots all the time to achieve what you are trying to do. I have my doubts if that's actually achievable at all. Basically, my point is, trying to cap 3 stats without EMA is PAINFUL LOL.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>I chose the 14 CON because I knew that my AC would still not be great and HiPS doesn't become an option until 21. HiPS may not always work (you still get detected) and WoG has a cool-down period for using it (other places may as well) so the extra HP is useful. Regarding the INT drop to 12, my original build actually went Expertise / Improved Expertise so I needed the INT of 14. I also like having the vast array of skills the classes have access to.</div></blockquote>\n\nI prefer this toon with Expertise and Improved Expertise rather than Disarm feats. On WoG they are GOLD. If you have them, I would take Expertise at level 1 and delay Weapon Focus to 3, Blind Fight to 6, etc... Expertise is EXCELLENT early on. Improved Expertise can be taken later on, as it's only useful after you have at least some BAB. I would definitely rate Expertise above Dodge in ANY melee build. You can take Dodge earlier, I can understand that, but not before Expertise. If you look at my builds, most of them have Expertise from level 1 or soon after that.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

Also they've modified Blade Thirst to act like GMW so you could still make it a +5 (been a while but think that's correct).<br/>\n<br/>\nI've been playing in Kharlindale and there you have a custom system that allows you to upgrade armor, shields and weapons with various enhancements (capped at +5 for most) so my toon actually can walk around with full STR, WIS and DEX bonuses.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs we always talk about, these are scenarios that players would adapt to fit their PW.  How players get the max out of the character, if possible, is up to magic available in their world.  Even if you can't max out all the statistics, you can still get an idea what the build is capable of based on your play style.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>I prefer this toon with Expertise and Improved Expertise rather than Disarm feats.</div></blockquote>\n\nI totally agree with you!  Kharlindale is the same and Expertise/Improved Expertise rocks there too.  I posted this version with Disarm/Improved Disarm to take advantage of the Large Weapon but that's also why I put the (*) next to those feats.  In retrospect, I should've kept Expertise/Improved Expertise in the post and said Disarm/Improved Disarm was a variant, LOL!<br/>\n<blockquote><div>EDIT: Cool story btw!</div></blockquote>\n\nThanks, I missed this the first time around!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Of the builds I've screened so far, this is one of the best.\u00a0 Good work!<br/>\n<br/>\n As Max has already suggested, it could easily be modified to finesse kukris into another strong build of different construction.\u00a0 However...<br/>\n<br/>\n I've played several servers and campaigns in the past that provide either a one-time forge or some other once-and-done quest reward for gaining a single uber weapon that can be acquired in no other manner. For dual-wielders that creates a problem since only the mainhand will have those properties during attack.\u00a0 A two-ended weapon solves that dilemma.\u00a0 Naturally, you won't have the s/s switch available but the extra attacks seem to compensate well as flankers can be dispatched more quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\n The only change I would suggest is trading in most of the empathy for Spellcraft because the only issue that seems dangerous are the saves.\u00a0 At least with 18 ranks of Spellcraft (20 w/INT mod), you'd get all your saves above 20 vs. spells which would make a significant difference when facing non-physical damage attacks and auras.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n This bias is based mostly on my own experience testing out empathy on the servers I've frequented where beasts never seem to spawn in the situations where they would provide the best support and tend to get feared or re-dominated A LOT.\u00a0 Also, with Take 20, you really don't need to max the skill anyway.\u00a0 Unless you run into lots of candidate beasties with more than 10HD, then you might need more, but 10-20 modified ranks should be plenty.<br/>\n<br/>\n In any event, I really like this concept and glad you posted it.<img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/6.gif\"/></div>"
