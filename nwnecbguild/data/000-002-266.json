      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">As the builder who designed the Demolition Man, I can vouch for these tweaks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe world for which I built him had some cool custom specifics for archers, like, for example, the possibility of using Darkfire on Arrows and GMW on bows, which made the sniping option that much more attractive, but if you want to make him more of a caster, perhaps you should also take feats as Empower and Extend spells, because they add versatility to the build and spellbook. Still Spell and Maximize as well. Go for broke, brother!<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
