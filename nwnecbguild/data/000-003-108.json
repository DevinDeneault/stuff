      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hey guys,<br/>\n<br/>\n So I'm looking to make my first assassin. He will be pvp focused from RP value, but I also want something that won't kill me to level and is fairly versitile for PVE as well, but main focus will be RP PVP. I would prefer a human as far as race, but am flexible.<br/>\n<br/>\n A little information about Arelith;<br/>\n<br/>\n It is a level 30 capped world and one must take 3 levels consecutively of any new class. You are able to purchace gifts (Ie. +2 strength) At the cost of ECL. I do not care what my character's ECL will be so gifts are an option. Forgive me if I'm leaving anything out of here.<br/>\n<br/>\n I would like a high DA DC, but if that screws with the build too much well I'm willing to be flexible. Oh HIPs occures at level 5 with shadow dancer now instead of level one on the Arelith server if that is put into the build.<br/>\n<br/>\n (I am very flexible on this, please give me your suggestions)<br/>\n<br/>\n THANKS!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
