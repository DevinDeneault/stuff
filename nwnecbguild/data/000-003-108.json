You nailed it.<br/>\n<br/>\n IIRC my suggestion for the Lvl 30 DS request was a starting spread of STR10, DEX8, CON10,WIS18,INT16,CHA 8.\u00a0 Monks gets Cleave without STR prereq, all combat abilities get overwritten anyway and the WF was always intended to be a merely sacrificial prereq for CoT.\u00a0 The extra skill points from INT16 I used to xclass the trap skills.\u00a0 I thought the idea of a dragon leaning over to disable all traps and pick all locks (can't use picks so must be a somewhat higher intrinsic level to be effective) while in stealth mode would look comical (and it does!) but enough points for the native form to recover them all for a free supply or to sell at a Blackmarket store.<br/>\n<br/>\n I also liked the extra stuns with so few monk levels but used my \"extra\" feats for stealth SkFocus rather than to boost casting effectiveness since the size modifier has negative effects on those skills.\u00a0 Went with Search rather than Empathy because that feat is so buggy on most servers and traps are the dragon's bane, especially Negative ones.\u00a0 Also, the dominated targets seem to just stand around looking coy rather than deflecting attack threats and soaking up your XP rewards.\u00a0 Could be a CEP rescript issue, I suppose.\u00a0 Dunno. but it is seldom worthwhile outside of vanilla content.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n The only skill missing is Listen.\u00a0 Dragon's true sight will catch the opposed stealthers but can only spot enemies using Greater Sanctuary by the sound when they move. The ultra WIS level helps to offset the detection size penalty (just like it does with stealth skills).<br/>\n<br/>\n Zen archery?\u00a0 Meh.\u00a0 I'd use spells, buffed pal and wild/elemental shapes until the goal was in sight.\u00a0 An awakened pal buffed with GMF does incredibly well against DR types. I suppose you could throw a buffed summon in the mix as well but the party of two is usually good enough for most tasks.\u00a0 The key is in finding a way to protect against fear until level 16.\u00a0 The Will save is pretty good for the druid but not so for their furball ally which runs like it was set on fire when feared.\u00a0 Watch out for those mummies!<br/>\n<br/>\n Toughness...\u00a0 also a good choice for any dedicated polymorph build.\u00a0 I've seen people throw in Weapon Finesse to help their badger and Air Elemental when they use shapes in confined areas. Don't recall if I did that or not, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n I believe Stonehold can be resisted with Clarity pots or any sort of mind protection but haven't tested this stuff in quite a while so have no records to support that.<br/>\n<em>edit: yah. Stonehold is easily resisted by any method used to apply immunity of mind effects to the weak-willed including Clarity and standard creature skins.</em><br/>\n<br/>\n I think the main difference in my version was going heavier caster pre-epic while manuevering feats for polymorphs.\u00a0 Something like dru16/mnk4 with Dru 17 at 21 and then CoT1-6 for a quick WIS ramp-up for AC bonus and SF DC boosts for the shapes. It doesn't matter whether you take your WF in pre-epic or not because it has no value beyond the class prereq. You'll never achieve more than 3 APR (that's the native progression obviously) in a 30-level DS build so it doesn't matter how you get to BAB 15.\u00a0 Gaining access to Nature's Balance during pre-epic can help lots against arcane threats (and the extra slots don't hurt either).<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway... that's all from my recall.\u00a0 Problem is, I can't remember if it was a build suggestion on the ECB, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook or some other venue.\u00a0 Since BSN folded, the NWN community has spread out all over the Net.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>edit: confirmed some spell-specific information a few lines above.</em></div></div>"

      "content": "<div>It certainly looks like a lot of effort went into that section. I cannot imagine how long it would've take to categorise all of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n I agree: at the end of the day, the goal is for players to have the knowledge to design builds for themselves, not just copy other's ideas. In that regard, having a library of resources that goes through the process, close by to a library of builds that could be used for reference, certainly encourages a DIY approach to character building.<br/>\n<br/>\n And yes, sometimes people just want a build that they can pick out like a bag of sweets, and don't take the time to try and digest a forum properly.<br/>\n<br/>\n I first posted the Battlemage/witch build on the Bioware forums at the beginning of this year, and once it died tried to post it onto the NWN GoG forum [seemed like a place that new players would stop at], before being directed here. In that regard, I rushed into things unaware of the structural standard builds are held to, a standard for which is helpful for categorising and comparing them side by side.<br/>\n<br/>\n I also missed out on reading key components of the forums before I did so [for e.g. the table of contents], which if I'd taken the time would've directed me to the library of builds a lot sooner. For which I made a little bit of a fool out of myself asking silly questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n So! Having learnt from my mistakes, I might try and focus on adding a few polished characters into the Epic Build archive when I get the chance. I've played in a few neighbourhoods over the years and can still see some interesting builds that I've encountered that are not currently in the Old or New Archive.
