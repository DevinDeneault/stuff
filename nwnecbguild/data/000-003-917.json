But how about bard levels high enough to get 4th level spells at I think 10th level bard, for better bard spells/song?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat brings Assassin levels down to about 19 to 24 which I would think would still be pretty good.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about using a shortsword, rapier, instead of dagger?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about Whirlwind Attack, Circle Kick, to full monty your attacks per round?<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about Disarm, Improved Disarm, Knockdown, improved knockdown, Improved Critical on either dagger, shortsword, rapier?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some of my thoughts<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your help, thoughts, etc.</div>"

      "content": "<div>SD is there for HIPS. You also get evasion from the second level. But the second level is only there because it adds +1 to BAB as opposed to a 9th bard level.<br/>\nI squeeze in as many assassin levels as possible. \u00a0That gives the best Death attack DC, maxes out Death attack damage. It also provides max bonus feats for Great dex X and a final dex of 38 for a fighter like AB of +43. AC is also above par. <br/>\nAn 8/8/4 split pre epic would have gained +1 BAB, but here AB becomes more than high enough with all the Great dex feats.<br/>\nIn short: This is an assassin build.<br/>\nBard is there to qualify for assassin. <br/>\nBard + SD levels = 10 because you can only take 10 assassin levels per epic. (I think Bard8/ SD2 is better than Bard6 SD4). You just get lvl3 bard spells. Choose wisely. Perform 15 just gives you the lvl 8 Song. Nothing major, but nice to have.</div>",

To me it seems like you want too much in and end up with a weaker build.<br/>\nAssassin is best with as many levels as possible.  25 levels may be OK, but more is better.<br/>\nIf you want ED, Rogue is often better than SD. Builds with many SD lvls are rare. But you see some that aim at ED and SCV. <br/>\nIn the build I posted here, Bard works as a stepping stone for Assassin and SD.<br/>\nMore serious Bard builds often have 16, 20, 24 or 26 bard levels. The songs are main focus, Skills are also important. Magic plays a part in Bard builds, but even so, spells are not a #1 priority. <br/>\nIn a build with priority on Bard, I prefer Rogue over Assasin.</div>",

      "content": "<div>Now that I think of it, 3 more bard levels, from 8 to 11 only gives you 1 more spells level from 4th to 5th level spells, and +2 AC.<br/>\n<br/>\n3 more Assassin Levels from 24 to 27 equals 2,3,4 more Great Dexterity epic feats which about equals, maybe even exceeds getting 1 more spell level, +2 AC from song.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I am not giving up my HIPS, uncanny dodge, evasion, summon shadow, shadow evade, defensive roll from 5 levels of shadowdancer.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd 5 levels of rogue is not better then 5 levels of shadowdancer. Yes rogue gets a couple, few, some of the same things as shadowdancer, but still the rogue does not get summon shadow, shadow evade, HIPS.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd going from 27 to 30 level in Assassin , and 1,2 more great dexterity feats, is not worth losing summon shadow, shadow evade, defensive Roll by only going with 2 levels of Shadowdancer, 3 levels less then Shadowdancer 5.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo after thinking about it<br/>\n<br/>\n40th level build<br/>\n<br/>\nBard 8(4th level spells, improved bard song)<br/>\n<br/>\nAssassin 27<br/>\n<br/>\nShadowdancer 5<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso you dont have to go with the absolute maxed out full monty. When you do that, the build is not as well rounded, less versatile, can have a, or more weaknesses, less complementary, synergistical, cooperative, interchangeable, abilities that work well with other abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many times that I used a too narrow, too optimized, too full montied character against itself, as a DM, by throwing things at its weaknesses that it couldnt deal with, mitigate, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the flip side you dont want to be too WATERED down.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither Bard 11/Assassin 24/Shadowdancer 5<br/>\n<br/>\nOr <br/>\n<br/>\nBard 8/Assassin 27/shadowdancer 5<br/>\n<br/>\nNeither of those 2 builds Level allotment wise is too watered down, and instead is, are still semi optimized, semi narrow, semi almost full monty, semi focused, semi synergistical<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd both builds have good enough versatility, that they can deal with, mitigate some build weakness, that they might not be able to deal with if were more narrow, focused, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, the summon shadow, combined with summon monster spell combined with henchman, helps deal with Hordes, helps take the HEAT off you, so that can survive longer, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd thats just the summon shadow.<br/>\n<br/>\nShadow Evade adds +3 to +4 to +5 to AC, combine that with +2 to AC from bard, and your AC goes from the 53 you listed to 60, 7 points better.<br/>\n<br/>\nDefensive Roll adds a lot to your AC(+5 to +15 on average depending on what roll to your AC<br/>\n<br/>\nNow your AC goes from 53 to 60 to 65 to 75 AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know \"Dont care about AC, because Ambush, Assassinate, Insta Kill IF undetected\".<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what happens IF that doesnt work?<br/>\n<br/>\nYour going to want a high AC like 75.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo gaining 3 to 6 levels of Assassin to Assassin 27 to 30 from 24, and being able to \"KILL EVEN MORE ON TOP OF THE KILL MORE YOU ARE A LITTLE TINY BIT SLIGHTLY BETTER\"  is not going to make up for losing 3 shadowdancer levels, 3 bard levels, and what lose in losing a spell level, +2 to AC song, Shadow evade + to AC, Defensive Roll to AC, Summon Shadow.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts like you deal 1 zillion damage, way more then enough, and now you want to deal 100 more damage instead of getting nice shiny things that augment, complement, synergize, give you versatility, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts also like if you had a 100 AC, almost impossible to be hit, and you want to add 25 to 50 more to 100 AC for 125 to 150 AC by adding 3 to 6 more levels of a certain class, instead of adding versatility, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen is enough, enough?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen can you diversify, add versatility, etc?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know there are builds that are WATERED down too much, and that that is a legit concern, and that you dont want to WATER down the build, but I am not WATERING down the build.</div>"

      "content": "<div>I'm new to the forum, but not so new to the NVWN 1 game, as I EASILY beat the OC, Shadows of, Hotu, but havent played the game in about 10 years.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince new to forum I dont know how to, not good at, posting a build in a organized, broke down way, and it takes a long time, since I am a slower typer.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, while I now have an idea of what level allotment I want, I dont know exactly what I want to put into the level allotment shell. I have a rough idea, but not enough to post a organized breakdown<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to your question on would the build be better met if chose another class?<br/>\n<br/>\nI was building a monk/Assassin/Shadowdancer<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I noticed that the lack of either a druid or wizard in the build made it so that couldnt buff up the character as much, liked I liked with a similar Monk/Wizard/Rogue, amd Monk/Druid/Rogue builds<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem was couldnt have a Monk/Wizard or Druid/Assassin/Shadowdancer build.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also tried Rogue/Assassin/Shadowdancer, but again I saw buffing was needed, and couldnt get buffing with a Assassin/Shadowdancer build, unless either did a Bard or Wizard or Sorcerer Shadowdancer/Assassin build.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso the bard was showing up prominently in the Bard/RDD/PM builds<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Bard is a better choice then Druid, Wizard, because can sing buff, spell buff, can heal, can wear armor, shields, ok weaponry, better base attack, almost as good as the monk, offers good skill point allotment, and is similar, offers similar enough synergy to the Assassin/Shadowdancer classes<br/>\n<br/>\nSo by going with a bard/Assassin/Shadowdancer it is like going with.either a rogue, or Monk, wixard, shadowdancer, Assassin, all rolled into 1. <br/>\n<br/>\nBest synergy, versatility, optimization with Bard/Assassin/Shadowdancer over almost any X/Assassin/Shadowdancer combo.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought Shadow Evade was at least a base of +2 plus the ocassional +1 per every so many SD levels<br/>\n<br/>\nBut probably misremembered it. It has been awhile. I dont play multiplayer, PW, at least not yet, or only 1 to 3 times at most.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as Defensive roll I thought it either was to roll a D20 to add result to AC or like Parry to roll D20 to parry a attack. At least that what I remember from my days playing this game and on PNP as a player and a DM. Probably wrong about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut COLLECTIVELY combined together, I think Summon Shadow at 3rd SD lv, Shadow Evade at 4th SD lv, and Defense Roll at 5th SD level, and +2 AC, 1 more spell level to go from 4th to 5th level spells, ALL combined together, in a VOLTRONIC combining to form Voltron effect is WORTH 3 to 6 levels less of Assassin.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also just think 30 levels of Assassin is just too much. Especially considering that some multiplayer/PW has a level cap at 30.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut anything less then 24 to 27 Assassin levels and miss out on a lot of great dexterity feats.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Let me try &amp; answer your questions one-by-one,<br/>\n<br/>\na) Aielund is a mod. It is a player-created content that you can download &amp; play it for free, like any other module(except the premium Bioware ones). <br/>\nThere is a place for these modules &amp; other cool stuff and it is called Neverwinter Nights Vault. The link is below,<br/>\nNeverwinter Nights Vault =&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://neverwintervault.org/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nb) Aielund &amp; any other module that exists for Neverwinter Nights, play wherever the main game plays. <br/>\nIf Beamdog made Neverwinter Nights available for smartphones or tablets then the modules will play on them too.<br/>\nWhere the main engine plays, the modules will play as well, in other words. Here is a link to our forums where we discuss Aielund, <br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-aielund-saga-t515487.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the-aielund-saga-t515487.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nc) Aielund is co-op as well, I have played it with friends and I have played it as a single player experience and both times rocked. It is not PvP but PvE (player versus environment).<br/>\nWhen you play in single player there are henchmen/henchwomen that you can take with you &amp; they are not the dumb ones that OC has but smart and resourceful.<br/>\nAnd there are plenty of them too. <br/>\n<br/>\nAielund as Max shouts in the module's thread is the greatest single player module that has ever been created for Neverwinter Nights.<br/>\nIn fact, it's so good that the author (Savant) has published a book about it. You can find it on Amazon as usual.<br/>\n<br/>\nd) Favoured Soul, Soul Knife &amp; Psychic Warrior are not in Aielund since it supports only the default classes.<br/>\nYou can add these classes with a hak-pack that it was popular back in the day (although it severely disturbed game balance) the PRC.<br/>\nMost people had problems with it though &amp; it is not easy to intergrade. <br/>\nYou can approach these classes philosophy however with the proper builds, it isn't that hard.<br/>\n<br/>\ne) Now, I don't remember if Aielund allows for conflicted alignments, we will need the help of Empyre or Mick or Stagmeister here, they have played it more times than I.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, if you do not know how to install those modules then don't hesitate to ask for help. <br/>\nNeverwinter Nights has an incredible amount of really good modules (Bastard of Kosigan, Diablo - the Lord of Terror, Prophet, Swordflight, etc) and I suggest that you start playing those instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Went to the Vault again. Looked at Aielund. Went to download files section. Says need CEP, hakpacks, and the main files for each act, are in .rar extensions. If click these file download links, they will download to PC and Hybrid Tablet PC's, but they wont download to Android Smart Phones. And even if they could, probably would not be able to install as would probably would have to MANUALLY install.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Smartphones are usually not designed to manually install. Usually you download from google play, or Amazon, or whatever source, then it auto installs after finished downloading. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat probably cant, wont happen with CEP, HAK PACK, .rar files that are usually designed for computer.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo unless you can help me, its probably a no.<br/>\n<br/>\nToo bad, looks like a good series of mods.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf Aielund wants Mobile Smart Phone players, its probably going to want to make it so that can go to either google play, or Amazon, download the required batch of files(CEP, HAK, .RAR), in a batch program, that can download, auto install from google play, Amazon.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that also probably goes for the mods that dont come with the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that will probably take time, as NVWN 1 EE, came out on Android mobile smart phones, tablets, on google play about 2 months ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso the mobile smart phone, tablet version of the NVWN 1 EE game does not have the DM client, Aurora, mod creator.<br/>\n<br/>\nNVWN1 EE on PC has those things, but tablet, smart phones do not<br/>\n<br/>\nSo since the game on Smart phone dont have what the PC versions have, that why the other mods section on the game launcher, is empty, and why only have the main mods that come with the game, and why cant seem to download, install, play custom, community mods like Aielund.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo probably will have to wait and or go without.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if there is a way, I dont see it, and will probably need some help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it seems like 99% of players playing this game are on PC, Hybrid PC tablets, as there are no topics, on this and beamdog forums, and have not gotten any responses to me asking for help on, about this issue<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it looks like its the main mods, multiplayer/PW list that came with game, unless you, others can help</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hey thanks Valerfor, I might try that. Century Link says that somebody either has to die(their words), or cancel, stop their, service, etc, before we can get internet where we are. Century Link is only provider in area.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut maybe can use Mobile Wifi Hotspot to download the content to computer, then try what you say to try.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe can try that some other time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried, am playing Arolith from the Multiplayer PW list. They have a server with mods, DM sessions running constantly that does not require me to install anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the only reason playing there is to build a Monk/Bard/Assassin, as they allow that combination, lawful bards.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut RP is enforced, the time, rest, food, and water system drain your stats, if dont rest, eat, drink water in time. And even rats are, can be tough. You level up slower, after the first 2 near free level ups. And have to get 3 bard levels before will let me take monk level at level 4. There are server errors, glitchs, fast respawn rates that caused my character to die 2 times. You lose gold(unless banked), small amount of xp, every time die, and respawn at beginning of game.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey have a bonus gift, feat like system, at character creation. I took a +2 Dexterity gift that adds +1 ECL(Makes you earn more xp to level up) And a +4 to Hide, +4 to Move Silently gift(No + to ECL), +6 to Perform(no + to ECL)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso beginning to think healing potions are either Almost non existent, an or dont want healing potions at lower level. Can't even find healing potions for sale by merchants, and if there were, sure they would cost like 1000 to 5000 gold for 1 cure light wounds potion.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut maybe thats because almost everyone can supposedly create items, potions, etc, by spending crafting points from creation, level up, on crafting skills, and then finding the right materials, then sometimes paying gold, to make item.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso if use any kind of magic, must have a deity, must pray to that deity occasionally and must pay at least 100 gold occassionally if want higher level spells to work.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo my Monk/Bard/Assassin projected build is:<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 3<br/>\n<br/>\nHalfling Bard<br/>\n<br/>\n5142 Xp(amost to 6000 xp level up to level 1 monk)<br/>\n<br/>\nLE<br/>\n<br/>\nAC 17(21)<br/>\n<br/>\nHP 18<br/>\n<br/>\nSaves<br/>\n<br/>\nReflex 8<br/>\n<br/>\nWill 7<br/>\n<br/>\nCon 1,2<br/>\n<br/>\nBAB +2(+6,7)<br/>\n<br/>\nStats<br/>\n<br/>\nStr 10<br/>\n<br/>\nDex 16(18(Dex gift +2 dex)<br/>\n<br/>\nCon 10<br/>\n<br/>\nInt 12<br/>\n<br/>\nWis 16<br/>\n<br/>\nCha 12<br/>\n<br/>\nFeats<br/>\n<br/>\nDodge, Weapon Finesse<br/>\n<br/>\nSkills<br/>\n<br/>\nConcentration 2<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscipline 3<br/>\n<br/>\nHeal 1<br/>\n<br/>\nHide 6(14(+4 dex+4 gift)<br/>\n<br/>\nMove Silently 5(13 (+4 dex+ 4 gift)<br/>\n.<br/>\nPerform 3(10(+1 cha +6 gift)<br/>\n<br/>\nSpellcraft 2<br/>\n<br/>\nTumble 2,3<br/>\n<br/>\nUMD 2<br/>\n<br/>\nParry 1<br/>\n<br/>\nListen 2</div>"
