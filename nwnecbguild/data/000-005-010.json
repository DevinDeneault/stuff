      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I don't play Arelith either so probably a better-informed source would be a player who has played there a lot to know what can best be exploited. \u00a0BTW, if this is not a finished, tested build, you should post it first in Unfinalized or folks will assume it is one with all the bugs worked out. \u00a0Actually, it seems pretty close to that now. \u00a0You've accounted for most all of what you need.<br/>\n<br/>\n Your AB is about as high as it can go if you want to qualify for EDR. \u00a0And pretty good for Arelith I think.<br/>\n<br/>\n Some things to consider:<br/>\n<br/>\n With EDR, high CON &amp; Expertise going for you, I believe this build mimics a fighter wall so would swap out Imp Exp for IKD (personal bias and since you've already got the INT prereq). \u00a0The thing I've found using Imp Exp with non-caster is that if enemies flank you and you feel a need for the extra 5 AC over standard Exp, you'll be attacking at +26/+21/+16/+11 non-hasted and probably be missing at least half of the time, especially in PvP who will likely have their own high AC to begin with. \u00a0I say stay as offensive as possible, put the elevated AB to work, force the opposition to try to avoid all the crits (and there SHOULD be a lot to contend with) and rely on your DR &amp; HP soak to keep you alive while making a lot of successful attacks and crit opps.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Even if you take a rogue level dump @30, you will suffer scroll casting failure with high-level scrolls. \u00a0ATM, w/o CHA-boosting gear, you will be hitting UMD of 28 to cast only level 3 spells w/o failure.\u00a0 You'll need a modified UMD of at least 34 (or is it 33? \u00a0I forget)\u00a0 to get that high assuming Arelith uses the default scroll casting check. \u00a0You'd know that better than me of course. \u00a0BTW, you should list UMD in your skill list. \u00a0I'm guessing you allocated 30 ranks, modified to 28 via CHA.<br/>\n<br/>\n Though there is no restriction to alignment on the build I would recommend \"Any neutral\"\u00a0as protection vs. smiters.<br/>\n<br/>\n Your low Will save (15 vs. spells) may prove problematic vs. necromatic arcanists and clerics using negative energy. \u00a0Typically, that damage type is seldom resistable swo could become a factor especially with Fear spams. \u00a0The only thing I can thing of offhand is to test the build out a bit, decide if that AS +2 AC is making a huge difference. \u00a0If not a big issue and you are getting taunted regularly, you shift all those \"handy\" skills points (DT &amp; OL specifically) and a few from heal to max Conc @31 and then swap out Armor Skin for ESkF: Conc. \u00a0With all your CON, you will win all the taunt checks guaranteed. \u00a0But that is more of a PvP design vs. specific kinds of opponents.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm curious what weapon you are considering. \u00a0I'm guessing either rapier or scimi, perhaps longsword.<br/>\n<br/>\n I like the build overall and I think you gave it a lot of thought. \u00a0All that's needed now is some testing and it should be good to go.<img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Maybe Iron Will instead of ImpExp, but even that might not make a difference.<br/>\n As for the weapons, I consider either scimitar or warhammer/battleaxe. Scimitar is best against low-AC enemies.

For PvE builds, it's preferable to outline the significant nuances of the server that you intend to take advantage of so others considering the build can easily tweak it for their own situation. Just as one example where skill allocation is considered... a few servers I've played supplied heal kits as the basic HP restoration device, few (if any) potions and significant rest limitations. So, on those servers it would be wise to allocate as many spare (non-power) skill ranks in Heal as you can afford. Yet... on other servers, the Heal skill is all but worthless.\n<blockquote><div>\u00a0According to my calculations, 16-20x4 profile (axe, WM) does 20% less damage per round than 10-20x3 (scimitar, WM) when enemy has negligible AC.<br/>\n This difference becomes 13% when enemy AC is 10 better than your AB, still in favor of scimitar.<br/>\n Parity happens around AC ~ AB+13, and after that axe is 5-10% better that scimitar, evening out again when you begin to hit only on rolls of 20<br/>\n .<br/>\n Basically, this happens when wide crit of scimitar becomes useless because you can't crit when you can't hit.</div></blockquote>\n Yes, this is a mantra I carry throughout all my non-caster building. In the same vein, the availability of the Keen property can change the whole weapon consideration thought process. If you can forge Keen onto say, a club, then the value of using Keen Edge scrolls (you did infer that UMD would be one of your strengths, right?) is neutralized. Never figured out how the elven smiths sharpened those blunt weapons to cleave orc necks better, but NWN uses that property globally.\n<blockquote><div>Powergaming wise, scimitar is better unless you are building specifically to fight against monsters/players with such high AC.<br/>\n On the other hand, scimitar is often frowned upon on RP servers, as its an easy powergaming choice.</div></blockquote>\n Agreed (as I replied to Dante, above). The number of RP environments I have played I can count on one hand while holding a flashlight. I need to run or I quickly get bored as a gourd. But that is just my own bias. Didn't realize a scimi could be controversial. Rapier and kukri, too?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
