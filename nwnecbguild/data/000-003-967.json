Translating his stats and skills from 2nd to 3rd ed is another challenge.<br/>\n He\u2019s male and human \u2013 that\u2019s the easy part.<br/>\n In BG 1 he\u2019s neutral good and in BG 2 he\u2019s chaotic good. In my opinion he is definitely CG!<br/>\n<br/>\n His stats in BG 1 are STR 18/93 DEX 15 CON 15 INT 8 WIS 6 CHA9. In BG 2 the DEX and CON are increased to 16.<br/>\n These are 2.ed stats and they cannot be translated directly to 3.ed rules, NWN and the point buy system. The stat bonuses work differently in 2. and 3. ed. and you can\u2019t get 18,15,15,8,6,9 with 30 points. Anyway I see him as a STR based \u201cfighter type\u201d, primarily ranger with low mental stats.<br/>\n In BG 1 his weapon proficiencies are Large sword, Longbow and Axe. In BG 2 his proficiencies are Two handed sword, Longbow, Axe, Mace and Two weapon fighting.<br/>\n Minsc has no ranger spells, or any other magic, so wisdom should be below 10 and no UMD spellcasting.<br/>\n He had \"charm animal\" as a special ability. Perhaps animal empathy covers that.<br/>\n 2nd ed. rangers had stealth as a class skill. But somehow I don't see Minsc as the \"silent type\" sneaking about.<br/>\n Minsc had the rage ability \"berserk\". His rage seemed somehow to be linked to his pet, Boo, the feracious miniature, giant space hamster. I don't know how to apply that, but barbarian will give the rage ability.<br/>\n Big rangers don't need big animal companions, and Minsc kept his underneath his shirt, or somewhere out of sight... But if you want to display the animal, the closest you get is the dire rat, the only rodent companion - unless sombody knows a \"hamster hak\" out there.<br/>\n His favored enemies in BG were gnolls and vampires. That should easily be covered with the abundant amount of FEs in NWN.<br/>\n Minsc was on a mission to protect Dynaheir when we first met him. Later she went missing again and Jaheira tried to influence him, always behaving like everybody's big sister. Maybe she even succeeded in recruiting him to her organization - or maybe not. I wonder what NWN damsel he would protect; Linu, Aribeth, Dorna or Sharwyn, but most probably not Nathyrra.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Edit: I am tempted to give him Iron will and maybe even epic will just to reflect his stubbornness.</em><br/>\n<br/>\n Now, before I post anything that resembles a build, I want your feedback and ideas that can be taken into a Minsc build.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Minsc is a character that most people would want in a party or even as a friend. What's not to like about him? He is strong in a fight and loyal to his friends, plus he is not a meddler of any kind. I think he is the equivalent of \"Gimli son of Gloin\" in Baldur's Gate saga. Now, when it comes to his NWN incarnation we need to think not only what his obvious traits are but also what was intended by his creators. I will list some examples as to what i am talking about below.<br/>\n<br/>\n a) Minsc traditional weapon was the Halberd. This is the weapon that comes with in BG1. But if we look in BG2 he has a \"destined\" for him, two-handed sword that talks and a whole bunch of dialog written for that purpose, named \"Lilarcor\". I would pick one or the other doesn't really matter and although he could dual-wield i think the stereotype of the big-and-strong guy goes better with a two-handed weapon, i would rate slightly higher the Greatsword for NWN purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\n b) Minsc despite his head wound that had the side-effrect to reduce his wisdom to below average levels, could quite efficiently cast ranger spells (or divine spells from the appropriate spheres for DnD 2nd Ed), we can see that in BG2, and he never dropped from Ranger status despite his illegal mental scores (you would need 13 wisdon to be a Ranger in 2nd Ed). In fact Minsc in the \"Throne Of Bhaal\" expansion is considered to be one of the best tanks in the game for this synergy: (Armour Of\u00a0 Faith, Hardiness, Defender Of Eastheaven). That offered an 80-85% of total physical Dmg. Reduction and key to that combo was his divine spell, \"Armour Of Faith\". To me, he needs full Ranger spells for NWN purposes.<br/>\n<br/>\n Minsc's alignment is the very definition of CG if you ask me. Some 2nd Ed. DnD adventures had CONAN be CG also, but i think he is more of a CN type than anything else. Now, Minsc's class is a tougher choice. He is definitely a Ranger we have established that, and we obviously must include Barbarian to represent his uncontrollable (and often fatal, sigh) rages.. But what about (if any) his third class? Frrom what we know about basic character building we ideally need a third class with \"tumble\" as a class skill if we are about to make him a \"good-playable character\", or else the lack of AC will kill him fast. Personally, i am in favour of a few levels of Bard in there. Both Rogue and Bard could work fine but i think that Bard's ability to have maximum ranks in spellcraft too, better represents the \"Barbarian's Superstition\" and thus resistance to spells-weavers. Another debate could be made for the selection or not of \"Devastating Critical\" in this build. This should be the natural evvolution for a really strong guy but i think that the only person that really justifies that feat is \"Sarevok\" with his \"deathbringer assaut\" special ability. For all the others-and-Minsc, i would say a big strength score plus the Ranger's FE's bonusses are more than enough for the job.<br/>\n<br/>\n I will stop here and see what you will do with these parameters in mind Mick, and i am more than happy to debate each point with you.<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Your 16 CON is what i would have put there as well, Minsc was a robust warrior, and you kept maximum human strength as well. This Ranger can deliiver some really powerful hits, (4d6 +28/ 17-20 x2) - ouch! Mick, i feel your build is the most \"thematically correct\" for Minsc and for that reason i will rest my case since i believe Minsc himself would be pleased with the results. If i had to make two suggestions, only two for the whole build is to steal two points from DEX and put them in INT so you start with both DEX (10) and INT (10). Then you take a second level of Barbarian at the end and max \"Taunt\". My second suggestion would be to take \"Blind fight\" instead of \"Cleave\" at the beginning.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That was quite a challenge, especially how to emulate the Blade class. He is a dual-wielding bard with two shortswords. The bard songs do to some degree add to attack and damage like the spins of the blade class. But I wanted to add more. I found that the divine wrath of CoT was what looked most like the offensive spin, especially if you add ki damage and the crits from weapon master. The spell war cry also adds something that resemles offensive spin. Defensive spin is covered by expertise, song AC, tumble and the concealment from the displacement or improved invisivility spell.<br/>\n CoT is there only for game mechanical reasons, I dont see Haer' Dalis as a divine character at all. I tried to find room for some tiefling traits as well. Bluff and taunt should reflect parts of his personality. Replace bluff with spellcraft or UMD if you want more of a power-build. I tried to find place for the standard tiefling \"resist energy fire\" before i realized that Haer' dalis didn't have any resistances in BG2.<br/>\n He should buff dex with cat's and wear a

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Mick, thou art a diamond - couldn't wish for a better Xmas prezzie!<br/>\n<br/>\n If I may make a couple of contributions to the Minsc-build conversation, they would be:<br/>\n<br/>\n i) Boo isn't really an issue, as he is never seen in BG1 or 2 outside Minsc's 'doll' (much to my disappointment, but you can't have everything), and I'm positive he would take no other animal companion<br/>\n<br/>\n ii) I suspect Minsc's NG status in BG1 is down to his affinity with nature and, thereby, druids, who in BG1 have to play as true neutral, while Dynaheir, as his witch is LG, hence the 'good'. His CG conversion is (aside from his personality), I am sure, is down to the too many blows to the head and somehow equating his childlike (not childish) joy of life to a 'chaotic' characterization.<br/>\n<br/>\n iii) The prime purpose of Minsc's D'Jema (spelling?) was to bring him membership of the berserker lodge in Rasheman, which he would accomplish by his secondary purpose, to accompany and keep safe Dynaheir (hence his buggering off if you remove Dynaheir from the party. Hate to say it, but I have sacrificed her several times in the Bandit Camp in BG1 - had her cast fireball on entering the main camp tent while alone. Of course, I could just have parked in a house in Beregost/Naskel, but an heroic death seemed more fitting.). If you get the final cut-scenes at the end of BG2 ToB, you are told that he achieved his prime goal, and, indeed, established his own Berserker lodge. So he definitely needs Barbarian in NwN, in the absence of Berserker.<br/>\n<br/>\n iv) I find it interesting that in BG2, the Dynaheir-less Minsc adopts Aerie the faerie - sorry, Avariel - as his new witch, and also clearly adores Keldorn's nature - both of whom are LG, like Dynaheir was. I don't know if that tells us anything, but...<br/>\n<br/>\n v) While it is true that Minsc has access to all the available Ranger spells in BG, my 'feel' of the character is that they come through his joy in nature, rather than clerical discipline, as Bard would probably be a grand addition to a build for him. However - and I'm afraid I'm dismissing classic Rogue, there's absolutely nothing to indicate he would possess any of the Rogue's traits - I find I'm running out of room - he's a Ranger, he's a Fighter (full-plate and packing steel), he's a Barbarian (possibly mergeable), he's a Bard, he's a Harper Scout??!! In a way, it's a shame he can't be a Dwarven Defender, because they embody much of Minsc's 'come and have a go' trait!<br/>\n<br/>\n vi) On a personal level, unless I'm playing a Fighter or Paladin in BG2, I always have Minsc dual-wielding the Crom Faeyr (spelling?) and Mace of Disruption/Flail of Ages/ that axe that \"lops off heads like nobody's business\", so I'm delighted Mick's build keeps the dual-wield option open. As a btw, I've never encountered Minsc with a halberd - every time I first meet him in Nashkel he has a 2-handed sword, and competences that match it.<br/>\n<br/>\n Don't know if any of that helps, I just got excited! Great build looking forward to having a go with it!<br/>\n<br/>\n As to other BG characters: I would see Valygar as katana-wielding ranger and (albeit reluctant) arcane archer, except we'd have to elf him, hmmm...Oh, yes, that could be a Kivan/Valygar mix-up. I mention it as a possibility only because in BG2 (as in NwN, as far as I can see), ranged weapons are of very limited use - and none at all against 'big bosses' - so Kivan would need some melee skills, which Valygar has. Worth a thought, maybe?<br/>\n<br/>\n Others that may be of interest include Coran, Imoen (I always dual-class her to mage in BG1, hence my blowing up of Dynaheir) and, especially, Viconia. Oooh, I've come over all unnecessary!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Your 16 CON is what i would have put there as well, Minsc was a robust warrior, and you kept maximum human strength as well. This Ranger can deliiver some really powerful hits, (4d6 +28/ 17-20 x2) - ouch! Mick, i feel your build is the most \"thematically correct\" for Minsc and for that reason i will rest my case since i believe Minsc himself would be pleased with the results. If i had to make two suggestions, only two for the whole build is to steal two points from DEX and put them in INT so you start with both DEX (10) and INT (10). Then you take a second level of Barbarian at the end and max \"Taunt\". My second suggestion would be to take \"Blind fight\" instead of \"Cleave\" at the beginning.</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">Thank you!<br/>\n Your two suggestions are good. Taunt will improve an already high AB, and stealing a couple of points from dex is all right since you normally can fill the gap with items, spells or pots. You get the harper cat's, but it comes rather late. I kept intelligence low on purpose to match the theme. Blind fight will make you hit more often when blinded and vs concealed creatures. Cleave will make you hit more creatures over all, but is IMO more important at lower levels when you have few attacks per round. A focus I had when building was to get the FE bonus as high as possible and vs as many as possible. Ranger 35 gives 2 bonus feats and increases the FE bonus to +8, so an extra barbarian level would come at the cost of HS 4. I already chose ranger 35 over HS 5 (which gives one bonus feat plus craft harper item) for that reason.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If you want to dual-wield, you should wear light armor so your ranger dual-wield feat will work all right, and you should keep a light (small/tiny) weapon in your off-hand slot. A flail in the main hand and mace in the off hand is possible, but the build only gives you one weapon focus.

I've just been furtling around for Mazzy's stats (I write such things down - pen and paper works for me), and in the same notepad I found some of the info on my first monk in NWN. I then went skittering over to your Blossom on the mage-killer thread to see how they stack up (doesn't look good for me, I'm afraid), and came over all stupid - you cite SR 60 (cannot be reduced), and I realised I don't know what that means. Sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, got Mazzy's details now, so I'll see what I can come up with.<br/>\n<br/>\n Glad you clarified the Arvoreen thing for me - two lumps of stupid this early would not bode well for the rest of my day!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Just click the link for BG2 NPC's and you're done.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>SR </strong>= <strong>S</strong>pell <strong>R</strong>esistance.<br/>\n And what i mean with<em> \"Cannot be Reduced\"</em> is that the ammount of SR he gets is going to stay the same no matter what. That is because Monks can not have their Spell Resistance altered for any reason. Now, that is important because Mages and Druids both, have spells that can reduce their opponents SR in order to help them penetrate their defences, but in this case they can not. To give an actual example of <em>\"Grandmaster Of Flowers\"</em> spell resistance, imagine that a completely pure lvl 40 mage can try 20 times to penatrate his defences and he will only succeed in 1 of them! If he is multi-classed for some reason, even for 1 level he can not affect him at all, no matter how much he tries. That's how tough he is!<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

This gives me hope!<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and I know you like Knockdown (I've now used it once - against the head vampire in HotU - and it worked!), but there seems v little point in Mazzy taking it.

This is one of the problems with reading a manual that only deals with levels 1-20 and doesn't mention prestige classes, and the NwN Wiki didn't help much either. I didn't know that a prestige class wouldn't impact on XP, nor that you only get bonus feats every 4 levels for CoT after 10th. And actually, the 30F/10CoT is much closer to what I was wanting in the first place, so I'll pursue that.<br/>\n<br/>\n How does the below look?<br/>\n<br/>\n Fighter 1-8 (feats at 1[x2], 2, 3, 4, 6[x2], 8) (Int+1 at 4)<br/>\n CoT 9-13 (feats at 9, 10, 12[x2]) (Int+1 at 8, Dex+1 at 12)<br/>\n Fighter 14-18 (feats at 14, 15, 16, 18[x2]) (Dex+1 at 16)<br/>\n CoT 19-21 (feats at 19, 21[x2]) (Int+1 at 20)<br/>\n Fighter 22-28 (feats at 23, 24, 27[x2]) (Int+1 at 24, Dex+1 at 28)<br/>\n CoT 29-30 (feats at 30[x2])<br/>\n Fighter 31-40 (feats at 31, 33[x2], 35, 36, 37, 39[x2])\u00a0 (Dex+1 at 32, 36, 40)<br/>\n<br/>\n This keeps the 35 feats I queried earlier - but correctly, I hope!<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Valerfor - you really are determined to knock Mazzy's Dex down, aren't you ;-)? Tell you what, I'll stick with my initial starting stats but use four of the stat boosts to give her the 14 Int (losing the Str boosts and 2 of the Dex ones - see above). It just seems more elegant, in that I don't have a hanging (odd numbered) stat floating around. I know it's sacrilege, but I'm really not that bothered about Imp Knockdown/Disarm - luxury feats, I feel. Expertise and Imp Expertise stand a better chance of getting in. Anyway, I'll be there to be shot at/dipped in the cauldron soon!<br/>\n<br/>\n Again, thanks for all the help.

Now lets rise her (INT) with manipulation of her initial stats: {STR 13/ DEX 18/ CON 14/ INT 14/ WIS 8/ CHA 8} This now, cost you 1 point. You can make her STR 14 later with spending only one point and you just saved the other three for her Dexterity.<br/>\n<br/>\n Another Example: Human: STR (18) to STR (16) give us 6 points to destribute.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Oh, but i was almost sure of that, i think of you as a raw talent rather. You can see the end result but you just haven't taught of how to achieve that.<br/>\n<br/>\n a) Simply by taking the last three levels of CoT in Epic, at timed intervals (let's say at 25th, 33rd and 40th) you can save the skill points for \"Spot\" and take them when Mazzy reach a CoT level. Don't take it at Fighter levels, only at CoT ones. It's the same \"trick\" we do with many other skills including \"Tumble\" or \"UMD\" and so on... In othr words, normally a Fighter wouldn't have a 43 Spot because the skill is a cross-class (21 ranks max) skill for him, but with CoT levels in Epic, Mazzy can have 43 Spot by 40th level easily.<br/>\n<br/>\n b) The \"<strong>Stacking</strong>\" of Fighter and CoT pre-epic will produce better saves as well. That is because if you look\u00a0 CoT at Wiki, you will see that he has Two) good base saves, not One. A good base save is always +12 (base value. before attributes factored in), a poor base save is always +6. So, what you did by mixing them before Epic levels is that you pumped the overall saving throws of your build even more, that's before<strong> the additional +5</strong> to all saving throws Mazzy will have from her 10 CoT levels! To give you a visual example of how the correct multi-class (as in this case) improves the saves,<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Fighter </strong>Saving Throws<em>(At level 10)</em>: Fort: +7/ Reflex: +3/ Will: +3<br/>\n<strong>CoT </strong>Saving Thows<em>(At level 10)</em>:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fort: +7/ Reflex: +7/ Will: +3<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Fighter </strong>(Single-Class) Saving Thows<em>(At level 20)</em>:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Fort: +12/ Reflex: +6/\u00a0 Will: +6<br/>\n<strong>Fighter/CoT</strong> (Multi-Class) Saving Throws<em>(At level 20)</em>: Fort: +14/ Reflex: +10/ Will: +6 <em>(Again, this is before the +5 universal bonus of CoT to all saving throws)</em><br/>\n<br/>\n c) There are some skills that we try to have them <strong>in any build </strong>that we make. These skills are <strong>Discipline</strong>, <strong>Tumble </strong>and <strong>Spellcraft</strong>.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Discipline </strong>is self-explanatory, if you don't have it then any enemy can knock-you-down and you will never get up till you die. In O.C this might not be the case but believe me, in almost everywhere else is, and there aren't always boots that will make your character immune to knockdown.<br/>\n<strong>Tumble </strong>works in (unmodified by your attributes) brackets of 5 ranks (5, 10, 15 e.t.c). In every such step we get an unconditional +1 AC for our character. Because the AC of our character is very important, we always take this skill even if it is not a \"Class Skill\" for our character.<br/>\n<strong>Spellcraft </strong>works in (modified by your attributes) brackets of 5 ranks (5, 10, 15 e.t.c). In every such step we get an uncoditional +1 to all saving throws Vs spells. Again, this is a very important skill for all characters and thus it's always taken.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now let's go back to Mazzy. As a Fighter she takes 2 skill points/level and the same is true when she levels as a CoT, again 2 skill points/level. You see \"Fighter Classes\" do not get a lot of skill points :/ Thankfully we have 14 Intelligence (+2 modifier) so she will have 4 skill points/level. And look, we also have 4 skill that we want them maxed, be it cross-class or-not. Discipline, Tumble, Spellcraft and Spot. See, how you put all those extra skill points into their place now? :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Background first. Because I've only played Str-based characters before, I've been able to access Overwhelming and Devastating Criticals. I've just found out that this is not the case with a Dex-based build, so find myself with four newly-available feats (I had her going all the way in both shortsword and shortbow) - which is nice in one way. So I wondered about Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, Whirlwind and Improved Whirlwind Attack (I know that's five, but don't worry about that, there's another one I won't lose sleep over dropping)?<br/>\n<br/>\n I understand that Tumble will, by and large, negate the need for (and indeed be better than) Dodge, Mobility and Spring Attack, and that my armour will impact negatively on my Dex bonus. However, Whirlwind and Imp Whirlwind look to be my best bet for hard-ass melee feats. What do you reckon?<br/>\n<br/>\n I think I have the rest of the feats worked out now, together with the skill points distribution, so this 'should' be my last Q before I show Mazzy to the critics for appraisal.

Multiclassing with assassin represents some of what you gained by dual classing with thief. In epic* levels the thief class could pick the Use any item feat, represented by the UMD skill in NWN. Perhaps rogue would have been better with more skillpoints, evasion and a possible improved evasion or crippling strike. But she is eeevil so I gave her an evil signature class. The assassin Improved invisibility\u00a0grants 50% concealment and\u00a0is harder to dispel and better than what you find on scrolls.<br/>\n<br/>\n*She is not in BG2 or ToB, but here I have made a lvl 40 build with epic levels for NWN.<br/>\n(In BG you can make your own henchmen and import them if you play the game in multiplayer, even if you play it alone on your own computer.

I was finalising my Mazzy build when I had an epiphany of sorts, 'cause I was getting a bit concerned about her post-level 30 (in that I was just chucking Great Dex at her with little thought - and even Great Con or Str, just for something different yet helpful). So I thought (bearing in mind my previous enquiry as to dodge, mob, spring and the whirlwinds) what about 7 levels of Weapon Master in shortsword?<br/>\n<br/>\n I know that buggers up pretty much everything I've drawn up to date, but a Fighter 22 (or 23) /CoT11 (or 10) /WM7 seems more 'right' for her somehow - she's very committed to the cause, hence the CoT, but she needs to 'prove' herself (<em>to</em> herself, more than anyone else), so she'd want to push her abilities, and WM seems to give her that. Obviously not with shortbow, but shortsword should be do-able, if odd.<br/>\n<br/>\n Ready to be shot at now - let the wrath of the ECB Guild fall on me...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That could make a <em>huge</em> difference to the build.) shield, and heavy armour (she's a knight, and that's what they wear!). She'll also be using a shortbow (again, least appropriate of all ranged weapons for her species) as and when appropriate. In effect, I've got Pippin in full Gondor war regalia, and that ain't easy.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">This is not poop. You are definitely on the right track. But there are many things you can do to improve the build.<br/>\n The starting stats are all right.\u00a0 The level spread is fine. Both can be different, but what you have will work fine.<br/>\n You can get more AB, you can get better AC, you can improve the saves, get epic dodge earlier and you can get more skillpoints. That is a matter of refining the build.<br/>\n The only thing I spot that is completely wrong is that you try to take defensive roll on a general feat. You have to take it as a bonus feat at rogue lvl 10 or 13. Epic dodge on the other hand, can be taken as a general feat once you meet the prereqs.<br/>\n<br/>\n How to improve the number of skillpoints: Take rogue at level 1 and earn 18 skillpoints. If you start with rogue you get 10 x 4 skillpoints at level 1. If you start with fighter you only get 16 skilpoints at level 1. Later the rogue level will give you 10 skillpoints and the fighter level 4 skillpoints. (40 + 4) - (16 + 10) = 18.<br/>\n<br/>\n What you can do to improve the AB and AC:<br/>\n Rogue pre epic gives a hit to AB. Rogue level 1, level 5, level 9, level 13 and level 17 cost 1 AB each. If you only take 4 rogue levels pre epic and avoid rogue 5 that early, you gain 1 AB. (You would gain one more AB if you waited with rogue until level 21, but I will not advice that.)<br/>\n You take several pre epic feats after lvl 20. If you are more strict with what pre epic feats to take, you free up epic feats for great dex and can improve both AB and AC. You also choose to take 2 great strength feats. If you rather take 2 great dex feats, you will improve AB and AC by 1.<br/>\n<br/>\n How to improve the saves: Replace as many fighter levels as you can with CoT pre epic. CoT pre epic has both reflex and fortitude as primary saves while fighter only has fortitude. Levelling will also be smoother since you get the saves bonus from sacred defence earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\n How to get epic dodge earlier: The earliest you can get epic dodge is at level 27. If you only take 4 levels of rogue pre epic, you can get there by level 30. If you want some CoT/fighter levels for epic bonus combat-feats in early epic levels, you can still get epic dodge by level 33. Don't delay epic dodge. Save the last rogue level for a skill-dump at level 37-39.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I did, at least, manage to get in all the feats I wanted (I know Knockdown &amp; Imp Knockdown are liked by many, but I thought Knockdown was a waste for a halfling and I couldn't afford a wasted feat). Thanks for explaining the Great Dex v Grest Str stuff, I'll confess that I'd initially had Great Dex III and Dex +1 at level 40 and only changed them on a whim.<br/>\n<br/>\n While I understand what you say about Rogue at level 1 for extra skill points, this is Mazzy we're talking about, and I don't think she'd want to start her journey as a Rogue, sorry. A bit of role play kicking in there, I suspect!<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm fine with loading more CoT levels pre-epic, my only concern was whether CoT would enable me to take Fighter specific feats - particularly Weapon Specialisation(s), but also I was wary of taking Imp Crit until I'd hit level 8 in Fighter. Would I now be correct in thinking I could do it in CoT?<br/>\n<br/>\n I hear what you say about Epic Dodge, and had initially tried to get it in earlier, but I was working on a F17/R13/CoT10 at the time. Then I thought, there's a redundant Fighter level, and Rogue 14 gives both Uncanny Dodge IV and a bonus feat if I take it in epic, so I changed.<br/>\n<br/>\n Something still niggles about <em>the</em> Mazzy Fentan taking Rogue at all, but I can work on compromise, and there seems to be little point taking Rogue unless you're going to have 13 or 14 levels in it. Never played a Rogue, never played a halfling, never played a CoT, only had Mazzy in party once - it's a little challenging!<br/>\n<br/>\n Come, men, to the drawing board! (And thanks for not crucifying me.) I will return. Thanks again.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You will not be able to start taking CoT before BAB is +7. So you have most likely\u00a0taken 6 or 7 fighter levels before you get there. That should give enough feats to get WF and WS in both shortsword and shortbow by then.<br/>\n<br/>\n The predecessor of the rogue class was the 1st and 2nd edition thief class. Mazzy is not a thief, and Arvoreen does not have much sympathy for Brandobaris and his unreliable mob. But he\u00a0accepts rogues that fight and defend halfling lands. Even so the rogue class is different from the old thief class. You dont have to be a criminal, unreliable or antisocial\u00a0in any way if you are a rogue. Rogues can even have a lawful alignment. They have an enormous selection of class skills, but do not have to choose skills like pick pocket, bluff\u00a0and open lock. When we suggest rogue as part of Mazzy's build,\u00a0is it only\u00a0to bolster her combat prowess and make her a more reliable fighter.<br/>\n Rogue is a staple class for halflings, and comes with their free spirit.<br/>\n The rogue weapon proficiency gives access to both shortsword and shortbow, exactly Mazzy's wepons. The only thing the rogue class doesn't give her is shield proficiency.<br/>\n The rogue class is more open than the thief class and gives room for much more diverse and less stereotypical\u00a0roleplay.<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The only sage words I've decided against are those starting her off as a Rogue - I think I'd rather have the Fighter's bonus feats early on than the extra 2 skill points. Once again, I find working out the where and when of skills allocation a hard slog - ditto saves - so I'll present as I did yesterday for the moment. Hope you don't mind. (I do know I'm maxing Discipline, Tumble, Spot and Spellcraft - can't remember for the nonce whether that features in a Rogue's class skills or whether I'll have to run it through as a cross-skill. If I've got any spare, one - or some of several - of Persuade, Heal, UMD and Lore appeal.)<br/>\n<br/>\n Before beginning, I know I'll need some help with AB and AC before finalising the build, so apologies in advance.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">First of all, congrats for your first real build Stagmeister!<br/>\n<br/>\n And although i would prefer if you have made a dual-class version of Mazzy first (FTR 30/ COT 10) so we could make the transition to the full build easier for you, you seized the initiative and delivered a good combo by yourself. As Mick said previously, it's far from being a bad build and what's more your class split seems good enough. Alriight, now let's begin with the \"refinement\" of your build, aye?<br/>\n<br/>\n a) First thing, we need to do is to make sure the build is legal 1.69 in Neverwinter Nights, so you will have to replace/change the \"Great Dexterity\" feats from the bonus epic feats a Fighter can take. Similarly, in your first version of Mazzy, you cannot take \"Great Strength\" as a bonus epic Fighter feat, in fact \"Great Strength\" can only be taken in epic general feat levels (21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39) as no class has it in it's bonus feat list. You might also want to change \"Toughness\" from your 16th level slot, and put it on a general feat level (1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18) as it is no CoT bonus feat (or any class for that matter). You can change positions with \"Great Cleave\" if you want.<br/>\n<br/>\n b) Something very useful to know, is that you can take EWS in any weapon that you have already WS, in any CoT bonus feat level. Alone CoT cannot take even the simple WS but once he has it form the Fighter, he can take the Epic version just fine with his own bonus feats.<br/>\n<br/>\n c) Your HP's are correct. Mazzy has exactly 464 HP's, a little anemic, eh but we will see what we can do later for that. Don't forget that she has...<br/>\n<br/>\n d) Epic Dodge! That is a very, very nice feat to have! You could take it a bit earlier if you tried enough but we will fix thaat earlier, no big deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n e) Your skill points are correct likewise, Mazzy has exactly 256 skill points, but do not forget that you must tell people where to put all those lovely skill points eh? Or else people will put them to \"Lore\" cause they don't like to go back to store to identify their items ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n f) An easy way to calculate the AB of your character is to look what <strong>B</strong>ase <strong>A</strong>ttack <strong>B</strong>onus (BAB), they have at the first 20 levels of their life. Mazzy has all full BAB classes except four levels of Rogue (3/4 BAB) pre-epic. Those (3/4 BAB) classes work in clusters of\u00a0 \"Four\", as Mick explained before. As long as you have only four levels pre-epic then you lose only (1 BAB) which is a small price to pay for the early playability Rogue brings to the table. So, keeping that in mind we have 19 BAB pre-epic aand then epic is\u00a0 all the same for everyone. All classes gain +10 BAB more from the 20 epic levels. Thus Mazzy has 19+10= 29 BAB. Write that down to the BAB section of your paper, then let's do the AB math.<br/>\n<br/>\n Total AB= BAB +(WF, EWF, EP) +(Attribute Modifier) =&gt; MAzzy's AB= 29 +4 +11 (If your Dexterity is correct, i will assume it is for now) =&gt; 44 AB. Again, you calculated correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\n g) Your AC is 10 (Base) +2 (Armour Skin) +8 (Full Tumble Ranks) +11 (Dexterity Modifier) +2 (Large Shield, Halflings cannot use a Tower Shield) +1 (Halfling Size Bonus) =&gt; Mazzy's AC is<strong> 34</strong>, (Carefull, this is without Plate mail, as it will interfere with your Dexterity bonus, thus <strong>Lowering your total AC</strong>!)<br/>\n<br/>\n h) Calculating your Saving Throws is easy as well (well, easy when you have done it before). For this you will need to consult the Wiki and look at what the individual bonuses are before epic, then add them together. Here, let's do that together for this time.<br/>\n<br/>\n 8 Lvl's of Fighter: 6/2/2 (Fort/Ref/Will)<br/>\n 8 Lvl's of CoT: 6/6/2 (Fort/Ref/Will)<br/>\n 4 Lvl's of Rogue: 1/4/1 (Fort/Ref/Will)<br/>\n -------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n (Ftr 8/ CoT 8/ RoG 4): 13/ 12/ 5 (Fort/Ref/Will) --&gt; That's up to Lvl 20.<br/>\n -------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n +10 To all Saving Throws: 23/ 22/ 15 (Fort/Ref/Will) --&gt; That's for the 20 Epic Lvl's.<br/>\n -------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n +2 Fort (CON)/ +11 Ref (DEX) -1 (Will): 25/ 33/ 14 (Fort/Ref/Will) --&gt; That's for your Attributes.<br/>\n -------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n +1 To all your Saving Throws for being a Hin. 26/ 34/ 15 (Fort/Ref/Will) --&gt; Hin's have the \"Lucky\" Trait.<br/>\n -------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n +2 (Will): 26/ 34/ 17 (Fort/Ref/Will) --&gt; That's for your feat \"Iron Will\"<br/>\n -------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n +5 To all your Saving Throws: 31/ 39/ 22 (Fort/Ref/Will) --&gt; That's for having 10 Lvl's of COT.<br/>\n -------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n Total: Fort +<strong>31</strong>/ Ref +<strong>39</strong>/ Will +<strong>22</strong>, And those are your saves, before we add Spellcraft Bonuses (Typically another universal +4).<br/>\n<br/>\n See, once you add correctly the first 20 levels, it is only a matter of adding your attributes and racial bonuses, it's simple math afterwards (and memory so you don't forget anything).<br/>\n Quite good Saving Throws, if i might say. It is no coincidence that (Ftr/ Rog/ CoT) is consider to be one of the most versatile, all-around best combinations!<br/>\n<br/>\n And here i will have to stop because those are already enough for now and i do not want to confuse you with additional input. One at a time and you will be fine, remember to do baby-steps in the beginning.<br/>\n For now, try to correct your feats so that your build will be legal and try to put a rough guide as to where you intend for Mazzy to spend her skill-points.<br/>\n<br/>\n Keep-up the good work,<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

When they are getting better and better? You must be joking...<br/>\n<br/>\n Now you're getting really close!<br/>\n The only thing that won't work at all is taking epic dodge at a fighter bonus feat (lvl 33). An easy way to fix it is to take great dex at level 24 and ewf shortbow and epic dodge at level 33. Great dex must be taken as a general feat with these classes. Epic dodge can be taken at a rogue bonus feat, but you don't have any more left, so you must use a general feat. Ewf can be taken at a fighter bonus feat.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for skills:<br/>\n The way you take discipline, maxing every time is how I do it too.<br/>\n You do the same with spot, and that is fine as well.<br/>\n You take spellcraft for the bonus to saves vs spells. With intelligence 14 you get a +2 bonus to spellcraft. You get +1 to the saves for every 5 <strong>modified</strong> ranks. So with 3 ranks plus the intelligence bonus your modified rank is 5 and you get +1 to saves vs spells. With 8 ranks your modified rank is 10 granting a +2 bonus to the saves etc. The max you can achieve alone when you cross class spellcraft is a +4 bonus to saves from 20 modified ranks with 18 ranks invested.\u00a0 If you take 21 ranks like you do, you reach 23 modified ranks. You can still reach 25 for a +5 bonus if you raise intelligence by 4 (items/fox's) or wear items with a skill bonus.<br/>\n The AC bonus you get from tumble is based on the ranks you take, <strong>not</strong> the modified ranks. If you take 5 ranks, you get a +1 AC bonus, if you take 10 you get +2 AC etc. With a class like rogue that has tumble as class skill, you can have 5 ranks at level 2, 10 ranks at level 7, 15 ranks at level 12, 20 ranks at level 17 etc. So if you take rogue at these levels you can max the tumble AC as early as possible. You should stop at 40 ranks, like you do. There is no reason to take it any further.<br/>\n As for your remaining skillpoints there are several options. Empyre65 gives good advice when he points at UMD and search. \"Gain entrance\" (the police version of open lock <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /> ) is also available.<br/>\n<br/>\n Try to find a way to adjust your build to fit in what I have explained.<br/>\n Then it is time for her eyeliner, rouge, nailpolish, and gloss.<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks again, Mick. The Epic Dodge thing was me missing that I'd taken it as a bonus feat, not on purpose. I will correct it as you suggest. And I noticed that I'd taken Weapon Spec as a general feat at level 6 as well (same problem), which I'll also correct, but more easily given that my new level 6 won't have both a general and a bonus feat. You'll see at the reveal.<br/>\n<br/>\n I just have one question - although it is many-pronged - about the skill points, which might blow version 4 of Mazzy clean out of the water. If I can take 5 points of Tumble at level 2, does that hold true for Spot, Search and UMD as class-skills for Rogue? The underpinning question being: is it still ok for me to take Fighter at L1, then Rogue at L2, and still have this apply, or do I need Rogue at L1 as well? (The latter would knacker the build from level 1 for me, 'cause I'd miss the bonus feat there and couldn't make it up elsewhere.) If I <em>can</em> do Fighter at L1 and Rogue at L2 and attract those 'extra' 3 points for each of the skills, can I then hold them over for my final 'skills dump' at level 37? That might not be the most stylish way to use them, but I'm doing it all on paper, and my brain's beginning to bleed with all the maths!<br/>\n<br/>\n There doesn't seem to be much to gain by posting version 4 until I know, so I'll hang fire for now.<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and I appreciate the elegance in your latest suggestions - in that, in Epic, there's now no more than 2 levels (and that only once) between keeping my Dex scores in even numbers. Very nice move!<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Valerfor - sorry, didn't see your reply before making my own (v slow typist, I guess). Thank you - it's good to be a first! Of course, the alternate view is that nobody's done it before 'cause it's daft ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n But credit (or blame) where it's due - Mick started all the Baldur's builds with Minsc (who seems to me the very chap to take through Adam Miller's saga), and you were the one to request a Mazzy and poke me with a pencil until I did something about it - and that's all aside from the two of your invaluable information, advice and guidance.

At any levelup you can spend what skillpoints you have gained at that level and the ones you have saved from earlier. You decide how many of the available skillpoints you want to spend.<br/>\n For class skills you can reach (characterlevel +3) ranks. At character creation (lvl 1) you can have 4 ranks in a class skill, at level 2 you can have 5 ranks etc.<br/>\n The different classes have different sets of class skills, and that does have impact on when you want to take the classes in a multiclass-build. It becomes important to know your classes and what class skills they have.<br/>\n<br/>\n Discipline is a class skill for fighter and CoT. You want to top discipline at fighter and CoT levels.<br/>\n Spot is a class skill for CoT and rogue, and you want to put points in spot at rogue and CoT levels.<br/>\n Spellcraft is a cross class skill for all your classes, so it doesn't matter what class you take when you put ranks in that skill. You spend 2 skillpoints for each cross class rank, and can have 2 ranks at level 1, 3 ranks at level 3, 4 ranks at level 5 etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n Tumble is a class skill for rogue and you want to put points in tumble at rogue levels. If you take rogue at level 2, you can have 5 ranks in tumble, no matter what you took at level 1. Since tumble gives +1 AC every 5 ranks, it is popular to take rogue at level 2, 7, 12, 17 etc. to be able to get 5, 10, 15, 20 etc ranks as soon as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n UMD is a class skill for rogue and it cannot be cross-classed. UMD let you use class- race- and alignment-restricted items that you normally don't have access to. What items you can use improves with every 5 <strong>modified</strong> UMD ranks you get. UMD is modified by charisma, and your modifier is -1 since your charisma is only 8. Your build will need 6 ranks im UMD to get a modified rank of 5, and 11 ranks to get a modified rank of 10 etc. You will be able to get 6 ranks at level 3 and 11 ranks at level 8 if you take rogue at those levels. So if you want to get a high UMD as soon as possible, you take rogue at level 3, 8, 13, 18 etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n I have given you reasons to take rogue at level1 and level 2, 7, 12, 17 etc, but also level 3, 8, 13, 18 etc. I have also told you why you don't want more than 4 rogue levels pre epic. That means that you have to make some choices and decide what you think is most important: Rogue at level 1 for max skillpoints, at level 2, 7, 12, 17 etc to max tumble AC asap or at level 3, 8, 13, 18 to max UMD asap.<br/>\n Many of my builds have rogue at level 1, 7, 12, 17 etc, but sometimes I go 1, 8, 13, 18 etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, I have to stress that skill management is not everything, feats are also important. You have chosen a series of rogue levels during early epic levels to be able to get epic dodge at level 33. Your last rogue level should come at levl 37 or later depending on when you want your last rogue skill-dump.<br/>\n<br/>\n I hope this helps answering your question(s).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I am not talking about miss Mazzy here, as this is posted in a thread that was calling for \"thematic\" builds, and that's fine, but for the lvl 40's section, you have to make her as deadly as you can. The one thing i see here is 7d6 sneaks that will go to waste if you don't take knockdown or use darkness/flanking a lot, and that's a waste of good material if you know what i mean. So, as a powerbuild suggestion, i would say trade two feats from the power attack line and take improved knockdown since you have all the pre-requisites for it, so your character will be able to operate in her full potencial.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

She IS optimized according to the concept (a dual caster with both arcane and divine spells). If you mean having all 9 Cleric spell levels, you'd need to drop an Epic spell for a spell level that only gives you save-oriented spells. Also, you'd need to mess with the stats, lowering the saves.

Mind you, when it comes to equipment though, things might change. Say you equip a pair of gloves of Epic Discipline (+30) and you have no ranks at all, what good that will do? Now try this again with full ranks like she has, see the difference?<br/>\n For example a modified (75+) Discipline score wiill protect you from anything that might harm you, you don't want your weapons to drop on the ground suddenly, right? I can give you many examples like this but the gist of it is that it's far better to have it than not.<br/>\n<br/>\n Q) Her AB is too low, can she hit anything or i should be using Spells instead? And how i am supposed to affect her enemies with only 23 CL?<br/>\n<br/>\n A) Her AB is fine, more than fine actually because she can buff it to mid-fifties easily and multiple times a day. If there wasn't a Cap to AB enchantments she could easily get more than that. A mid-fifties AB is very good\u00a0 for even medium magic PW's and virtually any module<br/>\n that you might want to play. If you need even more AB she can Taunt her opponents with good chances to succeed and get to +61 AB max. Her AB buffed is the equivalent of a strong fighter that is equiped with mid-magic gear, so she should be able to hit pretty much anything.<br/>\n As for the spell part, you might have some problems with affecting some resistant to spells enemies. You should use Mordenkainen's Disjunction before your other spells in order to lower their resistances first and dispel their buffs.<br/>\n<br/>\n Q) Why do you recommend these Domains instead of others? Why not TRAVEL/ TRICKERY instead?<br/>\n<br/>\n A) These Domains have natural synergy for her build. WAR Domain is a \"must have\" and STRENGTH Domain give her additional DP slots at Lvl 3. Both Domains have useful special powers in addition to the spells and are depending on charisma for their duration.<br/>\n This build has no need for TRAVEL/ TRICKERY Domains because her Sorcerer bufs take care of these spells and your Pixie Familiar for all your Rogue needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n Q) Where would you recommend she is suitable for playing her and where she is not?<br/>\n<br/>\n A) That depends pretty much upon your PW and it's magic Lvl. Up and including mid-magic PW's (+5/+6 Items) she is very powerful. If you play on a high-magic PW then she starts to decline.<br/>\n For modules however, she should be overwhelmingly powerful for all of them, no-matter their magic Lvl.<br/>\n<br/>\n Q) Do you have a recommended spell-list for her Sorcerer/Cleric spells?<br/>\n<br/>\n A) Yes i do, just ask for it and you will have it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

For the rest of your points,<br/>\n<br/>\n a) Her maximum load is 116 lbs. Vs 99 current load with full equipment. So, this is just wrong, maybe you are confused with other builds that have only 13 strength (just for taking PA) instead of 14 like she has here.<br/>\n<br/>\n b) Again wrong, how did i not gained any AB when i am taking WF/ EWF/ EP? That's four (4) AB that she didn't previously have. And i am not even including her Taunt skill here which buffed is a 55 +1d20 check and can gain her 6 more AB not included in the Cap. And no, you couldn't gain more AB than i gain here, except if you went for Zen Archery and this is sub-par to a good Scimitar &amp; Shield combo.<br/>\n<br/>\n c) I did not lost 6 charisma, the two points were transfered to constitution in order for her to gain +80hp's and +2Fort, and the rest of them were used to gain Auto Still III. There are no \"wasted\" points anywhere in the build.<br/>\n<br/>\n d) And you are wrong as well, in your assumption that i made her as an alternative version of your Aerie from BG2. I explicitly stated that i wanted a full-powered build using these three classes (Cleric/Paladin/Sorcerer) exactly because there is no previous builds with them and i saw it as a good combo that we might have missed. I am searching like that all of the time, this is how (between other) we invent new builds anyway. Your build of Aerie as a spell-caster from BG2 was very good, i said that already.<br/>\n<br/>\n And i will throw down the glove as well, DO try and come-up with something strong, i am enjoying this ;-)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The main reason here is that because of 23 BAB, Divine Power will add 7 to her AB, instead of 5. That means that you have a couple of extra points to juggle with back and forth. 7 DP, 4 DF, 1 Bless, 1 Prayer, 2 Battletide, 5 GMW (undispellable from Sorcerer spellbook) = 20 as well. So basically, I lost 0 AB, became more dispellable on the cleric side (with fewer spells as well), but Cleric mostly has good SHORT-duration spells, so what if she gets dispelled? Her premonition, damage shields, Flame Weapon, etc... don't go away. The Cleric spells she just rebuffs! And with this setup, she can alternate between Tenser's and Cleric spells (or both) without losing much AC thanks to EMA (none on WoG due to better implementation).<br/>\n<br/>\n I proudly present you, the MUCH IMPROVED Spellsword (hahaha just messing with you bro, but this is more powerful)<br/>\n<br/>\n Cleric(12), Sorcerer(26), Paladin(2), Human<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 14 (20)<br/>\n DEX: 8<br/>\n CON: 8<br/>\n WIS: 15 (16)<br/>\n INT: 14<br/>\n CHA: 16 (20)<br/>\n<br/>\n Human: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Cleric(1): Expertise, Power Attack, Domain Strength, Domain War<br/>\n 02: Cleric(2)<br/>\n 03: Cleric(3):\u00a0Extend Spell\u00a0<br/>\n 04: Cleric(4): STR+1, (STR=15)<br/>\n 05: Cleric(5)<br/>\n 06: Cleric(6):\u00a0Divine Shield<br/>\n 07: Cleric(7)<br/>\n 08: Cleric(8): STR+1, (STR=16)<br/>\n 09: Cleric(9): Divine\u00a0Might<br/>\n 10: Cleric(10)<br/>\n 11:\u00a0Cleric(11):<br/>\n 12: Cleric(12): WIS+1, Blind Fight, (WIS=16)<br/>\n 13: Sorcerer(1)<br/>\n 14: Sorcerer(2):\u00a0<br/>\n 15: Sorcerer(3): Still Spell<br/>\n 16: Sorcerer(4): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n 17: Sorcerer(5):<br/>\n 18: Paladin (1): Weapon Focus: Longsword<br/>\n 19: Sorcerer(6)<br/>\n 20: Sorcerer(7): CHA+1, (CHA=17)<br/>\n 21: Sorcerer(8): Armor Skin<br/>\n 22: Sorcerer(9)<br/>\n 23: Sorcerer(10)<br/>\n 24: Sorcerer(11): CHA+1, Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword, (CHA=18)<br/>\n 25: Sorcerer(12)<br/>\n 26: Sorcerer(13)<br/>\n 27: Sorcerer(14): Epic Prowess<br/>\n 28: Sorcerer(15): CHA+1, (CHA=19)<br/>\n 29: Sorcerer(16)<br/>\n 30: Sorcerer(17): Great Charisma I, (CHA=20)<br/>\n 31: Sorcerer(18)<br/>\n 32: Sorcerer(19): STR+1, (STR=18)<br/>\n 33: Sorcerer(20): Automatic Still Spell I<br/>\n 34: Sorcerer(21)<br/>\n 35: Sorcerer(22)<br/>\n 36: Sorcerer(23): STR+1, Automatic Still Spell II, Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor, (STR=19)<br/>\n 37: Sorcerer(24)<br/>\n 38: Sorcerer(25)<br/>\n 39: Sorcerer(26): Automatic Still Spell III, Epic Spell: Epic Warding<br/>\n 40: Paladin(2): STR+1, {Smite Evil}, (STR=20)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 180<br/>\n Skillpoints: 215<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 26/31/20<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8<br/>\n BAB: 23<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 32 (melee), 23 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 15/26<br/>\n Spell Casting: Cleric(6),Sorcerer(9)<br/>\n Alignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\n Concentration 43(42), Discipline 43(48), Heal 8(11), Spellcraft 38(40), Taunt 43(48), Tumble 20(19)<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Concentration(4), Spellcraft(4), Tumble(2), Save(8),<br/>\n 02: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(11),<br/>\n 03: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(12),<br/>\n 04: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(15),<br/>\n 05: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(16),<br/>\n 06: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(19),<br/>\n 07: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(20),<br/>\n 08: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(23),<br/>\n 09: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(24),<br/>\n 10: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(27),<br/>\n 11: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(28),<br/>\n 12: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(31),<br/>\n 13: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(32),<br/>\n 14: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(35),<br/>\n 15: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(36),<br/>\n 16: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(39),<br/>\n 17: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(40),<br/>\n 18: Concentration(1), Discipline(21), Heal(1), Taunt(21), Save(1),<br/>\n 19: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(2), Tumble(1),<br/>\n 20: Concentration(1), Heal(3), Spellcraft(1),<br/>\n 21: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1),<br/>\n 22: Concentration(1), Heal(2), Spellcraft(1), Save(1),<br/>\n 23: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(2),<br/>\n 24: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(5),<br/>\n 25: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(6),<br/>\n 26: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(9),<br/>\n 27: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(10),<br/>\n 28: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(13),<br/>\n 29: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(14),<br/>\n 30: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(17),<br/>\n 31: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(18),<br/>\n 32: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(21),<br/>\n 33: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(22),<br/>\n 34: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(25),<br/>\n 35: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(26),<br/>\n 36: Concentration(1), Save(30),<br/>\n 37: Concentration(1), Tumble(1), Save(32),<br/>\n 38: Concentration(1), Save(36),<br/>\n 39: Concentration(1), Save(40),<br/>\n 40: Concentration(1), Discipline(22), Taunt(22),<br/>\n<br/>\n So, what do you think?

Some gear swapping will certainly be in order! She doesn't even need Dodge boots to reach the cap, so she'll be fine. This gal will have\u00a0+20 Dodge AC (+5 from EMA, +11 from DS with Capped CHA and +4 from Haste spell or permahaste)\u00a0and she has Spell Mantles to deal with casters (maybe via bought scrolls but nonetheless, expensive but doable). In high AC builds I don't consider low HP to be a severe weakness at all, I enjoy the challenge.\u00a0She can handle herself pretty well even with the crappy HP. She has better saves than most, so those Greater Ruins she will no doubt get cast on her will be for half damage:D.<br/>\n<br/>\n Another tweak I just noticed is the Wisdom increase. It's in the wrong place. It can either be taken after you raise STR to 16 or before. Up to you if you want to have a few more spells per day or a higher base STR. I will go with the STR increase first then Wisdom at Cleric 12.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for taking them for a spin, show your ass around WoG and we might lol :D<br/>\n<br/>\n Take care brother!</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I want to take Aerie back to where she came from. She is an Avariel caster. When she joins your party the character sheet tells you that she is an elven\u00a0dual class cleric/mage, lawful good with the following abilities: Str 10,\u00a0 Dex\u00a017, Con\u00a09, Wis 16,\u00a0\u00a0 Int16,\u00a0 Cha 14.<br/>\n I have the following from \"The Forgotten Realms Wiki\":<br/>\n<em>Aerie was a female avariel, a race of winged elves, who was crippled by her wings being cut off, forcing her to remain earthbound for the rest of her life.<br/>\n Aerie's earliest life was spent apparently happily in Faenya-Dail, one of the few remaining cities of her people. However, she was captured by slavers (apparently still at a young age) when she swooped down from flight to rescue a child fleeing from them. They sold her to a circus, where she was kept on display and in a cage so small she had no room to stand, much less stretch her wings, which eventually became diseased. The infection threatened her life, which was saved in a very crude manner by painfully chopping off the wings.<br/>\n The circus had no more use for her after this, but the gnome called Quayle continued to take care of her as he had during her captivity\u2014though he could do nothing to restore her wings. The pair of them continued traveling with a circus that may not have been the same one, until it arrived in Athkatla and set up a circus tent in Waukeen's Promenade. While they were there, their disgruntled illusionist Kalah used powers of unknown origin to turn the inside of the tent into a world of deadly illusions, turning Aerie into the likeness of an ogre and chaining her magically to prevent her from escaping.<br/>\n It was at this point that Gorion's Ward and his party arrived at the Promenade, and met her.<br/>\n Aerie came across as very naive, caring and needy at the same time. She was a cleric as well as mage, learning from Quayle to serve the gnomish god Baervan Wildwanderer; she no longer felt quite worthy of approaching her old winged goddess Aerdrie Faenya. Her wingless state left her feeling generally unworthy and useless, which she gradually got over.<br/>\n Besides this preoccupation with her own problems, she was very empathetic to anyone else's plight and always eager to help.</em><br/>\n<br/>\n I have built her as a illusionist wizard with cleric as minor class (for theme and RP). Cleric offers armor proficiency and\u00a0minor spells. If you are hard core, you can take strength domain and extend DP. The single\u00a0monk level is pure (cheat)\u00a0cheese. I had skilpoints in abundance and cross classed tumble at level 7, 17 and 27 for playability even though there is a full class skill dump at level 40.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span

Was it the one where you take one class and then go to the other and can't level on the previous class anymore, or was it the one that you level both simultaneously? (like Jaheira was a Fighter / Druid and levelled on both class). Regardless, she was a Cleric/Mage, not a mage with some sprinkles of Cleric. I know you're more of a Mage dude and not much of a Cleric fan, which can be seen in your build. I like it, it's a very effective caster, but TBH, it's just a mage. Cleric in there is just to say that you have Clericlevels (it does literally nothing). I'm all for making her a Wizard, investing in INT and taking many levels in the class, but I wouldn't neglect the Cleric side as much as u have here. I'd go for a spread of 26/12/2 with a few less INT (you lose 2 Bonus Feats). You'd also need to get more WIS, which would lower your DEX for a bit. Good build, but IMO not very Aerie-like.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

No hard feelings. So you are picky as to what kind of CHEESE you will let into the build, huh? LOL. Kidding, but seriously, you have made her much less of a caster this way, at least on the divine side. The first level Cleric spells are ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY buffs. She has Searing Light and Flamestrike to cast and that's it! See, the good thing about Cleric is that you can be a melee-efficient toon, but you don't NEED TO. By selecting spells other than combat buffs, she can happily play the role of caster. And her damage spells start coming from 4th level on. Flamestrike, Blade Barrier, Harm, Destruction, Fire Storm, SoV. However, all of those require high WIS. I keep coming back to that everyime I try to imagine her this way. The only way I see her being a dual-caster is reducing Wizard levels and increasing Cleric. Perhaps something like Cleric 17 Wizard 17 CoT 6 (for 3 Great Wisdoms) could also be Aerie-like. IDK. About her not being a spellsword, she isn't. I'm all with you, but I do see her as an Arcane / Divine dual-caster with Zen Archery and split stats. I agree with you that she needs to be a Wizard. I'll try to come up with an entirely different build taking into account your take on her but without neglecting the Cleric side..<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<br/>\n \u00a0</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Of course, you need to cast the spell and fail first to realize that the monster has SR (or know whom you're facing beforehand). Either case, you may fail a few times, but not more than once per enemy. Let's not forget the Scribe Scroll feat from Wizards, which indeed makes the build shine because you can have MULTIPLE INSTANCES of all useful spells, including Time Stop, Mord's, IGMS, Bigby 9, Summon Creature 9, pretty much only limited by gold or XP that you have available.<br/>\n<br/>\n I know the DC of Wizard spells is a joke, but at least they HAVE no-DC spells for you to use, which Clerics don't, hence the need for Wisdom which also has the side-effect of raising AB. If all else fails, Summon Creature 9 / Kite and run :D. As a dual-caster I never expected her to shine in both classes, but I like the result, especially considering her personality.<br/>\n<br/>\n Val? Any thoughts? You have been summoned!<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh! one more thing. You may be wondering why the 14 DEX and 12 CON choice. That is a WoGism. There is a certain suit of chainmail armor that drops from certain \"hot\" casters that has 0% spell failure. With that and this gal's Empowered Cat's Grace she can have 1 less AC than a Full Plate wearer and still be able to cast at will. And on WoG you can also find Bracers of Shielding which are good for dual-wielders and two-handers such as her,\u00a0in a very nasty place that she can solo with ease (in theory).<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

She doesn't have Epic Spells, I know, but she more than makes up for it in versatility. She will need to equip AC items, but that won't hinder her casting. She'll have to craft 70 Scrolls of Shadow Shield along with wands of all her main buffs as she is dispellable, and she will equip WISDOM, INT and DEX items some of which will be removed after buffing. +3 DEX is enough for her to cap her stat, so she will have AoV and Maxed Cat's for a total of 9 DEX enhancement on her own. She'll have a Periapt of Wisdom +5 and a Maxed Owl's with an Ioun Stone to cap her Wisdom and a Ring of Clear Thought and a Headband of Intellect to take care of INT.<br/>\n<br/>\n Can we agree on this build?<br/>\n<br/>\n EDIT: Removed Maximize Spell in exchange for SF: Evocation<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'm torn about that. I myself have considered doing that. I would drop Maximize Spell pre-epic in a heartbeat for SF: Evocation, but\u00a0the two GWs in epics give her more than spell DCs, they give AB, AC and spells per day. So you would be trading 3 to DCs in 1 school vs -1 to DCs in all others, -1 to AB, -1 to AC, - a couple of spells per day. TBH I don't know if that is worth it, if it is, it's certainly not by much! Can we agree on dropping Maximize Spell for SF: Evocation and gain 2 DC only pre-epic in exchange for a metamagic feat that is pretty much useless if u factor in gear? Clerics have no spells that are worth maximizing, wizards have IGMS but I would never max IGMS and relinquish even one Time Stop. On a Sorcerer I wouldn't drop it, as if you need another IGMS to finish killing something, it's nice to have options, but on a Wizard you need to pre-memorize, so it's close to useless.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'll tweak that into the build when I get home.

I never said I wanted Spell Focuses in Conjuration, I said that DROPPING WISDOMS would lower the DC of SoV and Destruction just because it is the casting stat, which was something I didn't want. Implosion already gets +3 to DC, so adding +1 at the cost of lowering the DCs of all other spells (which don't get that bonus but are equally or even more useful in some situations)\u00a0by 1 is not a good trade for me. Let alone when it also means dropping AB and AC by 1. I don't want SF and ESF in Conjuration, it's fine the way it is. WHAT I DON'T WANT IS TO DROP WISDOM, because 32 for a caster is already at the lower end of things. I'd rather keep the Wisdom and lose 1 Implosion DC with the loss of the ESF feat. It's 1 Implosion DC (HoTG\u00a0is a shit spell that you won't be using by the time you get the ESF feat)\u00a0and you're suggesting dropping 2 stat increases that influence her casting and combat! Nay nay sir. Our choice here is simple: we either KEEP CRAFT WAND or SWAP IT FOR GSF: EVOCATION. This is the choice that I can live with and you're the Craft Wand expert, so you can make this decision, but if you refuse to make it and keep insisting on dropping the wisdoms I will arbitrarily make it. See I want us to make this build together and post it as a mutual creation by the both of us when it's done. We need to be able to reach some common ground. Come on, man! CW or GSF? Which one do you prefer?<br/>\n<br/>\n We can, as you say, once we create a topic for the build,\u00a0post this wisdom-dropping\u00a0as a suggested tweak that is a matter of personal preference. Or we can even post both takes on the same topic (I wouldn't mind) and let people who want to play it choose. For me, that's where I draw the line. I think dropping the Wisdom is a choice that would gimp the build and I really don't want to do it. Not for Evocation, not for Conjuration, not even for Armor Skin and Epic Prowess either. I like the epic feats the way they are now.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n On a side note, Destruction deals Divine damage when it fails. It's the good guy's equivalent of Finger of Death (which she would never use). I can totally picture her screaming: Die, EVIL MONSTER and then tossing a Destruction spell at a monster.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<br/>\n \u00a0</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Ask anyone that you want i am sure many can confirm that. I have seen Lvl 30 monsters with less than 10 will save and the DC of a WIS 30 Hammer of the Gods with GSF: Evocation is 28 (34). Most monsters that are brutes, will simply not save against it and it is an AoE Will save spell that makes everyone dizzy for 1d6 rounds in addition to cause damage, it's almost as powerful as stonehold. If you have use it and tell me that is \"shitty\" then our experiences simply are different, cause i can tell you from personal experience that this is a very good spell to have. It is in fact so good that even from a Wand with it's pathetic DC can cause a lot of damage to your enemies of up to say 20th Lvl of play. For latter you will need to cast it from your spell slots of course, in order to keep a good DC.<br/>\n<br/>\n c) We have very different opinions on to what is a relative good DC for spells and what is the lower-end on many things. A Caster can have a maximum of 38 in his main stat. I consider everything from 30 and onwards to be relatively good while you on the other hand, think thast only the maximum value or close to that is viable. Well, let me tell you that if you pick your spells &amp; focusses correctly your enemies will die by the score with \"just\" 42 in your main stat (which is base 30 plus 12 enchantments), i know because i am doing it all the time with Sorceresses that \"only\" have 42 Cha. With my Clerics, that is even easier because of their \"boosted\" Implosion DC.<br/>\n<br/>\n d) You were telling half the truth when you said that my suggestions would boost your DC's by 1 only and cause all your other spells DC's worsen by 1. What my suggestions would do is to rise your Evocation DC's by a net (3) and another School's DC's by a net (3). A Caster needs to specialize in his/her schools that he/she uses in order to be most effective. But it's fine man, either way this is your interpretation and you are free to make her the way you like, you wanted that one more point of AC/ AB so hard, that you won't listen to my suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\n It's still a good build though, i like her to a certain degree for sure.<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Well, let me tell you that if you pick your spells &amp; focusses correctly your enemies will die by the score with \"just\" 42 in your main stat (which is base 30 plus 12 enchantments), i know because i am doing it all the time with Sorceresses that \"only\" have 42 Cha. With my Clerics, that is even easier because of their \"boosted\" Implosion DC.<br/>\n<br/>\n d) You were telling half the truth when you said that my suggestions would boost your DC's by 1 only and cause all your other spells DC's worsen by 1. What my suggestions would do is to rise your Evocation DC's by a net (3) and another School's DC's by a net (3). A Caster needs to specialize in his/her schools that he/she uses in order to be most effective. But it's fine man, either way this is your interpretation and you are free to make her the way you like, you wanted that one more point of AC/ AB so hard, that you won't listen to my suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\n It's still a good build though, i like her to a certain degree for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">\n Alright. Sorry for the caps. They're for emphasis only, not aggression, but if you feel offended I'll stop using\u00a0them (BTW I sent you an e-mail with caps, can't unsend so sorry for those too). Let me just tell you this: what I wanted to do was simply post this build as a three-person creation. You, me and Mick if we could all agree on one. Of course, if you play her you'll tweak her and probably if Mick plays her he will tweak her, but if we could agree on things it could be Aerie the Avariel by Max, Mick and Val. Now it'll just be mine with honorary mentions to you guys.<br/>\n<br/>\n I won't debate much further since it's pointless as it's obvious we won't come to an agreement, but I would like to rectify your misinterpretation of my comments. Quickly and hopefully painlessly.<br/>\n<br/>\n a) I never said that you suggested Craft Wand for her, my point was simply that I acknowledge that you have used the feat much more than I and I wanted your \"specialist\" opinion as to where it would rank compared to GSF: Evocation. That's all.<br/>\n<br/>\n b) HotG is a good spell for \"mob control\". I misexpressed myself, but you would only get ESF: Evocation in epics, and at least on WoG, there won't be many mobs with 10 will saves worth wasting it on. I'm really stingy when it comes to spells, if I'm not in any danger, I'll conserve them, so I would never use it, despite the usefulness, for those easy mobs. That's maybe where the difference is.<br/>\n<br/>\n c) I like to have at least 32 on my casting stat for all my caster build, the only exception being Sorcerers, ironically. Sorcerers don't get Bonus Feats and they don't have much of a choice to switch one spell for the other, so versatility (metamagic feats) becomes more important for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n d) I understand why you say this, but what you don't seem to understand is that I would take GSF pre-epic, so the two Great Wisdoms lost would only grant the difference of +1 DC for evocation spells and the continuity of Craft Wand (so the balance of your suggestion would not be +3 for all Evocation spells, it would be +1 to Evocation spells + Craft Wand x -1 AB, -1 AC, -1 DCs to all other spells), since GSF is not an Epic Feat.<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, this is a stupid reason to fight anyway. Relax bro, it's all good.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

nothing I could do to change that without de-Jaheirizing Jaheira :D, and she never shifted to fight, so I didn't want to go for Dragon Shape and make her Wisdom-based. So she's basically a low-AB spellsword, not too different from a mage one, except she can't stop time or do any of the cool things that mages do... I could make her a Zen Archer DC caster, but IIRC she didn't cast much in BG either...<br/>\n<br/>\n What do you think? As a concept build, do you see any changes that could be made to her to make her stronger without using polimorphs?<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I could've made him a Fighter 16 WM 19 HS 5, I could've taken IKD, I could've probably raised his AB as well, but I wanted the average joe feel to him, so I kept him as such.

So here's where I'll do it. I'm already cross, because my first thought - given that Shar is the goddess of darkness and loss - was a stealthy Cleric 29/ Monk 9/ SD 2 (for HiPS - I wouldn't get the required DEX for ED, or I'd have gone Cleric 26, SD 5 instead) or a more in-your-face Cleric 26/ Monk 6/ CoT 8 (assuming the successful romance option of turning Vicky to True Neutral). But she's an elf, so we're destined for xp penalties regardless, damn it! I suppose, technically, I could make her a Cleric/ CoT/ SD, but that would require lots of cross-classing skill points in Hide, Move Silently and Tumble.<br/>\n<br/>\nViconia's BG2 stats are STR 10, DEX 19, CON 8, WIS 18, INT 16, CHA 14, and I'm working from a putative base of STR 12, DEX 16, CON 10, WIS 16, INT 14, CHA 8, with all pumps into WIS.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, before embarking on anything too stupid (and before I read Max's Guide), a couple of questions: is it worth biting on the xp penalty for either/both of my preferred splits? Admittedly, a case could be made for Assassin, but it's tough enough trying to work out my first Cleric, let alone adding in another build I've never...built. Second, does my thinking on the stats make some sense? There is a third question - in my long tradition of a \"couple\" meaning 3 - could someone explain \"domains\" to me, please?<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, but I did warn you!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Domains are extra powers that a Cleric has. Think of them as something additional to the normal Cleric powers. Each domain powers are different and a Cleric can select two of them. As an example, War Domain gives you the \"Battle Mastery\" ability that is usable once/ rest but also two new spells that normally Clerics do not have access to (cat's grace and aura of vitality). We usually select domains first and foremost for the additional spell choices that they add to the normal spell list. There are many wonderful things that domains can give to a standard cleric and a great way to customize them, Sun domain, for example, turns your Cleric into a bane for the undead and its powers are constant. You can see the different domain in the wiki, <br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Cleric_domains\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Cleric_domains</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the Exp penalties, I say, if you can avoid them, then do so. Building with human is a great way to do that and yes, in your fantasy Viconia can be a human, no problem at all. Case in point, \"my\" Viconia in BG II never was a spell-slinger only, in fact she was in the thick of battle wielding Crom Fayer (gives her Titan's strength) and equipped with the best full plate armour she could find. That would make her a Cleric/Fighter/CoS* in my case at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nCoS* stands for Champion of Shar.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last thing before we move forth (you must gather your party-oh, shadd-up!). Viconia can be a jealous mistress, are you sure she doesn't deserve her own thread? ;)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'll see what stats I can come up with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never used her as a front-liner, mostly preferring to give Minsc the Crom Faeyr, dual-wielded with that axe that \"lops off heads like nobody's business\", but I would give her some ogre-power gloves so she didn't collapse under the weight of a big shield.<br/>\n<br/>\nHmm. I won't pretend that Fighter appeals as a class, but the Cleric/ Monk/ CoT option still appeals (and, bearing in mind Max's instruction not to have a BAB of more than 15 pre-epic, the temptation is to go Cleric 15/ Monk 5 pre-epic, then Cleric 11/ Monk 1/ CoT 8 in epic levels - although I'm now quite tempted by dropping Cleric to 23, bumping CoT to 10 (for the saves and maintaining the bonus feat) and 1 more Monk level for another +1AC and additional skills dump. Wearing robes, obviously.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAllow me to mull...<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Sorry, you're right, she is of jealous disposition, so the next post I make will be as a new thread.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The main one is Fighter 28 Bard 2 RDD 10. You can use your thousands of feats to be proficient with both Halberds and Greatswords if you want. Pretty straightforward toon to make.

Drizzt was adventuring in the wilds for almost all of his life, he was a follower of\u00a0Mielikki and he taught directly from the great ranger Montollio (whose cloak we can find in BG II) . Thuss Drizzt, for me at least was a fighter and a ranger first &amp; foremost &amp; his time in the Underdark but also in the society of the drow warrants him to be part rogue as well. Well, the third can be debated but when I said earlier \"functionality before prestige\" I needed a way to make him (very) hard to hit &amp; there is no better way for that than ED.<br/>\n<br/>\nConcluding my thoughts we have his three classes, those are ranger/ fighter/ rogue. He is dexterity-based &amp; his weapons are kukris (the only finessable slashing weapon that does not impose a huge penalty on his AB). He has Bane of Enemies &amp; Epic weapon specialization to compensate for his lack of strength. Lastly, he has Epic Dodge &amp; high dexterity in order to make him (very) hard to hit by his numerous opponents. With his UMD he can operate a wand of darkness while he can cast UV on himself to represent his innate drow abilities. He has a (real) animal companion, a black panther named Guenhwyvar that can distract &amp; harass his enemies &amp; lastly he has the parry skill that gets augmented by his natural high dexterity. All of these work in harmony in order to give us one of the deadliest warriors in the fictional world.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis final build is (Ranger 23/ Fighter 4/ Rogue 13)<br/>\n<br/>\nStr: 14, Dex: 17, Con: 12, Int: 14, Wis: 12, Cha: 8<br/>\nStr: 14, Dex: 30, Con: 12, Int: 14, Wis: 12, Cha: 8 (final attributes)<br/>\n<br/>\nGR DEX III, EWF, EP, AS, WS, EWS, BoE, ED, FE VI<br/>\nExotic Weapons, Weapon Finesse, WF: Kukri, IC: Kukri, Blind-Fight, Expertise, Knockdown<br/>\n<br/>\nBAB:\u00a0\u00a0 30 (6 attacks w/ Dual-Wielding)<br/>\nAB:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 44/ 44/ 39/ 39/ 34/ 29 (Dual-Kukri)*<br/>\nDMG: 1d4+13 +2d6 +7d6 Sneak attack/ 15-20 x2 (Dual-Kukri)*<br/>\n<br/>\n*All of his stats assume that he is fighting against his 6 FE's<br/>\n**My only gripe is that I really wanted to push IKD in there but I couldn't, there are not enough feats for that sadly, him being a drow &amp; all that.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Quite apart from Mick's earlier, effectively, \"don't touch him with a barge-pole\", line - which I see as right. Sometimes, a one-off is just that, which is the whole point of them - particularly under different rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll get back to trying to build Viconia now - it's been a bit busy of late here, sorry. But I think I'll play a bit first - I'm only half-way through chapter 2 with the Savage Strike in the OC (level 11).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
