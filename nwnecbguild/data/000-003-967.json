      "content": "<div>You could go Cleric 12, the Bard 4, Rdd 4 pre epic, but since that would postpone the vital heal spell, I won't recommend it. Cleric16/bard14/RDD10 is a strong character. Cleric26/Bard4/RDD10can be considered, but you seem to want more bard. Bard song and curse song alone makes a huge difference in a party.<br/>\n<br/>\nSent fra min SM-G950F via Tapatalk<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>"

And, with high level undispellable cleric, bard song doesn't look that important IMO.<br/>\nJust take the 4th bard level after lvl 36 for UMD and Tumble dump!</div>"
