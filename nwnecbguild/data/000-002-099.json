      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">I am trying to understand how Monk UBAB and extra attacks work when shapeshifted, in particular in relation to the\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/order-of-jormungandr-1-69-t2355108.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Order of Jormungandr</a>\u00a0build.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuppose that I have a Druid/Monk/Cleric build, at level 40. In Dragon shape, my AB is 25 (base) + 19 (STR) + 6 (claws enhancement) -2 (size) +1 (EP) = 49.<br/>\nGiven Monk attack progression, I have 5 attacks/round, at 49/ 46/ 43/ 40/ 37 AB (assuming all are claw attacks).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow according to the\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Free_attack\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wiki</a>, free attacks for those who use creature weapons follow the normal attack progression, which is -3 per attack for a Monk. So assuming Divine Power (counting the extra attack but not yet the bonus AB), Flurry of Blows, and Haste, my attack progression should look like 47/ 44/ 41/ 38/ 35/ 32/ 29/ 26 (in practice in my case it looks like this +10, with DP adding 5 to AB and 10 to STR).<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing a Cleric, I can buff AB with Divine Favor (5) + Divine Power (5) + Battletide, Bless, Aid, Prayer (5), plus buff STR to cap for an extra 6 AB. Now, this hits the AB bonus cap on claw attacks, so in practice I end up with 67 AB on the first attack (and not 68). The schedule would be 67/ 64/ 61/ 58/ 55/ 52/ 49/ 46 using only claw attacks. Notice that the bite attacks happen at -5 AB when fully buffed instead of -6, and correctly so.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have tested this in the PGCC (I know the character sheet lies, I looked at the logs), and it seems to work the way I described so far, up to some possible difficulties distinguishing bite and claw attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, in the\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/order-of-jormungandr-1-69-t2355108.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">OoJ</a>\u00a0post* it seems that the claimed schedule is<br/>\n+66/ +66/ +66/ +63/ +60/ +57/ +54/ +68 (Fully Buffed in Dragon Shape &amp; Flurry of Blows)<br/>\n*Notice that the OoJ has 24 BAB, so claw attacks should indeed have 1 less AB than my character.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis seems to assume that some of the free attacks happen at max AB? I think I am missing something, what am I missing?<br/>\nThanks to the community, for everything!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Because I remember I tested this a long time ago, and the extra attacks didn't follow the Ubab progression when I tested it. How is that possible?
