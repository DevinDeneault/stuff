I left BAB at 15 for maximum DP goodness.<br/>\nConsider Travel if you cannot get Haste easily.<br/>\nConsider Trickery if you cannot get Invisibility easily or otherwise get the jump on mages.<br/>\nConsider War in every other case. Cat's grace is nice, but Aura of Vitality is fantastic in low-magic settings.<br/>\n<br/>\nCraft Wand for <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">your sex toy collection</span> many panthers and also everything else, since there are many level 1-4 cleric spells that are incredibly useful in a pinch but you don't want to waste slots on them normally. If panthers are very much affected by summon level, consider taking scribe scroll instead as a slower (to read out than to flick a wand) and more expensive but also more powerful option.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour reflex saves are terrible. Consider taking Lightning Reflexes instead of Called Shot, but you'll still fail every check ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nTumble and UMD come late, but it's something to look forward to.<br/>\n<br/>\n20% XP penalty for the very last level. You can take rogue at 20 to avoid it. You can take rogue as early as level 17 if XP is not a concern.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can swap your starting Dex and Con.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not a pro builder by any means, criticism and suggestions welcome.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">This is a tough RP build to get right. Much depends on interpretation. <br/>\nThere is no claw like weapon for player characters, unless you can polymorph into animal or beast/ monster shape. I read somewhere that Malarites are never without daggers. And maybe some axes may look a bit claw-like. Here I suggest Kukri with it's tusk-, horn- or claw like shape. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe AB is strength based and will benefit from Bull's and Divine power. Animal domain gives stronger summons and Cat's can buff summons as well as the character itself, which enables lighter armor, such as Hides or Scale mail. I have problems seeing this savage priest of beasts roleplayed in full plate and tower.<br/>\n<br/>\nMalarite clerics often multiclass with Babarian, Ranger or Druid. These classes all have some to offer, but IMO not enough to make it worth it. I prefer rogue and see nothing wrong with it RP wise. It has much to offer with class skills, evasion and UD.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 16/4 class split ends with level 8 spells. You may disagree and rather take a 2/18 or 3/17 split for level 9 spells. It costs 1 BAB and force you to increase wisdom. But clerics are extremely powerful and can live well with any of those splits.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is meant to be a RP build. I will ask you to see the build as a draft. I am not quite sure if I have found the best solution. It can be changed in many ways, depending on your RP preferences or a wish for more power.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Cleric(16), Rogue(4), Human\nSuggested alignment: Chaotic evil\nSTR: 14 (16)\nCON: 12\nINT: 14\n\n01: Rogue(1): Knockdown, Blind Fight\n03: Cleric(2): Weapon Proficiency Exotic\n05: Cleric(4)\n07: Rogue(2): {Evasion}\n09: Cleric(7): Weapon Focus: Kukri\n11: Cleric(9)\n13: Cleric(10)\n15: Cleric(12): Improved Critical: Kukri\n17: Cleric(14)\n19: Cleric(15)\n\nHitpoints: 172\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 12/15/11\nBAB: 15\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 16/26\nAlignment Changes: 0\nConcentration 23(24), Disable Trap 1(3), Hide 21(23), Move Silently 21(23), Open Lock 1(3), Search 10(12), Set Trap 1(3), Spellcraft 23(25), Spot 20(24), Tumble 20(22), UMD 16(15)\n\n02: Concentration(5), Spellcraft(3), Save(18), \n04: Concentration(1), Save(26), \n06: Concentration(1), Save(29), \n08: Concentration(2), Save(7), \n10: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5), Save(10), \n12: Hide(5), Move Silently(5), Spot(5), Tumble(5), UMD(5), \n14: Concentration(1), Save(7), \n16: Save(11), \n18: Hide(6), Move Silently(6), Spot(5), Tumble(5), UMD(5), \n20: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(5), </details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
