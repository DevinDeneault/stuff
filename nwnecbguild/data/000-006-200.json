      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Epic Dodge, EDRIII, undead immunities, 50% slashing/piercing resistance, DR 15/+3 and a nasty scythe are the marks of this build. Add epic trap skills, stealth, UMD, crippling strike, +13d6 sneak attacks and you get a nasty undead tank to deal with. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe build is evidently min-maxed to achieve this result and combat prowess is strongly dependant on party/umd buffs. Unshifted combat has to be of the ranged type, via meatshields/party members cover or kiting supported by stealth and traps (and umd of course). The Druid levels grant a useful animal companion for the early levels, extra AB in natural areas, immunity to grease/web/entangle, wild shape 1/day (it's gonna be useful early on), access to animal empathy (for extra help) and boni to stealth and saving throws vs fear. Shifter levels are squeezed in asap to support combat in different shapes and Rogue levels are spaced in order to always be the best trapper possible. Good saves (but Will) and high hitpoints further help out balancing the weaknesses of the build. Toughness can be changed for PBS (to help ranged combat from a close distance) or Weapon Finesse and EP for AS for higher defense. I chose to rely on shifted shapes for when combat needs the extra humph and to have a stronger attack (EP) given the many defensive fetures of the build.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>******************************</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;line-height:normal\"><strong>GRAVEYARD SHIFTER - DRUID(5),

For solo play especially I advice to get Finesse at lvl 3 instead of Toughness. Even with your animal companion (I suggest panther or dire wolf) and a dominated animal you'll end up having to melee and when that happens you want to have finesse. Traps are your friends, buy the cheap minor spike traps when you are scarce on resources they do their dirty job well enough. Entangle traps are great too. Kiting is one strategy you'll want to exploit and get your hands on some rods of frost or somesuch so that you'll always hit the mark. Try to get your sneaks in via flanking/ranged combat with meatshields keeping your enemy busy. Immunity to grease/entanglement/web is to be exploited as is the +2 AB in natural areas (which abound on WoG).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have started this build on WoG and I expect it to be lotsa fun.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
