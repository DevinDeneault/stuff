      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"><em>EDIT: January 2023. I've now played Lostara through to level 40 in the OC and Mines of Twin Summit, and was pleasantly surprised at the ease of levelling - especially for a build that certainly isn't min-maxed. She is definitely playable through every level, so I have no hesitation in recommending her to anyone who fancies a bit of RP.</em><br/>\n<br/>\nLostara Yil is a recurring character from Steven Erikson's \"Malazan Book of the Fallen\" saga. When we first meet her, she is a Captain in the Red Blades, a fanatical mercenary company in the service of the Malazan Empire. She is committed to the empire's cause, and a more than competent warrior. Eventually, she comes to realize the duplicity of her commander (with something of a doomed romance along the way), and becomes the ADC to the Adjunct - leader of the outlawed Bonehunters, once a loyal Malazan army but turned upon by their Empress. Later, it emerges that she was given to a temple of Shadow as a child, where she learned the Dance, only to see the temple and all its adherents destroyed, but not before having her interpretation of the shadow dance witnessed by the Rope, Patron God of Assassins. This becomes relevant later in the series, when the Rope possesses her to allow the expression of that dance in combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nLostara herself is definitely not an assassin (if we ignore her ranged murder of a particular individual early on and the later killing of her one-time commander). She is a warrior, highly trained, and a passionate adherent of a credo she believes to be right. So, to me that says Fighter and CoT. Then there's her childhood background in the art of Shadow, the skills of which are regained in later years. So Shadow Dancer.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I realize this build may be seen as back-to-front (lots of early Fighter and CoT levels), but there is little I can do about that, given the SD requirements. I also appreciate that it's far from optimized for power-game purposes. However, I'm trying to make a RP build here, so I wanted some strength as well as dexterity. She does still get ED, though (hence the SD 14, and yes, the last level is for a skills dump). I know she's supposed to have a longsword and a long-knife, but please grant me a little leeway. And she could do with some more skills, but something had to give.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhoo, see what you think. I know I enjoyed playing her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lostara Yil</strong><br/>\nFighter 12/ CoT 14/ SD 14<br/>\nHuman - any non-evil [<em>I went for LN</em>]<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Stats</strong><br/>\nSTR 16 (20)<br/>\nDEX 17 (30)<br/>\nCON 10<br/>\nWIS 8<br/>\nINT 13<br/>\nCHA 8<br/>\n<br/>\nHPs: 412<br/>\nAC: (naked) 30, (full plate) 29.
