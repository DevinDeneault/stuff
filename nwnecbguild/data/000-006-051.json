      "content": "<div>Two souls, The Judges<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is another of my \"<em>madness and disability</em>\" builds, this one has DID.<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/202301/10759307_759ac1147fbb34bb5ef9a182a2b98128.jpg\"/><em>Erkur and Tyrvodat, in the mind of Two Souls</em><br/>\n<br/>\nI apologize for my frenglish<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Backstory :</span><br/>\n<br/>\nErkur Briskshield is a strange and lonely Gnome. He lives alone in an ancestral forest ruled by Dragons and Giants. He's an hermit, an anachoret, dedicated to an old draconic God named Lendys, the god of harsh Justice. The draconic God has allowed him to embody his Justice since the little guy is one of the wisest and smartest creature of the Realms...<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring his childhood, Erkur was a very lonesome child, a smart weirdo, with strange habits, somewhere \"on the spectrum\". Other children bullied him, beat him, everyday during his childhood. The violence was also at his home, his parents were very harsh, violent.\u00a0<br/>\nTo cope, the soul of Erkur divided into two souls (in our world, we don't explain that by magic, we call this phenomenon Dissociative Identity Disorder), the first was still Erkur, the second one was a female dragon named Tyrvodat, traped in a little gnomish body.<br/>\n<br/>\nDuring their early adulthood, Two Souls were obsessed by draconic Lore, and they studied draconic secrets to help Tyrvodat to get a true Dragon body one day. They decided to embrace the Faith of Lendys, and to became\u00a0 living avatars of Justice in the Realms.\u00a0<br/>\nLater, the magical and the draconic knowledges of Two Souls became surnatural, and Tyrvodat gained the power to become a powerful green acid Dragon, enpowered with powerful damage shields and tough as an Immortal Judge.<br/>\n<br/>\nTwo souls now rules the Realms to punish the bad. He bait them as Erkur the little Gnome, a rich disabled Gnome who lose his mind, and then Tyrvodat appears and dissolve them while they're trying to beat him. When a good guy help The Judges, they offer a part of their wisdom and gold treasure to the benefactor.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Explanations :</span><br/>\n<br/>\nThis is I think a really more playable version of Spellfang, playable as a damage shield mage (damage shield, buffs, no save spells, wands, scrolls) until the draconic shape.<br/>\nIf you want to play a lazy and more playable damage shield build, more optimal, play Grizz's build Mestil's Half-Dead Juggernaut. Two souls is also a powerful build, but less playable (you can't cast except epic spells while in Dragon, you're not so tough in early levels), it's made for RP pleasure, but it's not just for RP, as every dragon build, if you're patient, you're rewarded.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter dragon shape, cast your buffs and damage shields and go dragon. You will crush every meleer. Your fort saves are high for dev criters.\u00a0 Against wizards, use you're no saves spells (IGMS), or try melee as a dragon (you're bad at it, but bad as a dragon, that's enough to kick a wizard).<br/>\nIf you have to recast your buffs and damage shield, cast Epic Warding as a Dragon, then unshape, cast your buffs etc., then reshape.<br/>\nStay Flat Footed against meleer, to loose 33 AC and always apply your damage shields.<br/>\n<br/>\nConcentration skill is about between 55 and 65 (buffed), so you're untauntable as a dragon, and very hard to taunt as a Gnome (concentration between 47 and 53).<br/>\n<br/>\nItems :\u00a0<br/>\nIn gnome form : constitution items. Before Dragon transformation : + constitution armor shield and helmet, + energy resistance (if you choose green dragon, choose other energy resistances than acid for exemple).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe build :<br/>\n<br/>\nGnome and Dragon, Loyal neutral (RP) ; True neutral (power gaming)<br/>\n<br/>\nIllusionist(25), Druid(5), Shifter(10)<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 6<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 14<br/>\nWIS: 18 (30)<br/>\nINT: 16 (20)<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\nGnome: (Defensive Training vs. Giants, Hardiness vs. Enchantments, Low-light Vision, Offensive Training vs. Goblinoids, Offensive Training vs. Reptilians, Skill Affinity: Concentration, Skill Affinity: Listen, Small Stature, Spell Focus: Illusion)<br/>\n01: Illusionist(1): Extend Spell, {Scribe Scroll}<br/>\n02: Illusionist(2)<br/>\n03: Illusionist(3): Toughness<br/>\n04: Illusionist(4): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br/>\n05: Illusionist(5): Empower Spell<br/>\n06: Illusionist(6): Craft Wand<br/>\n07: Illusionist(7)<br/>\n08: Illusionist(8): WIS+1, (WIS=20)<br/>\n09: Illusionist(9): Silent Spell<br/>\n10: Illusionist(10): Maximize Spell<br/>\n11: Illusionist(11)<br/>\n12: Illusionist(12): WIS+1, Spell Penetration, (WIS=21)<br/>\n13: Illusionist(13)<br/>\n14: Illusionist(14)<br/>\n15: Druid(1): Greater Spell Penetration<br/>\n16: Druid(2): WIS+1, (WIS=22)<br/>\n17: Druid(3)<br/>\n18: Druid(4): Alertness<br/>\n19: Druid(5)<br/>\n20: Shifter(1): WIS+1, (WIS=23)<br/>\n21: Illusionist(15): Great Wisdom I, Great Intelligence I, (WIS=24), (INT=17)<br/>\n22: Illusionist(16)<br/>\n23: Illusionist(17)<br/>\n24: Illusionist(18): WIS+1, Great Wisdom II, (WIS=26)<br/>\n25: Shifter(2)<br/>\n26: Shifter(3)<br/>\n27: Shifter(4): Great Wisdom III, (WIS=27)<br/>\n28: Shifter(5): WIS+1, (WIS=28)<br/>\n29: Shifter(6)<br/>\n30: Shifter(7): Great Wisdom IV, (WIS=29)<br/>\n31: Shifter(8)<br/>\n32: Shifter(9): WIS+1, (WIS=30)<br/>\n33: Shifter(10): Dragon Shape<br/>\n34: Illusionist(19)<br/>\n35: Illusionist(20): Great Intelligence II, (INT=18)<br/>\n36: Illusionist(21): INT+1, Epic Spell: Epic Warding, (INT=19)<br/>\n37: Illusionist(22)<br/>\n38: Illusionist(23): Epic Spell Penetration<br/>\n39: Illusionist(24): Epic Fortitude<br/>\n40: Illusionist(25): INT+1, (INT=20)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 340<br/>\nSkillpoints: 251<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 26/33/16<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9, Mind Effects: +2, Fear: +2<br/>\nBAB: 20<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 19 (melee), 20 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 10/17<br/>\nSpell Casting: Wizard(9),Druid(3)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nConcentration 43(47), Craft Weapon 9(14), Heal 33(43), Listen 36(54), Lore 43(48), Persuade 11(10), Spellcraft 40(45), Spot 36(52)\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>01: Concentration(4), Craft Weapon(4), Heal(4), Lore(4), Spellcraft(4),\u00a0\n03: Concentration(1), Craft Weapon(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1),\u00a0\n05: Concentration(1), Craft Weapon(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1),\u00a0\n07: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n09: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(3),\u00a0\n11: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n13: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(7),\u00a0\n15: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(11),\u00a0\n17: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(17),\u00a0\n19: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(24),\u00a0\n21: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(2), Save(3),\u00a0\n23: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(7),\u00a0\n25: Concentration(1), Listen(2), Spot(5), Save(8),\u00a0\n27: Concentration(1), Listen(3), Spot(1), Save(12),\u00a0\n29: Concentration(1), Listen(3), Spot(1), Save(16),\u00a0\n31: Concentration(1), Listen(3), Spot(1), Save(20),\u00a0\n33: Concentration(1), Listen(1), Persuade(11), Spot(1), Save(7),\u00a0\n35: Concentration(1), Lore(3), Spellcraft(1),\u00a0\n37: Concentration(1), Lore(4), Spellcraft(1),\u00a0\n39: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Save(7),\u00a0</details>\n<br/>\nDragon form :\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nHP : 800 (880 buffed with maximize endurance,920 with enpower endurance, without items /\u00a0 1040 if your able to cap the constitution with merging items)<br/>\nNatural DR : 40/+6 (you almost never need epic warding, keep it for moments where you can't adopt the form of the dragon).<br/>\nAB : 39 / 34 (with buffed strenght you can have a decent AB for trash mobs or fun but that's not the point of the build)<br/>\nAC : we don't care.<br/>\nSaves : fortitude 36<br/>\nReflex : 30<br/>\nWill : 33<br/>\nDraconic immunities.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nDamage shields duration : 50 rounds (your able to cast them 3 time before draconic transformation, that's enough to kill anybody).\u00a0<br/>\nEpic Warding : 1250 points, 25 rounds. Epic spells are castable in dragon shape.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPros : Draconic DR and HP (+1000 buffed) + Damages Shields are awesome. Pleasure to play a dragon entity with full wizard spellbook. Being a Gnome AND a Dragon is badass. Versatility, able to cast lot of spells and to create wands and scrolls.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nCons : a bit hard to play at low lewels, but not so hard if you know how to play a non pure wizard. No crit immune. Can't cast all the time, but not an issue if you know of to play this build with high spell durations.</div>"
