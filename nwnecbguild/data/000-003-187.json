      "content": "<div>Hi All,<br/>\n<br/>\n 'The time has come, the walrus said...' As many of you know, I've only ever played the OC, SoU and HotU before (no, sorry, I did Aribeth Redemption once) and, wanting to grow as a player, as well as assorted harangues from the big boys in the playground, I believe now's the time to try something different: so I thought, Aielund has been recommended plenty of times, let's try that. If I remember correctly, that can take me from L1 all the way to 40? And who knows, I might actually start seeing the benefits of Knockdown and its more butch brother!<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, given that it'll be very new for me, and the aforesaid wanting to improve as a player before I can really profess to be a genuine 'builder', I'm asking for help here, if you don't mind. I have in mind a Strength-based, Good or Neutral aligned Monk (obviously, for those who've read my previous ramblings) - preferably unarmed, but flexible on that, maybe with CoT (particularly for saves) or Fighter (Ranger if kamas), and either Rogue or Shadowdancer (still trying to improve my sneaking). I would intend to wear only robes and be human - although I could push it to Half-Orc if that would help with STR, although I appreciate that DEX and/or WIS would need to be quite high for AC.<br/>\n<br/>\n I don't know where it stands on the high-low magic index, nor whether Dev Crit works, so I'm floundering a bit - not just being lazy, I promise!<br/>\n<br/>\n Is this the sort of thing that might work in the Aielund environment - and, more importantly to me at least, can anyone provide me with a prototype, please?<br/>\n<br/>\n Still here, still annoying...<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks in advance, you lovely people!</div>",

You can bring henchmen along with you, so you don't have to rely on soloing everything, unless you want that extra challenge. In fact, going with a party adds a lot to the story.

      "content": "<div>Thanks Both,<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Empyre, splendid build, which I shall steal immediately - great AC, AB over 40, more than respectable saves - nothing dramatically weak, well-rounded starting stats - even I can see the advantages of DEX over WIS in a DEX build! Like you, I'm not a sneaker by inclination, but I'm trying to improve - hence my looking to Shadowdancer for HiPS (btw, am I limited to a given number of uses of HiPS in a daily cycle?), rather than going Rogue for UMD. I'll probably sacrifice some Heal and Lore for a boost to Move Silently and Hide, but I won't be maxing them. My only questions in the feats are: 1) Strong Soul - is that a bonus for resistances? Never used it before, so thought I ought to know. 2) I know lots of folk prefer Expertise over Mobility, is there a particular reason why you've gone the other way here? That's not a leading question - I quite like Mobility myself, it's just <em>there</em>, you don't have to turn it on. 3) Now, I'd always taken Power Attack as merely a step to other things, but I was talked around on that by others (predominantly Max, if memory serves), particularly for DEX builds. So, given that you've left it out, was I right all along?<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Mick, having just been Balduring, I realise how much I'd missed playing with others (oo-er), so companions (never liked the term 'henchmen') would be nice to have again. I always liked Linu and Deekin in the OC/SoU/HotU, but everyone seemed to make such crappy AI choices - 'there's one goblin - quick, fireball!' - that I decided to try soloing (that and I hate dropping and/or killing a companion I've emotionally invested in, blouse that I am). So, is the AI better in Aielund, or will I have to get used to the old 'shaking head and closing eyes in resigned fashion while preparing to reload' mode again?<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and looking through various recent-ish posts, Valerfor seems to have gone missing. Hope he's ok - does anyone know?<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers once again, comrades!</div>",

      "content": "<div>If you sneak around to avoid combat, you're missing out on the experience points you would have gotten for killing those enemies. The NWNWiki mentions nothing about limitations on HiPS usage, so unless it is something that the Aielund Saga limits that I don;t know about because I never tried it, you're fine there.<br/>\n Strong Soul gives +1 to Fortitude and Will saves, and saves against death magic. In the final battle, you need a good will save. On the other hand, by then you'll be immune to mental effects because of Monk 20, so it would be fine to drop that for Power Attack, which would help you bash locks. I might even try to think of something to replace Iron Will.<br/>\n Dodge and Mobility are requirements for Shadowdancer.<br/>\n The AI is better in the Aielund Saga, for example, both henchmen and enemies will use Taunt. You also have more dialog options on what instructions to give them. Still, don't expect geniuses.</div>",

Do this before loading new CC and after adding each successive one.\u00a0 As each new content compilation is added make a new text file with the new date in the name or some logical sequence notation if you happen to load more than one CC project in a single day.<br/>\n<br/>\n Then, if you ever notice the game is not running properly, crashing or creating corrupt files, by running a diff between the offending list and the previous one, you can easily identify which files did the damage.\u00a0 To resurrect proper functionality, then you can create temp folders and begin moving the candidate offenders one-by-one out of their respective custom folders until the game regains status quo.\u00a0 This is so much easier than doing a full reinstall, patching and scratching your head wondering what screwed up your NWN installation. This doesn't guarantee you'll find the intruder, but will narrow down the search significantly.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Apologies for the cryptic explanation, Stagmeister.\u00a0 I am also not tech-savvy, merely picking up bits of information as I read as much pertaining to NWN as time permits.<br/>\n<br/>\n Since your installation is causing problems (that is an understatement according to your description), should I be faced with the same issues and not able to determine the source of the trouble... I'd need to do a clean reinstall.\u00a0 For the first step, make sure you apply the Critical Rebuild of v1.69.\u00a0 I suspect you already know this but it never hurts to reinforce the fact one more time.\u00a0 Try playing a few minutes of the OC and each expansion to hit the ground running before trying community modifications.<br/>\n<br/>\n Then, just as a test, hunt around until you find another module that runs off of CEP 2.61.\u00a0 Try to find one that requires as few other custom resources as possible.\u00a0 It doesn't need to be anything special really.\u00a0 We want to confirm that the latest CEP package installed correctly. If the game runs smooth with one CEP module, it should run fine universally. Aeilund has quite a few additional customizations so I would be interested to find out, assuming there might be a repeat of the fatal issue the second time around, whether it was one of the Aielund-specific haks/overrides that cause the original malfunction.\u00a0 Baby steps is how a neurotic copes with the delusion of control.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Only then would I begin installing the full Aielund package.\u00a0 If the CEP-only content worked fine (essentially I mean the game starts normally, graphics seem normal, character movement is robust, etc... you know the drill), then applying the remainder of customizations should work fine.\u00a0 If not, try reinstalling just the Aielund package again.\u00a0 That's the best strategy IMO.\u00a0 At least installing piecemeal you'll learn more about the possible source of corruption should it fail again.<br/>\n<br/>\n I can sympathize with your frustrations.\u00a0 The problem arises because when content designers test their CC for release, they are limited to only their own hardware/OS configurations to access whether it is installing and working as intended.\u00a0 The portion of the user community with different rigs are the beta testers which is why you'll see version upgrades uploaded occasionally that may address reoccurring issues.\u00a0 But it's not like they are concerned with lost sales like BioWare was, so support will never be as comprehensive as a programming staff would provide.\u00a0 There is detailed installation instructions specifically dedicated to Aielund linked on the Vault DL page.\u00a0 I espect you also are aware of this.\u00a0 It is well written and concise.<br/>\n<br/>\n Fact: There is still activity on the BSN NWN legacy game boards, most of which is focused on custom content and scripting... a venue that is probably the best place to resolve issues related to installing CC.\u00a0 They may even have documented common problems and FAQ for you there.\u00a0 It's always nice to have a viable alternate knowledge base.<br/>\n<br/>\n With all that said, I hope you stick with it.\u00a0 There is so much great SP content and PW experiences to enjoy for a game so inexpensive and timeless, it will always be the best bargain going.</div>"

If the problem is missing files, doing this should ensure that you have them. This would be in addition to doing what Hip suggested.<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">We must be on the same wavelength with regards to this, Empyre, because that's actually what I would have done... me being skeptical about versions of CEP higher than v2.3.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n I have zero experience dealing the newest CEP versions so didn't want to further muddle the procedure for Stagmeister.\u00a0 I've been operating under the assumption that when v2.4 was released, the many issues/complaints users had with it MUST have alerted the CEP team to its intrinsic limitations (like backward compatibility) which they surely addressed in the later/latest upgrades. Or perhaps my rose-colored glasses are blurring my view? :P<br/>\n<br/>\n Aielund originally used v2.3 (or even lower) when offered on the IGN Vault, didn't it?\u00a0 At least that's been my best recollection.\u00a0 You've played this series a lot, so what do you remember?<br/>\n<br/>\n It's possible that the latest Aielund-specific hak was released to take advantage of some new content of v2.61.\u00a0 It would handy to know how long v2.61 has been available if for no other reason than to get a sense of how long the beta period has been.\u00a0 I don't think it's been very long, probably only months.\u00a0 Thing is... a smaller community of users in today's climate means fewer reports coming into the team about issues needing to be addressed.\u00a0\u00a0 Another consequence of a dwindling player base. :(</div></div>"

Sorry, renowned facetiousness trickling out now <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/6.gif\"/>). However, does/would CEP2.3 still exist out there? I got my downloady advice from the aforementioned Ahti Lilura Aielund blog, which was very recent and took me direct to relevant NwN Vault files Maybe that'll teach me to stay on site!<br/>\n<br/>\n So, would the best route be for me to try a CEP2.3 download, followed by a piece-by-piece series of haks and all the other malarkey (bmus, ems, etc) until it breaks - sorry, works? I'm obviously feeling more positive today, so am prepared to give it a whirl. (It appears I'm more guinea pig than miniature giant space hamster.)<br/>\n<br/>\n ~Squeak!~</div>",

      "content": "<div>Yeah, that's what I (and apparently Empyre as well) would do in a similar situation. I've never had any problems with v2.3 whether SP or PW.\u00a0 I recommend doing a manual install.\u00a0 IMO that's the most bug-free method.\u00a0 Just decompress the 7z compression anywhere you like, then move the contents of each folder into the corresponding folder in your ../NeverwinterNights/NWN game folder.\u00a0 Don't recall anymore if I had to create any new folders, but if so, just name them exactly as they are in the 7z archive (it may be case-sensitive so make it exact).<br/>\n On the Vault, it's <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://148.251.86.81/sites/all/modules/pubdlcnt/pubdlcnt.php?file=http://148.251.86.81/sites/neverwintervault.org/files/project/206/files/cep_23_full_c.7z&amp;nid=206\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\n Keep us posted as to your progress, eh?<br/>\n<br/>\n edit: Ummm... I just realized they posted two different versions of v2.3 on the new Vault.\u00a0 One filename has the trailing _c and the other doesn't.\u00a0 Both are 7z compressions. What I recommend is the one WITHOUT the installer so if the link I provided uses the installer, DL the other one and drag the files around yourself.\u00a0 Apologies for being so foggy on the exactitudes but with so many versions available today it is hard to keep track without a roadmap.</div>"

      "content": "<div>A jolly huzzah to one and all!<br/>\n<br/>\n Have got Aielund up and running now. As it transpired, the core of the problem lay in my HotU load: there was a Temp folder with nothing in it, which I'd always just ignored before - I mean, why bother if it's just an empty folder? Ha! I actually read the Readme file, and that said it could be an issue, so bin it. I did, and the game loaded (yeah!)...but not Aielund (boo!). I got a 'missing required talk table' message. Now, even I in my numptytude reasoned that it was probably the tlk files, but I knew I'd loaded them - so, puzzled I was, puzzled! However, all it took - and I suppose it's obvious to those who've been around a bit - was for me to take the indivdual files from the tlk folder I'd installed as a folder (thereby creating a talk talk folder, I suppose, which the game didn't recognise, or maybe just didn't like 80s synth-based music...I digress) and drop them into the pre-existing tlk folder. Et voila! (or viola, if you like your chamber music) My L1 toon bestrides Aielund like a...wet bloke in a frock with a rucksack.<br/>\n<br/>\n And the moral of the story is...read Readme files, take baby steps when you haven't a clue what you're doing (after all, I only got the thing working at all because I thought I'd give it one more try, having binned the failed one, before taking all the sage advice above), and don't lose heart.<br/>\n<br/>\n Btw, Empyre and Hip, the CEP2.61 clearly works, so you might want to give it a whirl. And please don't think this has been an utter waste of your time and efforts on my behalf, because it really, really hasn't. As ever, I've learned a lot that will be invaluable in the future (thereby avoiding me asking the <em>same</em> dumb question: there will, of course, be others), as well as lifting my overall understanding of how the beast works. Hopefully it will be of use to others, too. So huge thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm sure I'll be pestering you again soon about the plot, why I'm dying all the time, etc, so apologies in advance. Looking forward to giving it a good go, though!<br/>\n<br/>\n Finally, just for fun, the game is now throwing me the same 'Neverwinter Nights has to close' message as before, but now after I hit Quit, which is nice!</div>",
