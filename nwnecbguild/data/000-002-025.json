      "content": "<div>Hi everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nJust trying to determine my gear goals on my wizard. I imagine its environment dependant. But if we think in standard gear that I can find in most modules. Here is what i was thinking, let me know if i\u2019m missing something.<br/>\n<br/>\nChest : Best robes I can find !<br/>\nHead: Hood of intellect or similar<br/>\nGloves: Concentration<br/>\nCloak: really not sure. Maybe the best cloak with + to saves that I can find ?<br/>\nBoots: Travelling, haste or immunity to knockdown if I get haste somewhere else.<br/>\nRings: probly one ring of wizardry and one with int ? Or more saves ?<br/>\nAmulet: probly switch between something with spellslots and something with immunities depending on what I\u2019m facing.<br/>\nBelt: fear/death magic immunity I imagine.<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019m sort of ignoring deflection AC items and Natural armor amulets because I figure I shouldnt really be tanking and I have some spells to cover those.<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I on the right track ?<br/>\n<br/>\nTy :)</div>"
