The saves are good, you have monk class features, And that's about it. <br/>\nIf you build for a high magic environment, you want to give the build features that won't come from items, such as Epic Dodge, SCV, \u00a0Divine Might and so on. Things that make you survive all spells, traps and a prolonged battle of 20s.<br/>\nIf you add too many item bonus features, any build becomes almost impossible to kill. Then the game loses all challenge and becomes pointless. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am curious as to how you have tested this build and if your playing experience is any different from what I have outlined above.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That is why I chose paladin, because Cast Spell: Divine Might still spends Turn Undead. And yes, I was imagining this build engaging in a battle of 20s and that is why attacks per round, rather than AB is prioritized.<br/>\n<br/>\nA build with epic dodge will not win against this build who has 10 APR. Sure he will miss the first attack each round, but he will still have more attacks, with more divine might damage. There is also a chance to kill the enemy with On Hit: Slay if they miss their saving throw.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo one gets more chances to roll a 20 and the other gets more chances to roll a 1 on a saving throw.<br/>\n<br/>\nCast Spell: Divine Might ignores SR.\u00a0<br/>\nOn hit: Slay ignores death magic immunity.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdmittedly, the point of this post is not only to show the build, but to show items that fits it like a glove.

Basically, it attempts to the answer the question of how strong can a player character get with level 40 gear. I\u2019d like to be educated as well if there\u2019s a more optimized build with DIY gear. Skill focus feats seem like a waste, but there are no better feats that aren\u2019t provided by items. There\u2019s even allowance for item skill bonuses, even if item level restrictions are enforced.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a setting where everyone has similar gear, the skills discipline, concentration and heal can still be very slightly useful in very rare instances. One still has to worry about disarm and taunt. The build obviously can fight unarmed, but prefers wielding dual kamas. Curse song + taunt may not reduce its 124 AC significantly, but in an unlikely moment that it is caught flat-footed in an asymmetrical battle with a horde of enemies, the AC penalty can make a difference.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Considered a monk with epic dodge vs one without, both with similar stats and gear, on a toe-to-toe battle. These are my rough calculations:<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>With epic dodge:</strong><br/>\n10 APR/20 *13(damage from divine might)= 6.5<br/>\n10 APR/20*608(damage from on hit: slay)= 304<br/>\nTotal: 310.5 damage<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Without epic dodge:</strong><br/>\n9 APR/20 *18(damage from divine might)= 8.1<br/>\n9 APR/20*608(damage from on hit: slay)= 273.6<br/>\nTotal: 281.7 damage<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fight gets even more one-sided when both exhaust all divine might attempts. I will have to change to build. Thank you for your feedback <em class=\"mention\">@Mick Dagger</em>\u00a0.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em class=\"mention\">@Mick Dagger</em>\u00a0, what do you mean by SCV?

It lasts 1 round per monk level. So unless you do a lot of fighting between rests, the self concealment feats are not necessary. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn high magic settings, weapon enhancements can become so massive that you don't need much extra from the build itself. If divine damage is available on weapons, DM may end up being less attractive.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is a good build in a high magic setting depends completely on what items are available and if there are custom rules and changes to the classes, feats and skills. It is also important if the build is made for PVM or PVP.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere at the ECB most builds are made for more or less mid magic settings and PVM. We are supposed to tell what setting the build is intended for when we post a build.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way I understand the build above, it is an attempt to explore what can be achieved by a build given a free choice of item properties up to a given total gp value.

I edited my first post to reflect changes in item properties.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn hit properties on an item will only work if physical damage is dealt. In my imagined world, divine might is the only viable offense. And almost any build with similar gear would be nearly unkillable. As an example, for a 100% probability that a build like this will be killed within a round, it would require at least 188 enemies attacking simultaneously. Therefore, this is really an attempt to show the limits of power that can be achieved by items, even with item level restrictions.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Then there's the bard song, which I admittedly overlooked. If the second build manages to max out his bard song, he would have an AC that is equivalent to the first build, but only more temporary. Curse song will rarely matter if he will face foes like the first build, which will still have more than enough AC even if affected by max curse song + taunt.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

In my original (edited) post, the build has +56 discipline from items. But yeah, the bard would still have more discipline with bard/curse song.

The strategy of both these two teams is to attack one member of the opposing group until it\u2019s dead. Item regeneration bonuses aren't significant if we then consider the decimal points in the chart to be whole numbers, so that the number of combatants is actually in a factor of 188. That is, in each round, there are no surviving participants with less than full HP remaining.

One is the ability to add it to physical attacks with Divine Might. The second is that it is seldom resisted and items with divine resistence or immunity are seldom findings in most modules that I know. This is of great practical value when playing normal modules.<br/>\nOn the other hand it is possible to craft items with Resist 50/- and/or 100% immunity to all 12 damage types in the toolset (acid, bludgeoning, cold, divine, electrical, fire, magical, negative energy, piercing, positive energy, slashing and sonic). I doubt the practical value of that fact, but in the given context, it is something to be aware of.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The priorities in order are: level 40 stats &gt; alignment changes &gt; multiclass penalty.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last build is similar to the previous two in that alignment shifts from lawful to non-lawful then back to lawful. However, the Pale-Disciple also has to shift from good to non-good.<br/>\n<br/>\nStarts as lawful good. Non-lawful at level 8. After level 20, may go towards lawful before reaching level 40. Non-good as early as after level 6 and not later than level 22. Final alignment is lawful neutral/evil.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
