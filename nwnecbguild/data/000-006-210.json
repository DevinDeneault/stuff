      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Alright, this is for the people (like myself) that want to play an archer that is different from the standard AA's combos. I don't claim that this is as powerful as a well -build AA, nothing is, but it will do the job handily if you show him some trust. Moreover he is probably an icon since form tales/ folklore we all know Rangers to be synonymous with the word \"Archer\" more than anything else. Anyway, a few words for the build, one of the strong points of this combo is that we have uncanny dodge, so he will keep his vast majority of AC even when caught flat-footed. Moreover his damage is good, really good in fact, since he stacks Bane Of Enemies with EWS from the Fighter class and with 9 FE's he is pretty much guaranteed to have his BoE bonus everywhere that matters. Ranger spells like freedom, cat's grace, protection from elements and ultravision are all nice and useful and his animal companion is a welcome addition to his arsenal of weapons. He has also evasion, can spot, disarm and set all deadly traps, open most locks/ gates, use almost anything through umd and be stealthy like a shadow. I played him till level 36, or so and he felt good. He didn't outperform my arcane archer but he certainly felt more fun to my eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/wNryQ3d.jpg\" /><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;line-height:normal\"><strong>CLASSIC ARCHER</strong></span><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:120%;line-height:normal\"><strong>(RANGER 32/ FTR 4/ ROG 4)</strong></span><br/>\n<br/>\n RACE: Elf<br/>\n ALIGNMENT: CG<br/>\n PLAYABILITY: PvM 1-40<br/>\n<br/>\n STARTING/ ENDING STATS:<br/>\n STR -\u00a0 10<br/>\n DEX -\u00a0 18 (34)<br/>\n CON - 12<br/>\n INT -\u00a0\u00a0 14<br/>\n WIS - 14<br/>\n CHA - 08<br/>\n<br/>\n Hit Points: 424<br/>\n<br/>\n Skill Points: 258<br/>\n<br/>\n Search: 16 (20)<br/>\n Set Traps: 5 (19)<br/>\n Disable Traps: 16 (20)<br/>\n Spellcraft: 18 (20) cc<br/>\n Open Locks: 3 (15)<br/>\n Move Silently: 38 (50)<br/>\n Listen: 36 (40) {47}<br/>\n Hide: 38 (50)<br/>\n Tumble: 40 (52)<br/>\n UMD: 31 (30)<br/>\n<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fort/Ref/Will): 23/ 28/ 18 <em>\u2192 </em>27/ 32/ 22 (saves Vs spells)<br/>\n<br/>\n Naked/ Armoured AC: 32/ 35 (Clothes and Shield)<br/>\n<br/>\n BAB: 30 (Four attacks/ Five attacks with RS/ Six attacks Dual-Wielding)<br/>\n<br/>\n AB: +48/ +43/ +38/ +33 (Longbow against FE's)<br/>\n AB: +43/ +43/ +38/ +38/ +33/ +28 (Dual Short-Swords against FE's)<br/>\n<br/>\n DMG: 1d8 +2d6 +13/ 19-20 x3 (Longbow against FE's)<br/>\n DMG: 1d6 +2d6 +7/ 19-20 x2 (Dual Short-Swords aginst FE's)<br/>\n<br/>\n Point Blank Shot: +1AB/ +1 Dmg within 15 feet with Longbow<br/>\n Spellcasting: Ranger 4TH Circle Spellcasting, UMD access to scrolls, wands &amp; items<br/>\n Evasion/ Uncanny Dodge/ Deadly Trapmaster/ 2d6 Sneaks/ Very Stealthy/ Undispellable, Elvensight<br/>\n Ranger Companion: Black Puma with 10d6 Sneaks plus Darkfire Claws (Branch Of Giving) and GMF<br/>\n<br/>\n LEVELING GUIDE:<br/>\n 01) Ranger (01): Point Blank Shot, FE: [1]<br/>\n 02) Ranger (02):<br/>\n 03) Ranger (03): Rapid Shot<br/>\n 04) Ranger (04):<br/>\n 05) Ranger (05): FE: [2]<br/>\n 06) Ranger (06): Called Shot<br/>\n 07) Ranger (07):<br/>\n 08) Ranger (08):<br/>\n 09) Ranger (09): Blind Fight<br/>\n 10) Ranger (10): FE: [3]<br/>\n 11) Ranger (11):<br/>\n 12) Ranger (12): WF: Long Bow<br/>\n 13) Ranger (13):<br/>\n 14) Ranger (14):<br/>\n 15) Ranger (15): IC: Long Bow, FE: [4]<br/>\n 16) Ranger (16):<br/>\n 17) Ranger (17):<br/>\n 18) Ranger (18): Weapon Finesse<br/>\n 19) Ranger (19):<br/>\n 20) Ranger (20): FE: [5]<br/>\n 21) Ranger (21): Great Dexterity I<br/>\n 22) Ranger (22):<br/>\n 23) Ranger (23): Bane of Enemies<br/>\n 24) Rogue (01): Great Dexterity II<br/>\n 25) Fighter (01): EWF: Longbow<br/>\n 26) Rogue (02): <em>Evasion</em><br/>\n 27) Rogue (03): Great Dexterity III, <em>Uncanny Dodge</em><br/>\n 28) Fighter (02): Armour Skin<br/>\n 29) Fighter (03):<br/>\n 30) Fighter (04): WS: Long Bow, EWS: Long Bow<br/>\n 31) Ranger (24):<br/>\n 32) Ranger (25): FE: [6]<br/>\n 33) Ranger (26): Great Dexterity IV, FE: [7]<br/>\n 34) Ranger (27):<br/>\n 35) Ranger (28):<br/>\n 36) Ranger (29): Great Dexterity V, FE: [8]<br/>\n 37) Rogue (04):<br/>\n 38) Ranger (30): FE: [9]<br/>\n 39) Ranger (31): Great Dexterity VI<br/>\n 40) Ranger (32): Epic Prowess<br/>\n<br/>\n * Edit, to get WS &amp; EWS two level earlier.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
