(hopefully you won't with your speed and HiPS). The Will save is surprisingly better than it looks with +4 to spells and +2 to mind effects<br/>\nThe large number of rogue levels plus human race allows me to dump Int to 8 for other stats (I chose wisdom for extra will save + monk Wis AC, its like an iron will and armor skin feat), 300+ skill points was more than enough<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>3 APR / round single wielding non-kama\n6 APR / round with dual wielding + haste, fists + haste (or fists + flurry)\n8 APR / round with dual kamas + haste (or flurry)</details>\n\nHe's called the flash because he can move like lightning with the movement speed cap removed then HiPS and return to battle.<br/>\nLooked like an opponent I would not want to face<br/>\n<br/>\nI think about how I can defeat my own build when I design it, assuming it can be equipped with freedom, knockdown immunity, death immunity and use UMD for mind immunity.<br/>\nI would be thinking about a nice Bigby's 7, plus a few max IGMS's, or a pile of epic frost traps (Mages do get a good deal)<br/>\nDev crit or implosion might do ok but he is fast with HiPS and might be able to avoid such abilities against the fort save, which is not that high<br/>\nImproved Disarm against you would be a pain, I think epic dodge would protect you on the first attempt, but you might want to go unarmed in such a situation and equip monk gloves<br/>\nA dragon (they have True Seeing, and are Sneak Immune) with a fear aura who can cast Mords and Greater Dispelling would be a bit of a pain to face<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway that was my thoughts on taking toughness, so he can tank a bit more no save ILMS/ IGMS stuff, probably more useful than Epic Fort or another improved sneak attack, or trying to max discipline<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Rogue(33), Monk(6), Shadowdancer(1), Human\nSTR: 10\nCON: 14\nINT: 8\n\n01: Rogue(1): Ambidexterity, Two-Weapon Fighting\n03: Rogue(3): Weapon
