      "content": "<div>This little darling started from a simple request in the Unfinalized Buils section, and the collected wisdom of Empyre, Mick, Max and Valerfor have turned it into something I, if not they, am pleased to present to the Guild. I would not like to dismiss the influence of <strong>Tyr Templar's Green Beret </strong>(STR version), which can be found in the legacy archives (Monk 16 / Ranger 10 / CoT 14).<br/>\n<br/>\n Her build and mine differ in several aspects, hence the viability of posting this one. While 'tis true that Tyr's build has +1AB in dual-wield and another WF in Unarmed, this dear lady achieves Empty Body and Perfect Self, together with +3AC, 10% higher speed and increased Stunning Attacks and FoBs - let alone being immune to mind effects of spells. I also lose a tad on saves, but gain +4 SR and achieve DR of 20/+1. I also gain Expertise and Armour Skin, as well as the Knockdown twins being taken pre-epic. This is not to say this is a better build, merely one that can live long enough to reach epic levels, let alone enjoy their journey there. As ever, with me, this is about getting to level 40, not so much what you do when you're there ('cause if you don't know by then, you're playing the wrong game).<br/>\n<br/>\n I've done bits of editing here and there, but , if nothing else, I hope the discussion about the build is helpful for relative newbies. Essentially, this is the full story of her development...<br/>\n<br/>\n Bet the name made you look, though!<br/>\n ---------------------------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n Hello All, only me pestering everyone again. This time it's about my favourite single class - the Monk. I'm aware that I haven't played one for way too long (big hat-tip to Empyre for his Order of the Wyrm and Valerfor for the Ultimate Iron Fist, btw), and I thought I'd try to build my own with a bit of a twist, so I reckoned I'd bounce the concept around you guys before I go and make a hash of it.<br/>\n<br/>\n My thinking was actually triggered by considering the implications of the dual-wield/improved 2 weapon fighting Ranger feats (ie, only when in light armour) and how to counter the downside of that. Then it struck me that Monk AC improves as a matter of course, as well as getting the Evasions for free, so how about a Monk-Ranger? Then I thought, if I'm weaponising the character, how about some Fighter, so I can specialise?<br/>\n<br/>\n So, where I'm currently at is 9 or 10 levels of Ranger, 5 or 6 of Fighter and the rest in Monk (wouldn't a female one be a Nun?). Does this sound reasonable? And, if it does, and given that I'll be dual-wielding, does it have to be Kama, or could I use shortswords without penalty? Oh, and I'm looking to make the character human.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks in advance<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT</em></strong> - Oh, sorry, one more thing, and it's about WIS. I'm a little stumped: if WIS is supposed to give great benefits to the Monk AC, why do I see a stat of 8 in Valerfor's Iron Fist (DEX of 12)? Admittedly, his Grand Master of Flowers has 14 (ditto for DEX), but Empyre's two Order of the Wyrm builds have WIS 10 (Kama build) and 8 (Unarmed), both with 14 DEX, which further throws me! I see that Valerfor's Shock Trooper has 14 for both WIS and DEX, but then I noticed all 3 of Big V's builds are Half-Orcs, so I don't know what I can apply from any of them. I know that WIS would help with Ranger spells, but as I'm not looking to cast any, the point is moot at best. As ever, I'm looking at a STR-based build, so DEX would really only be for AC purposes, much as WIS would be, so I'm baffled as to which I should boost.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm very, very confused, so any guidance would be appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>CRIMSON NUN OF PAIN (Monk 20 / Ranger 10 / Champion of Torm 10)</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n Human - Female (the name's a clue) - Lawful, Good or Neutral<br/>\n Level 1-40, PvM<br/>\n<br/>\n STR 17 (34)<br/>\n DEX 10<br/>\n CON 12<br/>\n INT 13<br/>\n WIS 14<br/>\n CHA 8<br/>\n<br/>\n Hit Points: 440<br/>\n Saves: Fortitude 35, Reflex 28, Will 26<br/>\n Immune to disease, poison, mind-affecting spells<br/>\n SR 30, DR 20/+1, Speed +60%<br/>\n AC: naked - 26; f/plate - 20; f/plate + t/shield - 23<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"color:#FF0000\">AC, medium armor: 10 + 8tum +2AS +5arm = 25 (28 w/tower)<br/>\n [Note: None of the classes in this combo qualify for any heavier than medium armor.\u00a0 Wearing armor with/without shield will neutralize monk speed, WIS AC, monk AC and monk attack progression (-3BAB)\u00a0 for both 1H+DW even while using monk weaponry.]</span></strong><br/>\n<br/>\n Skill Points: 238.

      "content": "<div>It is a matter of min/maxing, you see by getting your Dexterity from 14 to 8 you lose three AC while by doing this with Wisdom you lose only two AC because there is no negative Wisdom-to-AC modifier for Monks. Furthermore, some class combinations that take WM with Monks simply can't have their Dexterity lowered so we do that with Wisdom in order to get some more points. Regardless though, the best Monks should always have 14's in both Wisdom &amp; Dexterity if you do not care so much about maximum AB's, more often-than-not the difference will just be, a single point. I second Empyre's proposal of COT as a third class, as not only they bring another safety factor (good saves) in the build but also eliminbate the exp penalty that a third main-class would bring to the table. You do not really need that ews when you have 30+ Strength already. About Tyr's build however, he is so close to the two best Monk feautures and he doesn't get them...Change split to Monk 20/ CoT 10/ Ranger 10 and everything will be better, mind-effects immunity alone deserves the loss of one CoT feat and +2 to saves. You will also get another point of AC (Monk 20) and 2x 20 rounds of undispellable 50% concealment (Monk 18)\u00a0 for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n Good luck with your project,</div>"

A build with these classes that focuses on Ranger levels rather than Monk. Ranger 26 Monk 10 Fighter 4 is a very good split. This kind of character still gets Evasion, Improved Evasion, Monk AC, all Ranger spells (provided you take 14 Wisdom) and Bane of Enemies whilst having Weapon Specialization and Epic Weapon Specialization in his Kamas (it's just better for a Monk / Ranger to wield Kamas, not only do they have the extra attacks per round, but also their secondary attacks come at -3 from one another rather than -5 for all other classes and / or weapons). This guy will be a monster at dealing damage, will not have such low AC due to Monk Wisdom AC AND will run faster than any other non-Monk toons, meaning you can engage anyone and disengage at will.<br/>\n<br/>\n Just thought I'd throw it out there.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Right then, time for a first draft. (Now lead post - cheers Hip)<br/>\n<br/>\n A few things first, though, if I may. 1) I've gone for a Monk 20 / Ranger 10 / CoT 10 - this is primarily because, having played (and thoroughly enjoyed) Monk many times, I'm more aware of the class's foibles and strengths (I think), so I may be less likely to screw it up. The Ranger 26 / Monk 10 / Fighter 4 is one I could return to at another time. 2) I've gone for WF etc in Kama only - this is because I'm trying to keep the build simple (again, less chance of going horribly wrong), and the original concept was for dual-wielding (much as I love unarmed combat, and the fist still won't be too shabby if bludgeoning is required). 3) In Skills, I've gone for some Concentration, but am quite happy to change that to Hide &amp; Move Silently if you think that would be better. 4) I still struggle with Damage and AB calculations, so these may be awry - sorry. Damage, in particular, seems low to me here, but maybe it's right and I've gone wrong somewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n Any comments and corrections gratefully received! <strong>(As they were - hence the build at the lead post)</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>edit: Build moved to <strong><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2354449/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">lead post</a></strong> per HipMaestro 20160908</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>One thing I dearly love about this Guild is that I/we can follow a build's progress from concept to reality (for want of a better word).

The reason for this is that you get your Animal Companion at 6, and since Monk and Ranger get the same skill points per level. You'll be down 1 AC from Tumble from levels 2-6, no biggie.<br/>\n<br/>\n 2- take 2 more monk pre-epic, save one CoT bonus feat for epics. <br/>\n<br/>\n 3- I don't think CoT bonus feats can be used to take save-enhancing feats.

      "content": "<div>Many thanks, Max - you've set me thinking (which is worrying in itself).<br/>\n<br/>\n If I take all Ranger from 1-6, then 1 Monk, it seems that I'd be as well taking Ranger 7-9 next - given that I won't be dual-wielding 'til I get Imp 2-Weapon Fighting anyway, nor will I be abandoning armour until the Monk element is up to speed. I could then take Monk 2-6 and a couple of CoTs at levels 16 and 17, followed by alternating Monk and CoT up to level 23, with CoT 6 coming at level 24. This would mean I could still get EWF, OwCrit and Dev Crit all in by this point. I could also bring the final level of Ranger forward to level 30 and use the bonus feat for another Favoured Enemy, and take the final 2 levels of CoT at 39 and 40 so the Monk could be her 'perfect self' for longer.<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and I could drop GFortitude altogether (the save is reasonable enough without it), bring WF in at level 1, take Iron Will at level 3 (Lightning Reflexes at level 9), make the CoT bonus feat Power Attack at level 17, and take Toughness at 15, with GCleave at 18 and Imp Crit left where it is at 12.<br/>\n<br/>\n Would these changes make for a better split?<br/>\n<br/>\n (PS - I would have done this as an edit, but I wanted to check with you guys first.)</div>",

I spot some finesse here. You save Cot 6 and Ranger 10 for epic levels so you can take epic combat feats. You free up general epic feats for Great strength and take the combat feats with CoT and Ranger bonus feats.<br/>\n But here is still room for improvement. Max gives some good advice with taking Ranger 6 asap, postpone 2 more CoT\u00a0levels to epic and take Toughness later.<br/>\n I can confirm that Iron will can not be taken as a CoT bonus feat. In my opinion, you don't really need it at all, since the character already has good saves and later gets Diamond soul and Perfect self. I would also remove Lightning reflexes since you get Improved evasion. I would keep Great fortitude\u00a0to improve survivability in a\u00a0Dev crit environment.<br/>\n That gives you enough feat slots to delay CoT 4 to epic and pick one more pre epic feat.<br/>\n I would take Ranger directly to 9 levels, only paused by a monk level at character level 7 for a tumble dump. Then I would have gone directly to monk 8 at level 17, with monk 6 and\u00a0Improved KD at level15, and build tumble gradually to 20 at level 17. The 3 pre epic CoT levels can come from level 18-20 with her Great cleavage\u00a0from the Cot 2 bonus feat at level 19.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now to that last pre epic feat. I would take Expertise, and I would take it at level 1. To be able to do that, I would start with Strength 17 and Intelligence 13.<br/>\n If you take Great strength with all 7 general epic feats, you still end up with str 34. And now you have an extra epic combat feat from CoT 4, enough for EWF, O crit, Dev crit, AS and EP. Take CoT from lvl 21 to 29, except for Monk\u00a0at lvl 22 and 27 for skill dumps. Then take the last Ranger level at level 30. And you have taken all your bonus combat feats by then.<br/>\n<br/>\n I would have taken pre epic feats in this order: LoH, Expertise, FE1, Blind F, FE2, PA, WF: Kama; IC: Kama, G Fortitude, Toughness, G Cleave. And the epic combat feats in this order: EWF: Kama, O crit, D crit, AS, EP.<br/>\n<br/>\n If you take Int 13 like I suggest, you get one more skill. My choice with this character is: Concentration 26 (27), Discipline 43 (55), Hide 43 (43), Listen 43 (45), Move silently 43 (43), Tumble 40 (40)<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0Edit:<em> 15: Monk 6, 16: CoT 1, 17: Monk 7, 18: CoT 2, 19: Monk 8, 20: CoT 3 is probably better with G Cleave 1 level earlier and more frequent skill dumps.\u00a0</em></div></div>",

      "content": "<div>That's brilliant, Mick - thank you. I think I was getting closer in my reply to Max, and you've confirmed that - which is good. I got the GFort / IWill / LRef stuff wrong, and am happy to change them accordingly and bring in Expertise - although I'm still unclear as to why to take that earlier than WF? As to PA, I confess that I delayed it primarily because I was regarding it only as a necessary step towards Dev Crit rather than as of any particular merit in its own right (my bad).<br/>\n<br/>\n As to the Epic levels, in my reply to Max I was trying to take better advantage of Monk, hence my delaying of the final 2 levels of CoT to 39 and 40 (with skills dump in Concentration), but if you think it's better this way round, fair-dos, I bow to greater knowledge.<br/>\n<br/>\n I do like what you say about Int 13 and Str 17, and will edit appropriately.<br/>\n<br/>\n I can't pretend to be much good at the stealthy stuff, but this build seems to yearn for it, so thanks for the inclusion of Hide and Move Silently. Actually, at the outset I was wondering about a Monk / Ranger / Assassin build, but I wanted to play it too, and I'm really not good with playing Evil - I even changed alignment before I could reach Assassin 1 in Valerfor's Shadow Avenger, which I was playing specifically to have a good run in The Gods Themselves. Never mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and the name - probably more suited to a different sort of 'specialized' website!</div>",

Glad I picked your post up before I did my edit, which I'm going to do now (oh, and I've remembered that CoT doesn't have Conc\u00a0 a class skill as well, which will also save me some embarrassment). You might notice in the edit that I've gone for Ow and Dev Crit before EWS - my thinking being that foes that are crit-able are more likely to be around earlier, so let's use it while we can. I've also tried some compromising on the class split by taking CoT 9 and 10 at 30 and 31, dropping Ranger 10 - and thereby Epic Prowess - to L40. I did this with defence in mind - both Monk and CoT (taking both Armor Skin and the final Sacred Defence at L31). Hope you don't mind too much.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers.</div>",

My problem is that I'm used to the OC now, and I've only (successfully) tried Knockdown once (against the boss Vampire in HotU), and that was only 'cos I was Last Chance Salooning it, so I've always been somewhat reticent in taking both the Knockdowns. It has been explained to me many times (thanks Valerfor!) how important and beneficial these feats are, so I do include them, but that's probably why I'm leaving the split as is in this particular build. I know, I know, I should be playing in other environments - and I will, promise.<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and just to let you know, I'm currently taking the optimum WM build you showed me about a month ago for a spin around SoU (which is lower magic than the OC, I believe, at least until Undrentide itself), and am having a lovely time with him so far - admittedly only at straight Fighter L9 so far, just leaving the Ao Camp. I was worried about only taking Disc sps, but it seems to be working ok for now. Looking forward to getting into WM - hopefully before petrification!<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks again</div>",

For now that's OK, but just left-clicking all the builds you play means that basically you're not enjoying the build's full potential and resourcefulness. When you start getting used to KDing (properly, by knowing your flurries and using them only on the highest attacks each round), you'll come to see that they are two of the best tools of a melee combatant. You avoid getting hit and targeted by spells when you successfully KD your enemies.
