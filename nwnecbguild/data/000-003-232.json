So I am making a Ranger21/Monk12/WM7? I have no idea if this is even i good split...I just know I want the BOE and from what I have seen in the past WM 7 is alright so that leaves me with 12 monk. Now i am thinking there is prob a better use of the lvl split I just not sure what that is. That is where all of your great minds come into play :) I do not know what I am doing with the starting stats so I went Str16,Dex14,Con10,Wis14,Int14,Cha8....I should of prob just went with the 14 across the board like Grizz did, I got caught up thinking more AB but now my HP is pretty low...I am duel wielding Kama's and I am a STR build.\u00a0Wanted this to be a PvP style build. I havent finished lvling it yet but I am afraid its doomed before it started. Any thoughts of how I can save this build or should I just scrap it? thank you.</div>"

      "content": "<div>There is a reason GDL did not make that build a \"Ranger 23/ Monk 10/ WM 7\" as you would not only lose 3 AB but also 3 epic feats that come from the WM itself. Then you would have to use your \"Great Strength\" feats to take them (EWF, AS, EP) and lose another point of AB at least, from the reduced strength of your build. All that to gain BoE but for only 5 FE's, which is really a gamble more than anything else. Stay with the Original, damage is plenty already with the cheat-kamas-ten-attacks-of-doom ;-)</div>"

      "content": "<div>Actually, what you NEED are Monk 6 for IKD, Ranger 9 for dual-wielding and Wm 16 for AB and feats. I might also suggest an alternative spread that is not better or worse than the Preying Mantis: ranger 15 / Monk 9 / WM 16. You lose 1 AC From Monk 10, 1 AB from WM 19, but you don't lose the feat because if you take Ranger 15 in EPICS you'll be able to take Epic Prowess with it. What you gain is Level 4 Ranger spells (Mass Camouflage, anyone?), more skill points and skill dumps for trap skills. It's worth a mention, which incidentally was done by Jenalee in the last post that I just read after typing all this shit lol</div>"
