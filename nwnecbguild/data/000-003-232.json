(Nearly, taking over a town, nearly, destroying a guardsmen faction, and going on a Drow killing spree 1v 20 x.x Yeah, I got 7....then I got hit like....hard ish xD for....probably over 60% of my hp and died xD ^^. That's where I ended his long twisted RP story. But, I'm curious about a battle cleric, I saw you guys talking about it since that healing cleric o.o. And was kinda curious about that myself (not the healer, the battle aspect you talked about.) Just sorta interested in those thoughts of yours. Now, nothing is set in stone yet, but I might as well give the basic information? Arelith 30 cap.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Well, as a general rule, here's how it works:<br/>\n<br/>\n Each +1 in STR modifier will increase your AB and DAMAGE by 1<br/>\n Each +1 in DEX modifier will increase your AB and AC by 1 (with the Weapon Finesse feat, which you should always take for DEX toons)<br/>\n<br/>\n So, it's basically a choice between doing more damage or having a higher AC. However, as I will state here, that's not necessarily true for Cleric / Monks, because they can multiply the added damage given by Cleric buffs by the insane number of attacks per round given by Monk attack progression with a Kama, even with\u00a0the pathetic little Kama (by all means a terrible weapon on its own)\u00a0for loads of damage too. If they dual-wield, against non-resistant monsters or enemies, they might even do more damage than a STR toon. However, something similar can be said for STR-based Cleric / PM toons. They will do loads of damage, while still having a pretty good AC thanks to Bone Skin. So it's really a personal choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, there are classes that go better with a STR Cleric and there are others that work better with a DEX Cleric. STR Clerics can go with RDD for obscene STR and damage potential and even a bit of AC. DEX clerics can go with Monk, Rogue, SD, Assassin (although you can make a STR-based Cleric / Assassin too). CoT can work with both STR and DEX, as can Fighter.<br/>\n<br/>\n Clerics already need to invest in Wisdom for their spells, so you won't have enormous stats, because your Wisdom needs to be at least 18 to cast level 8 spells, 19 or 20 to cast level 9 ones. That means you will be pretty wimpy when unbuffed, but when you buff up, you'll be close to unstoppable! Either way is fine, so you can choose whether you want a guy who can stand in front of enemies for a longer time (DEX-based) or a guy who kills things much\u00a0faster, but can also be killed much faster (STR-based).<br/>\n<br/>\n I hope this points you in the right direction.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
