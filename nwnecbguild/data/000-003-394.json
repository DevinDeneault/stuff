(So if the build required it, I'd eventually have to application for it, which i would i guess try for)<br/>\n<br/>\n- All prestige classes must have at least 5 levels in them<br/>\n<br/>\n- All prestige classes are available, with the exception of Harper Scout and Purple Dragon Knights; Red Dragon Disciples can only be taken by outlander (e.g. non-native) characters.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I have played a bit on Ravenloft. The playerbase there has an amazing commitment to the RP. But there is plenty of opportunity for PvM - and PvP as long as the conflict is based on actual RP.<br/>\nAs for build advice: The server is low magic and the encounters are generally difficult and geared towards playing in groups. Playing a caster is definitely easier, even though soloing can be difficult even then.<br/>\nThe characters there get more feats than normal \"so you don't have to choose\" between picking feats for power- or roleplay reasons. There are several custom feats and even custom skills. So it is difficult to come up with specific builds.<br/>\nYou are not allowed to multiclass monks and paladins.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

They tend to mature late in epic levels, and will never be \"best\" at anything. For lvl 1-20 or 8-13 as indicated in the topic title, it is better to focus on either being a melee character or a mage.<br/>\nIn a low magic setting a wizard will be stronger than a fighter once you start to get any significant spells, and a fully buffed wizard will actually be a strong melee character (see the \"Melee mage\")<br/>\n<br/>\nThe cleric, druid and bard classes in NWN are designed to be self buffing \"fighters\".<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
