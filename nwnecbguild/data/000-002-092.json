What are the factors taken into account? What custom modifications impact it?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">In general, there's no way of knowing for a specific environment. The Lore required to identify an item (and the UMD required to use a restricted item) can be altered by editing 2da files, so there's no guarantee that the default values apply to your specific environment. The cost of an item is determined by the base item type (eg. dagger, longsword, small shield) and the item properties on the item, and all of this can be customised too.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a vanilla environment, you can use the toolset to check item value. That way you can calculate the cost of the most expensive item that you're likely to encounter and set your Lore accordingly. Bear in mind that Identify and Legend Lore also give Lore bonuses which can be useful if they're easily available.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Shame. Alright, with even more faffing, how about creating a character with (for example) 20 Lore, beam them into wherever you're playing and see if they can id what you want, if not, try one with 30 ranks, then 40, and so on until you can id the item(s). That gives you a 10 point Lore window, which you can then narrow further should you wish - maybe try (eg) 35 ranks if you know you need between 30 and 40, and narrow it down progressively, depending on how obsessive you're feeling.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I say, highly faff-intensive, but hey-ho.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I won't do it because it's too much trouble, and WoG has a loot system that has different tiers of items, so it's kind of crazy. Something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Green (Enchanted is the name, I think)<br/>\n- Purple (Epic)<br/>\n- Teal (Dweomic)<br/>\n- Golden (Legendary)<br/>\n- Some other color I don't know because I never found any of these, but I know they exist (Titan)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe enhancement bonus doesn't change much, it's +5 or +6 tops, but the number of properties increases and they tend to be more powerful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thanks for letting everyone know about this. I'm sure we'll find an OCD Wogger who can do this to figure out the UMD they need to equip such items and the Lore required to ID them.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
