All credit goes out to the original author - I just made these small tweaks. Enjoy crafting, brewing and scribing without fear of being underleveled in your single player modules!<br/>\n<br/>\nLink:\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/script/craft-wand-improved-no-exp-cost\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://neverwintervault.org/project/nw ... o-exp-cost</a></div>"

In the meantime, if any of you guys have any suggestions to this override, please say so. Whether it be a .2da settings file to adjust things, console commands etc.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm just starting to learn NWScripting and it's... It's like investigating a murder through 15 year old forum posts, reading maybe-useful-scripts-but-who-really-knows and documentation for functions in unknown files with no way of easily finding what I'm looking for. But it's finally starting to make sense, somehow.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em class=\"mention\">@Valerfor</em>\u00a0I tried to balance things by increasing gold price by 10 percent. This override is meant for single player modules where being underleveled <strong>sucks </strong>(imo). If this isn't enough... I guess I should really add a way to more easily adjust the XP and Gold cost ratios.\u00a0</div>"
