This build aims to go heavy on the \u201cspellbow\u201d aspect of the class, in order to save spell slots and to be able to deal with spell-resistant enemies. Four Fighter levels bring in bow proficiency, +6 damage, and a feat. The Monk level provides the usual cheesy Tumble dump, Listen dump, Wisdom AC, and Evasion.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the choices and the overall build should be compared to the finest of the caster Cleric builds we have around, Maximillian Kane's\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/demolition-man-cleric-38-monk-1-rogue-1-t515420.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Demolition Man</a>.<br/>\nAs far as casting goes, he gets 3 more caster levels, we get Extend Spell and Scribe Scroll. The CL are important and will be felt, not much to say there. I personally like Scribe Scrolls a lot when you have so many no-save spells or buffs which retain their awesomeness in scroll form (consider e.g. Harm, WoF, Mass Heal). Extend gives you a little spellbook management, and most importantly triples DF, DP and Haste uptime.<br/>\nAs for archering, the Demolition Man has 1 more AB, Point Blank Shot, and Rapid Shot. We have Blind Fight, Improved Critical, and EWS. I claim that we have a lot more damage across a variety of combat situations.<br/>\nSpecial mention goes to Rapid Shot: as I <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/viewtopic.php?p=24933#p24933\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">have argued</a>,\u00a0Rapid Shot will only be useful for a hasted Cleric if the defender has 20 AC more than your AB (which will be rare with this build) or if your AB is higher than the defender\u2019s AC. Now the latter will happen given your sky-high AB values, but only for mob-type enemies, and (assuming they can be critted) in this case Improved Crit is better than Rapid Shot.<br/>\nThe real major sacrifice I made in this build compared to the Demolition Man is not getting levels in a UMD class. I personally don\u2019t mind most of the time, but the ability to use arcane scrolls (especially Breach effects) is also very strong. One possible alternative is to use Rogue instead of Monk as your minor class, but you lose up to 26 AC which I find a bit much.\u00a0 In the end, if you want a bit more boring power to your arrows and you don't mind losing UMD and 3 CL, this might be a build for you!\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nApart from the Demolition Man, I looked for builds with Cleric 32+ and EWS:bow, and the only decent one I found is <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build286554.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ranged Nuker</a>, which opts to go Rogue instead of Monk and does a good job at avoiding XP penalty. I find the feat choices very debatable, and it only reaches 32 WIS.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall I like this build, I feel like it has good enough firepower to be able to save its best spells for the boss fights. Example spellbook:<br/>\nLevel 1: Prot from alignment, Divine Favor<br/>\nLevel 2: Extended Divine Favor<br/>\nLevel 3: Darkfire, Extended buffs<br/>\nLevel 4: Hammer of the Gods<br/>\nLevel 5: Extended Divine Power, Spell Resistance<br/>\nLevel 6: Blade Barrier, Harm, Extended Haste<br/>\nLevel 7: Word of Faith, Extended BB<br/>\nLevel 8: Fire Storm, Mass Heal<br/>\nLevel 9: Implosion, SoV<br/>\nScrolls: Dispel Magic, Heal, WoF, Harm, Battletide, SR, Regenerate, Mass Heal, Summon IX.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see, lots of offensive options, both damaging and not, both hard-to-save-against and no-save. Darkfire is only there because on WoG you can cast it on arrows. Casting spells is fun, sniping blind enemies who cluelessly walk into blade barriers is more fun! Enjoy Cleric power!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>BONUS:</strong> some will think this build is hard to level without an early Monk level, so I include a more impatient/novice-friendly version with much the same stats. The only important loss is 3 caster levels, which might come back to bite you. This version suffers an XP penalty from level 29 on.<br/>\nI think it\u2019s better to take the extra Monk level pre-epic: you gain earlier boni (duh) and +2 to all saves. You lose 1 AB, but that matters not 99% of the time, as you will fight with DP giving +6 instead of +5. The extra AB only matters when you actually buff to the cap (including Prayer and Battletide), which at least in my playstyle is very rare.\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>More playable boring caster Cleric\n\nDEX: 12\nWIS: 18 (38)\nCHA: 8\nHuman: (Quick to Master)\n02: Cleric(2)\n04: Cleric(4): WIS+1, (WIS=19)\n06: Cleric(6): Zen Archery\n08: Cleric(8): WIS+1, (WIS=20)\n10: Cleric(10)\n12: Cleric(12): WIS+1, Spell Focus: Evocation, (WIS=21)\n14: Cleric(14)\n16: Cleric(16): WIS+1, (WIS=22)\n18: Fighter(1): Improved Critical: Shortbow, Weapon Focus: Shortbow\n20: Monk(1): WIS+1, {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}, (WIS=23)\n22: Cleric(20)\n24: Cleric(22): WIS+1, Great Wisdom I, (WIS=25)\n26: Cleric(24)\n28: Fighter(2): WIS+1, Epic Weapon Focus: Shortbow, (WIS=28)\n30: Fighter(4): Great Wisdom IV, Weapon Specialization: Shortbow, (WIS=29)\n32: Fighter(6): WIS+1, Epic Weapon Specialization: Shortbow, (WIS=30)\n34: Cleric(27)\n36: Cleric(29): WIS+1, Great Wisdom VII, Great Wisdom VIII, (WIS=35)\n38: Cleric(30)\n40: Cleric(32): WIS+1, Great Wisdom X, (WIS=38)\n* Again any domain after Travel works.\nHitpoints: 412\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 27/37/19 (+8 vs spells)\nAB (max, naked): 23 (melee), 41 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Cleric(9)\n\n\n02: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(6),\u00a0\n04: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(10),\u00a0\n06: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(14),\u00a0\n08: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(18),\u00a0\n10: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(22),\u00a0\n12: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(26),\u00a0\n14: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(30),\u00a0\n16: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(34),\u00a0\n18: Concentration(1), Save(39),\u00a0\n20: Concentration(1), Listen(20), Tumble(20), Save(5),\u00a0\n22: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(8),\u00a0\n24: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(12),\u00a0\n26: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(16),\u00a0\n28: Concentration(1), Save(21),\u00a0\n30: Concentration(1), Save(27),\u00a0\n32: Concentration(1), Save(33),\u00a0\n34: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(32),\u00a0\n36: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(36),\u00a0\n38: Concentration(1), Search(1), Spellcraft(2),\u00a0\n40: Concentration(1), Search(1), Spellcraft(1)\n</details></div>"

So, PBS basically adds +5 AB when shooting arrows in close combat, which sure is a lot of AB. CS (leg), on the other hand, <em>assumes</em> you have high AB and acts as a pseudo-ranged-KD, i.e. it does not allow enemies who fall for it to try to hit you and reduces their AC.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if you are in melee range with enemies while playing this build, you should probably just use spells anyway. Summon, cast Hammer/WoF/Harm/Implosion/SoV, and get out of said melee range. On the other hand, if you find yourself in an open area, you do have enough AB to make very good use of CS and \"kite\" enemies around forever without spending a single spell. This is especially handy against enemies with high SR, as the build would really struggle to beat them otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a bonus, CS is <em>amazing </em>with Blade Barriers. Not only can you keep monsters in them, you also lower their Reflex save! Four CS:leg is another Greater Spell Focus! As a further bonus, you get the ability to use CS:arm for free with the same feat. This is very nice to have when playing with a party (or a summon) to make enemies helpless and unable to hit while you keep raining arrows on them. Think of it as pseudo-ranged-Disarm :)<br/>\n<br/>\nPhilosophically, and TL;DR: Point Blank Shot is for this build \"more of the same\", while Called Shot adds other tools to your toolbox. I like the latter more, but if playing in a module/PW where you are forced to melee all the time maybe PBS is better. Interested in hearing people's opinions on this, and Empyre's explanation of their preference, as I might be missing something and have not played a lot with either feat.</div>"

Especially early on when AB is rather plain, you only have a single attack and you often don't have the speed to evade a group of chasing foes,  then every hit counts. Rapid shot is my next go to. Even if AB is lower you get a second attempt. And that is great against low AC foes. CS comes much later.

Unlike other ranged builds, in melee your best option will never be to shoot arrows, even if you were to have PBS. So I still like the increased flexibility that CS gives you here, but I hear you all and will try variations to this.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nRe: RS and early levels. Obviously RS is great in early levels, and it's great against low AC. This is a Cleric though, it's a pleasure cruise until level 20 at least! And when you start having 3 attacks, Haste and DP, RS is just bad vs anything with more AC than your AB.</div>"
