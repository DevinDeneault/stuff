      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hey guys. I've been looking every where the a melee cleric build that doesn't incorporate monk or rdd levels. Really frustrating as theres not many forums left for nwn anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\n The server I play on is to max lvl 40. Its a roleplayer server so the character needs to be chaotic evil. Not sure but might be able to get away with chaotic neutral and use COT class if thats an option (Rp as champion of Lloth). I've really been thinking the character would be a cleric and some kind of fighter? Taking a straight level 40 cleric doesn't seem right.<br/>\n<br/>\n It's not a heavily populated server so their would be little pvp.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Medium level magic settings, Its been a while since I've played nwn but the highest rated items you could get were +7 if I remember correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\n Theres no real other rules or anything that you need to be aware of really though dev crit is disabled I believe or heavily nerfed so no point investing in that. The sub race drow doesn't get any extra stats.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n It's a bit of a grindy server and I have alot of real life commitments so please no base class crossing if possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n My idea is to be a melee centred cleric. Taking advantage of the elf racial and using a rapier and also a shield. Stabbing enemies in the face with her rapier and casting harm on anything that deserves it. Preferably strength based please regardless of the rapier, thats just because the weapon suits a drow better.<br/>\n<br/>\n For domains I was thinking magic and strength?<br/>\n<br/>\n So too recap. A chaotic evil/neutral depending if COT is used, drow melee cleric who can cast all cleric spells with good penetration, hard too dispel and is capable in melee with a rapier and shield. Please avoid the xp penalties if possible but in the end if it comes to gimping a build or the penatly I'll just have to take longer grinding it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks guys and any extra information you need I'll do my best.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Correct?<br/>\n<br/>\n To avoid the XP penalty that would be either a CE clc/ftr/asn or CN clc/CoT/rog.\u00a0 Sound like something that would interest you?\u00a0\u00a0 Access to all arcane scrolls in either case.<br/>\n<br/>\n TBH, I think you are missing a bet with cleric going plate/tower STR with a DEX race instead of robes/lighter shield DEX but if that is your preference, so be it.\u00a0 The rapier is kinda a natural finessing weapon. You can forget building a stealth toon, though, because the armor/shield penalties will kill that idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n Do you plan to exploit Divine Power BAB 15 or just reach for the highest BAB possible?<br/>\n<br/>\n Is there permahaste props on the server?\u00a0 If not, you'll be needing Travel domain.\u00a0 My second choice would be Strength just as you have suggested UNLESS there are no Imp Invis scrolls available, then would opt for Trickery to also boost the asn or rog skills and operate with the default DP slots.\u00a0 What about scrolls?\u00a0 Are there merchants that provide a typical supply of arcane scrolls and wands?<br/>\n<br/>\n I don't understand the benefit of the Magic domain at all.\u00a0 Mage Armor is essentially worthless with Magic Vest x2 (MA's +1 dodge... Woohoo!).\u00a0 Melf's arrow is too low damage to be of much value.\u00a0 Cleric doesn't need NEB with the ability to cast so many negative energy spells (like Inflict/Harm).\u00a0 Stoneskin you get with Strength domain.\u00a0 So, in effect you'll be taking Magic domain to cast Level 5 Icestorms.\u00a0 Is that your priority?<br/>\n<br/>\n Does your server use a Divinity system like WoG implements?\u00a0 That forces a cleric to declare a divine association during creation and each divinity has a rigid pair of domains associated with it.\u00a0 Also, choosing a divinity is further limited by alignment restrictions.\u00a0 Just wondering.\u00a0 Sometimes servers devise a way to nerf the cleric class by limiting domains so am checking quick before we assume too much.<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I use to role play in nwn years and years ago and wanted to get back into it with my bro since there's not many good games out these days.<br/>\n<br/>\n The sub race gets<span style=\"color:#39424D\">: dark vision, Spell Resistance: Innate spell resistance of 10 plus 2 every 4 levels.

I'm just a dumb noob here.</span><br/>\n<br/>\n I intend to use divine power that's why I wanted to use the strength domain. There is permenent haste available so travel isn't necessary. I just thought magic would be a good domain to take. Though maybe trickery would be good?<br/>\n<br/>\n There is no divinity system in place too worry about.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also I'm sorry but looking at the server wiki I can't seem to find the cleric is drow favoured class.

(and Fox's to increase saves vs spells if there is room).\u00a0 There won't be slots to spare for Extended DP.\u00a0 Extended Level 4 DP will only compete with Spell Resistance which may not be necessary when SR item props are equipped.\u00a0 So Level 5 slots should be mainly DP.\u00a0\u00a0 Rather than Strength's Stoneskin, instead choose Earth domain for its arcane spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also notice that most of the 1x/day special abilities that have duration are practically worthless without higher CHA and even with an empowered casting of Eagle's, won't last long enough to affect combat much.\u00a0 So, for all intents and purposes, ignore them.<br/>\n<br/>\n Robes vs. full plate - besides the potential encumbrance issue with a Dex build, robes will provide more AC. The unbuffed DEX AC will be 9 vs full plate 8+1 DEX which is a tie. But up to +3 more with Emp Cat's buff (and up to +6 when ability cap is met with items).\u00a0 Assuming equal AC bonus enhancements, the comparison is 15 AC vs 9 AC maximum difference.\u00a0 UMD will provide access to arcane and monk robes/gear.<br/>\n<br/>\n Shield - Any shield works fine except should be unequipped when setting traps if you stick with those skills.<br/>\n<br/>\n AB buffed potential: 39 + 6 (DEX cap) + 7 (max server enhancement) + 1 Aid + 1 Bless +1 DF +2 Battletide +1 Prayer +4 DP = 62\u00a0 Note:\u00a0 Haven't checked this but it might be slightly over the +20 AB cap that most servers use.\u00a0 At any rate, the buffed AB will be at least 59.<br/>\n<br/>\n If the build seems interesting to you, I will help you work out the details and perhaps others will have further suggestions to improve it.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Now to analyze your list...<br/>\n<br/>\n 1.\u00a0 Cleric opener instead of rogue opener means fewer total skill points... but for this build there are plenty to spare so go for early spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n 2.\u00a0 Set up an extra Lvl 3 slot at Clc 5 by taking one WIS bump (to 16) before (or at) Clc 5.\u00a0 Lvl 8 would be the best choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n 3.\u00a0 By taking the 2nd WIS bump at the end of pre-epic, it guarantees you will gain a Lvl 4 slot on the CoT level where you take Grt WIS, and that should be ASAP.<br/>\n<br/>\n 4. CoT 5-8 should be taken immediately in epic (21-24) to grab EWF and the Grt WIS (comment, note 3).\u00a0 The extra saves and d10 doesn't hurt either.\u00a0 This way, all the <strong>general</strong> feats can be assigned to Grt DEX to reach Epic Dodge ASAP.\u00a0 With fighter and CoT, using the bonus feat slots for combat feats/general feats for Grt abilities is the trick to reach the high ability prereqs for ED and DevCrit early (and Dragon shape with CoT)... so write that one down.<br/>\n<br/>\n 5.\u00a0 Epic Dodge requires Tumble 30 (minimum of Lvl 27 to reach this), DEX 25 (Lvl 28 earliest here) and Rog 13 (means 5 levels of rogue in epic but due to threat of XP penalty must be alternated with Clc levels).\u00a0 Rog 13 is the toughest prereq to meet in this build combo unless you ignore the XP penalty altogether, then could get ED as early as Lvl 30.<br/>\n<br/>\n 6. Your last rogue level at 36 will cost -1 Tumble AC.\u00a0\u00a0 Level 37 works, though.\u00a0 I had set the rogue dump level at 38 thinking I may want to reach UMD 40 should there be very expensive class-specific items to equip.\u00a0 So, if items like that are available we may want to juggle some of the skill allotments around to achieve that with a dump at 38.\u00a0 Like I said, there are plenty of skill points to play with.\u00a0 At the current UMD level plan, all arcane spells via scrolls will cast without failure.<br/>\n<br/>\n 7. Your AB potential and AC level will be so high that delaying Prowess and Armor Skin late should have little impact.\u00a0 I consider them icing on the cake in this build. I wouldn't make them a priority.<br/>\n<br/>\n Okay, must run now so digest this and make a revised attempt by simply editing the list posted rather than extending the thread longer with copies of it.\u00a0 I will be watching so won't miss an edit, I assure you.\u00a0 If you have questions about my comments, then make a new post for that reason.\u00a0 Let's try to use your listing dynamically to prevent confusion.<br/>\n<br/>\n I do have two questions for you, though:<br/>\n<br/>\n A.\u00a0 How available are arcane spell scrolls and how high level spell scrolls are sold?<br/>\n B.\u00a0 Does Expertise mode work while spellcasting on this server?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
