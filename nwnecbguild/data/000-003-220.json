This is my first time posting (as you've probably guessed) but I've been an avid forum browser for a while now.<br/>\n<br/>\n One of the class combos which I've wanted to try for ages has been a Monk/Palemaster build. I'm planning to take it through SoU and HotU, as well as The Gods Themselves and maybe the Sands of Time (I think that's the name?).<br/>\n<br/>\n I did find one build that interested me on the old forums (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build221315.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 21315.html</a>), but I wanted to ask for your thoughts on it, and whether you'd do anything differently with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

With this build, you are going to get 1 million more AC than you know what to do with, especially for modules this is overkill. In Hotu/ SoF series (very high magic) AC items are everywhere, not to mention the immunities. Instead try for a good STR-based Pale Master with some serious AB &amp; Damage and enjoy yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n Here is a good PM warrior that you could use, <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2352387/DEADEYES-BERSERKER-BARBARIAN-24-PM-12-BARD-4#.VUuxSpNS2r8\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/23 ...

What do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\n What I think I'll do is take your advice and give the Dead-Eyes Berserker a try for now though, and maybe revisit the Monk/Palemaster another time. <br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks for the help!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hey Cosmic Tomato. I like you already! You want to try out building a toon yourself, which is something quite rare to see around here these days. Your initiative is appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\n Don't worry about the \"too many builds syndrome\". We all suffer from it over here LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for the build itself, you could go with a slightly different split and not worry about epic spells. Basically, the base duration of the epic spells is based on the number of WIZARD levels that you'll have, so your Epic Mage Armor will last a WHOPPING 3 hours. That's just terrible. Depending on the encounter you face, say, Mephistopheles fight, it's not even going to last you the whole fight!<br/>\n<br/>\n If we reduce the PM levels to 10 for all the immunities, we can go with Monk 25 for an extra bonus feat and take 5 Wizard levels for another Bonus Feat, which you can use to take Extend Spell to have, Extended Mage Armor, Extended Protection from Evil, Extended Cat's Grace and Extended Bull's Strength for 10 hours a day (much better than 3 hours of EMA) and Extended Shield and Extended Ghostly Visage for 5 hours a day. Your AC won't be that much lower, because Monks get 1 extra AC point every 5 levels with Monk AC (so this build will have +1 AC than yours) and you'll have a comboed PM and Monk immunities. Not to mention you will be able to use the Expeditious Retreat exploit <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\n I would advise STR-based for this combo, since damage output may be low, and you have 2 classes that give some form of AC bonus, but no dual-wielding due to AB concerns. Also, Monk 20 straight, Wizard 3, PM 10 then save the two last Wizard levels for Spellcraft dumps and round up the build with Monk. I would consider going Unarmed instead of Kamas, because you will be doing 1d20 of punch damage if you go Human after Monk 16. I think that'd be more advisable than wielding Kamas, since you have virtually no buffs that can enhance the Kama damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n Last but not least, please read my Complete Guide to the Basics of Building in the Game Guides Section. It'll help you define a list of priorities for the build.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Monk 25/ Wizard 5/ Pale Master 10, is what i would propose myself as well, if nothing else for that sweet permanent 35 SR that you get and mind-effects immunity plus the 2/day undispellable 50% concealment for 25 rounds each. However, given the environment that you are going to play (high magic modules), i would rather suggest focusing in kama(s) instead of going unarmed (much that i don't like them myself). You see, you cannot \"forge\" the gloves but you can do that with kama(s). Furthermore, Sands Of Fate have their own upgrades to your selected weapon(s) so you are going to miss even more\u00a0 stuff from there, like permanent True Sight, Haste, 2d6 elemental damage, Regeneration and so on, that you are going to have when wield a weapon in your hands, for these reasons alone i would say kama(s) are a far better choice for you, unless you simply want to go the Kung-Fu way like a true martial artist. Obviously, you should follow the STR way, since your defences will already be very good with all these innate immunities and high AC of this build.<br/>\n<br/>\n Something else, the Epic Spells i believe they have their duration and properties based on your PM level (highest), regardless it is simply better to have more Monk levels instead.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It'll be almost irrelevant with all the other enhancements if you go the weapon route. Also, GMW gives enhancement that is lower than the enhancement that you can add to any weapon at Rizolvir's forge, therefore irrelevant for this build, since only the highest will apply. The buffs don't get dispelled, but it's not really important. Still, Cosmic Tomato, I would go unarmed. Fuck all of Rizolvir's enhancements. In Sands of Fate there are some ANNOYING AS HELL slimes that eat your weapons. You'll be IMMUNE TO THEM!<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Val<br/>\n<br/>\n You're right about the duration of epic spells.

I definitely had Max's Shadow Priest on my mind when I was posting, so compared to stuff like Divine Favour and Divine Power, the Wizard spells seemed a little bit lacking. Honestly though, when I buffed up, I could one shot pretty much anything, even that Adamantium Golem sat in the Maker's Sanctuary (which gave ten-year old me so much trouble back in the day). The damage was actually terrifying.<br/>\n<br/>\n Many thanks for all the suggestions about the build too. I was turning some ideas over in my head and considering going for a more Dex/caster build with just three monk levels to get the speed and evasion, so honestly I really need to consider what I want from the combination before I start building. The 25/5/10 split seems really good as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n Right now though, I have some pretty awesome monk builds I really want to try out.

Looking at the old forums again, I saw that somebody already had posted a 25/5/10, STR-based, unarmed monk (which I'm also going to have to try).

Also I wasn't sure about what feats might be optimal for a Wizard character. I had far too many feats than I knew what to do with, so I went with the reflex boosting ones to get some more benefit out of evasion.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers guys!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You have no way of killing things for the first 20 lvls in this build. You AB is low, so you won't hit anything, and you don't have many spells because you stop your casting progression to take PM levels. Generally, when leveling a toon that relies on spells to kill things, which is the case with a 36 INT wizard, you want to have all the spells ASAP. If you're going to be a near-pure caster, you should not take anything else for the first 17 levels (18 for Sorcerer) save very few exceptions. Most of the time, you'll be wishing you had more spells with this kind of toon.<br/>\n<br/>\n I respect you for trying. But you need to understand what's the synergy that you're trying to explore when you're building a PM / Monk. That's what Valerfor and I have been trying to explain to you. What's the synergy between these classes that would make you want to build a toon with them? In a previous topic a while back, campgod asked why there weren't any Assassin / CoT builds in the ECB. My answer to him was: because CoT has nothing to add to a silent killer and Assassin has nothing to add to a high-save fighter. Anything that the Assassin class would do for CoT, Rogue does better, and anything that the CoT class would do to an Assassin, Fighter does better, so there is no synergy there to justify an alignment change.<br/>\n<br/>\n Unlike in that topic, this combo is quite synergetic, but that won't do you any good if you don't figure out WHAT the synergy is. It's in the IMMUNITIES! PM has tons of immunities and so does Monk, but the Monk ones only come in the higher levels of the build, hence the need for many Monk levels. The speed thing is more like a fortunate side effect than a reason to make a build. Now, Monk gives bonus AC through Wisdom, PM gives bonus AC through Bone Skin, so there's another synergy for you. However, in the AB department, it's not all that good, since it won't be very self-buffable, it doesn't have a full BAB class in the mix and it won't have UMD, so there's not much you can do in that department, except casting from Wizard scrolls when things get nasty. This is more like a characteristic weakness of the combo that you can't overcome. However, near pure mages and heavy meleers will suffer against you because you run like shit, are immune to criticals AND spell-resistant\u00a0and their ACs are nothing to write home about, so you'll pop in and kick their asses, zero the mages and get out before meleers can retaliate. Spellswords, clerics and other high AC builds will be your undoing, no such thing as a do-it-all build. Try to make a 25 / 5 / 10 and let's go from there, brother!<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The speed thing is more like a fortunate side effect than a reason to make a build. Now, Monk gives bonus AC through Wisdom, PM gives bonus AC through Bone Skin, so there's another synergy for you. However, in the AB department, it's not all that good, since it won't be very self-buffable, it doesn't have a full BAB class in the mix and it won't have UMD, so there's not much you can do in that department, except casting from Wizard scrolls when things get nasty. This is more like a characteristic weakness of the combo that you can't overcome. However, near pure mages and heavy meleers will suffer against you because you run like shit, are immune to criticals AND spell-resistant\u00a0and their ACs are nothing to write home about, so you'll pop in and kick their asses, zero the mages and get out before meleers can retaliate. Spellswords, clerics and other high AC builds will be your undoing, no such thing as a do-it-all build. Try to make a 25 / 5 / 10 and let's go from there, brother!<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div></blockquote>\n Hmm. How does this look for starters?

You can take Expertise for Power Attack and either Improved Expertise or Called Shot for Great Cleave.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n What Expertise and Improved Expertise will do for you is that they will pretty much give you the mathematical advantage in every combat. If you ever find a foe who can hit you more than you can hit them (hard, but theoretically possible), you can turn the tide in your favor by activating Expertise or Improved Expertise mode, because they'll only hit you on 20s and you'll only hit them on 20s, but they have 4 or 5 attacks per round, you have 6 or 7,\u00a0and you do 1d20 damage with your punches, they'll do less for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n With these tweaks, you won't get hit much, so I would switch CON and DEX scores. You gain 2 AC, 2 Reflex\u00a0and 2 ranged AB (great for leveling)\u00a0and lose 80 HP and 2 Fortitude. Do what Valerfor suggested and take Epic Weapon Focus and Armor Skin. In this build, I'd take EWF before AS. Do that at 21 and 24. Don't drop ISR. it's a goid feat for a high level monk and it'll prevent spellswords from casting on u most of the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I think the feat order could maybe do with some tweaking, otherwise I think it looks pretty sweet. If you guys don't see any glaring problems, do you mind if I add it to the list of level 40 builds at some point in the future? I might run it through at least SoU/HotU to get a little bit of an idea how it should be played before I do though. [EDIT: Included Blind Fight into the list of the feats (left it out accidently, d'oh!). I'm taking it at 15 for the Duergar at the start of HotU, but people can take it earlier depending on where they play. Also, Toughness is staying to keep HPs up and give a little bit of extra security. Lightning Reflexes was chosen over Great Fortitude because of Evasion.]<br/>\nSpoiler [+]\n<table class=\"post_content_table\"><tbody><tr><td>Monk(25), Illusionist(5), Pale Master(10),

But again, that's not really noticeable playing the OCs. I imagine that a Monk 12\u00a0Wizard 4 PM 4 could dual-wield in HoTU with no problem. After that, in SoF, with the crazy weapons from Rizolvir, you could hit anything with a Pure Wizard with a staff. That's where playing on a challenging environment will help you become a better builder, because it shows your build's weaknesses, be it low AB, lack of versatility, low AC or poor damage. You'll struggle in some department with nearly all builds, but you need to be exposed to the opportunities to detect them.<br/>\n<br/>\n @CT.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Much better, only thing I can suggest is swap Toughness or Improved Expertise for Blind Fight. Probably Improved Expertise.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I have a Wizard 29 / PM 10 / Assassin 1 who has 43 AB with Tenser's Transformation, which would make him hit Mephistopheles on all 5 attacks on anything but a 1.

With the whole jump back to the top of the balcony, get summoned down, hurt him a little more, get to the second part, kill lava monsters, etc... It was like I was transported back from Neverwinter Nights into Megaman X. If you've never played it, each boss in Megaman X had a weakness, so there was kind of a routine that you needed to do to kill them (attack, then when he charges at you, jump, grab the wall, rinse and repeat). I thought that was really underwhelming. If I had wanted to play Megaman I would play Megaman! This is Neverwinter Nights, dammit! <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Lost my save file at some point and could never work up the energy to get back to it. From what I understand, the story of BG is great, but it takes a while for it to really get going, at least in my opinion. I really need to give it a try again at some point, but seeing as its exam season here, I might need to put it off for a little while...<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

NwN 1 was the last of that great period or something like that, with the sole exception of the first Dragon Age Origins no other RPG today have their charm/ appeal/ durability in time. Or else we would play something else than NwN 1 after 12 years i guess. Now it is only silly mmo's with fetch quests by the hundreds and static combat and cartoon like monsters, bah!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
