      "content": "<div>Hi all!<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought I would try my hand at trying to create a devastating critical cleric / pale master build.<br/>\n<br/>\nThought it would be time to try another build on WoG soon, I'm stuck at Rary's place and can't progress further which is a little frustrating. I think I have the right key (it says it unlocks the main tower) but it seems to not work.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway whilst I'm thinking about what to how to progress time to make some plans and get help from those who know better!<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought I should choose a strong class (cleric) with a strong feat (devastating critical), and add pale master build for me to learn the class.<br/>\n<br/>\nRDD is probably easier and stronger with better stats but what the heck, learning is the goal here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSources of inspiration:<br/>\nMaximillan Kane's The Dark Orcish Shaman (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-dark-orcish-shaman-cleric-20-bard-4-pm-16-t2335357.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the-dark-orcish-shaman-cleric-20-bard-4 ... 35357.html</a>)<br/>\nMithradates Hierophant of Velsharoon (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build247143.html#page1\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/buil ... html#page1</a>)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing a bit pale and sickly looking unfortunately his constitution isn't the greatest but this can be buffed up with a endurance spell or items. I think Avado wrote that would be ok, somewhere in his legacy ECB forum posts (risking his divine wrath right now if I'm wrong). He also wrote Wis 19 would be ok<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to make the most of the bard class skills with skill dumps so I didn't want to weaken int too much. I could have ditched discipline as a skill but the thought of being disarmed made me pause.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think UMD 20 is enough to use all scrolls as a bard without chance of arcane failure, but correct me if I'm wrong<br/>\n<br/>\nI like undispellable buffs. On WoG every second monster casts greater dispelling on you at least twice every battle.

That was super fast!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll drop kukri for scimitar.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI chose kukri because of the crit range and I had a choice between exotic and martial I guess! Exotic sounds more... well.. exotic...<br/>\n<br/>\nTrouble is the exotic weapon feat ranged weapons seem average, like its pretty much just shurikens it seems and 1d3 is pretty unimpressive, and I think I would rather have access to a mighty longbow of some sort.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was a scimitar of speed I picked up along my journey so there are definitely good scimitars out there, and true, there aren't that many great kukri's<br/>\n<br/>\nI started with Str 18 to try to get Dev Crit asap (like at level 30) but dropping the str does make the character stronger at level 40. Level 33 for dev crit is not too long to wait. I put the spare point into cons in case of a odd endurance spell roll.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway that was super great of you to comment.

Those extra 43 skill points could be really helpful in maxing everything you already take and maybe give a smattering in something else.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, and while I fully concur with Empyre and Valerfor as far as scimitar is concerned, it's a judgement call whether to take Martial Weapon Proficiency rather than sticking with the Cleric weapon choices, then taking Knockdown instead (who'd have thunk I'd ever make that suggestion?). <br/>\n<br/>\nJust thoughts...<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Ninja'd - again!</div>",

I liked Mick's Dev Crit Cleric/Monk/CoT, if this is the build you were wondering about Stag (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/dev-crit-cleric-t2354618-s10.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dev-crit-cleric-t2354618-s10.html</a>)<br/>\n<br/>\nEmpyre's suggestion is not bad. To use dagger to get another feat. Mithradates did that with his dev crit cleric/bard/pm build. If I want a two handed bludgeoning weapon I could always grab a quarterstaff plus cast a few spells from the charges inside them if its magical.\u00a0There are great feats I could get in exchange for sure.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI think though I'd like to stick with scimitars for the extra 5% crit threat range (10% if keen) compared with daggers. It's like a 5% - 10% increased chance of enemy death per hit, and with 4 attacks per round with a sky high threat roll from cleric buffs... well you get the picture. Can also use UMD to cast Keen Edge from a scroll on a scimitar which one probably can't with a dagger (has to be intrinsic to the dagger). Martial weapon proficiency gives me access to a whole bunch of great weapons like heavy flail if they are crit immune plus bows which is good (I'm kind of underwhelmed by the damage dealt by slings). Should be able to hit them with the silly cleric AB buffs this character will have access to even I don't have a weapon focus in the weapon in question.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Edit:</strong>\u00a0Whoops got the maths wrong. It's a 10% increased crit threat range (with improved critical) scimitar (15-20) vs dagger (17-20), 15% increased crit range if keened scimitar (12-20) vs dagger (15-20)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Edit 2:</strong> forgot to respond to Stag RE int 14 vs 12. I thought about it, I love skill points. Avado was an advocate for keeping cons low in cleric builds (like he says no higher than 10!). Trouble is this dude is gonna want to front line, and 300 odd HP is not a huge amount right now with Cons 12.\u00a0 I want to think about it a bit more and get back to you. bit of pondering. Avado might be right, who knows?</div>"

I haven't played in a lot of high magic environments where a game of 20s is extremely common and I do very much value your experience.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is from the wiki (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Threat_roll\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Threat_roll</a>):<br/>\n<blockquote><div>Since 20s do not automatically hit for a threat roll, a critical hit cannot be scored against an opponent whose\u00a0armor class(AC) exceeds an attacker's\u00a0attack bonus\u00a0by more than 20.</div></blockquote>\nThey haven't quoted any sources and there is no talk section so I felt very unsure about this advice.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I game tested this. Hope that is ok.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nMy intention is to try to find the truth of the mechanics not to prove the wiki right or wrong etc etc... (This is a dangerous tendency by the way: the saying 'curiosity killed the cat' is one example, and the house arrest / trial for heresy of Galileo Galilei for supporting heliocentrism - the idea the earth orbits the sun - thankfully the NWN Wiki probably doesn't have the power of the papacy, the ECB on the other hand... *gulp* why am I doing this...)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Pretty good character creator module:\u00a0</strong><br/>\nThis is a dragon with an artificially boosted AC to 100 from sources of natural AC (5), Dexterity (19), Dodge (20 from dragon shape), Deflection (20 - from +20\u00a0armor then transferred with druid polymorphing), Innate (10), Tumble (8), Monk wisdom AC (18).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nHe has uncanny dodge, but has to keep hitting opponents, otherwise his AC will drop to 74 (loss of Dodge and Tumble AC - correct me if I'm wrong).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nHis opponents will gain +2 AB from flanking. (if my understanding of the mechanics is correct - it is a total black box to me sometimes!)<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/201907/10759084_c6a31fc077acdbddc207b3a2e642e54d_t.jpg\"/><br/>\nSpawn 50 million gazillion level 40 fighters with devastating critical:<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/201907/10759084_14a0e7231303f2ea7fa7cdc78263ec19_t.jpg\"/><br/>\nCheck the combat logs for anything interesting:<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are the double 20 rolls I got, they are super rare. I got two double 20 non-critical hits. Perhaps I missed a few more, there were a lot of attacks going on.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI also got one non 20 devastating critical hit event when I didn't have dodge and tumble AC active.<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/201907/10759084_6cabc5537798186ba32880b95f6adac8_t.jpg\"/><br/>\nThat last devastating critical roll doesn't quite make sense to me. Maybe the AC drops further in other ways when flatfooted. Maybe someone else can point out something I've missed. Or assume its part of the black box of NWN mechanics - too complex, too hard to understand.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway AC being able to create immunity against critical hits even with double 20s, <em>based on one experiment</em>, I think the wiki is correct in an extremely high AC can create immunity to critical hits can occur, but one has to watch out for being flatfooted (ie drinking potions or knockdown, stun etc) otherwise Dodge, Dexterity (if no uncanny dodge) and Tumble AC will become inactive and the AC will drop and one will become susceptible to criticals.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Addit:</strong>\u00a0agree Val - no space to move with the feats. Reliant on constitution buffs to get that HP up too! It is a fair price to play in terms of balance for having both the cleric class, devastating critical and the palemaster class. Anyway my view - I am an intermediate level player, I need a crutch to succeed in a challenging persistent world, make the most powerful build I can think of, then build batman or other cool builds once I know what I'm doing :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Edit: </strong>Valerfor pointed out the -2AC penalty for huge size which I missed, so everything checks out. The Dragon's true AC is actually 98, not 100.</div>"

      "content": "<div>By the way I am going to use Stag's suggestion to put Int to 14. This guy needs skill points to solo effectively, for example I would want a search score up to about 10+, and one point in open lock. Listen is valuable against stealthy opponents. Going to edit the main post again soon. I think with a Cons of 9, I can boost it up with spells and equipment so I can manage that issue in that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy last decision is going to have to be regarding choice of deity which on WoG affects the domains I can use.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI would prefer Trickery and Travel but that is limited on WoG to Sehanine Moonbow which requires one to be a half-elf or elf. If I take half elf I get +1 to search listen spot, sleep immunity and +2 to saves against mind affecting abilities at the expense of one feat. I am super feat starved so that is unattractive.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrickery I think is too good to pass up for improved invisibility +50% concealment.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther deities with trickery + human are:<br/>\n<br/>\nBoccob, God of Magic<br/>\nAlignments:true neutral, chaotic neutral, lawful neutral, neutral evil, neutral good<br/>\nDomains:knowledge, magic, trickery<br/>\n<br/>\nErythnul, God of Slaughter<br/>\nAlignments:chaotic evil, chaotic neutral, neutral evil<br/>\nDomains:chaos, evil, trickery, war<br/>\n<br/>\nIuz, Old Wicked<br/>\nAlignments:chaotic evil<br/>\nDomains:chaos, evil, trickery<br/>\n<br/>\nNerull, God of Death<br/>\nAlignments:neutral evil, chaotic evil, lawful evil<br/>\nDomains:death, evil, trickery<br/>\nRaces:elf, half-elf, human<br/>\nTemple:Dark Arrow Forest<br/>\n<br/>\nOlidammara, God of Rogues<br/>\nAlignments:chaotic neutral, chaotic good, chaotic evil<br/>\nDomains:chaos, luck, protection, trickery<br/>\n<br/>\nRalishaz, Bringer of Misfortune<br/>\nAlignments:chaotic neutral, chaotic evil, chaotic good<br/>\nDomains:chaos, destruction, luck, trickery<br/>\n<br/>\nTiamat, Queen of Evil Dragons<br/>\nAlignments:lawful evil, neutral evil<br/>\nDomains:destruction, evil, law, trickery<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich means I choose between knowledge, magic, chaos, evil, war, luck, protection, destruction and law.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the non-standard domains Chaos grants color spray, confusion and sphere of chaos. Law grants charm person, dominate person and lesser mind blank. Luck grants charm person, bestow curse and sphere of chaos.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nOf the NWN domains I think War is best for Cat's Grace and Aura of Vitality (which can be extended hurray!) or Destruction for the ability to use turn undead to also damage constructs (40d3 sounds very strong!).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think Law would be best for the mind immunity spell, although Sphere of Chaos sounds amazing if its similar to the Baldurs Gate version.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway going to ponder this for a while before I decide. Maybe I will stick a post on the WoG forum for advice too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks everyone so much for reading this and for comments</div>"
