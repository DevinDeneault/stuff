Every other paladin build I\u2019ve made requires too many battle wards before it\u2019s useful. A good bodyguard build meant to have good ac, and good damage would be nice. But nobody can have their cake and eat it too, open to any suggestions for paladin or COT please help!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

And your final build has to have at least 3 levels in any class you use, so no new class at level 29 or 30 and no single monk-cheese level at all.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
