      "content": "<div>Hi Thorsson! I like the principle (and as everyone knows I love me some monk), but have a couple of possible tweaks - if you don't mind?<br/>\n<br/>\nI noticed that Blind Fight is sadly lacking (that's the big problem with the number of feats required for WM and effective 2-weapon fighting), so wondered how that might be resolved. If you change your starting stats slightly, to start with STR 15 and drop 2 points from either WIS or CON (I know, both have drawbacks), you could drop one of the Great Strength feats in epic levels - thereby enabling you to take EWF as a general feat - and then putting 2 (or even 3) more Fighter levels in pre-epic, Blind Fight then becomes available. You can decide whether it's worth it, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the skills side, I might be tempted to sacrifice either Heal or Lore (or a bit of each) to grab 18(20) cross-classed Spellcraft points for +4 saves vs spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's good to see some of us still actually building!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

      "content": "<div>I'm trying this in the Campaigns, which I haven't played since 2004. I couldn't recall Blind Fight being a necessity, but then after 14+ years my memory is very hazy. You're right, there's not too much you can give up to get it - most of the Feats are necessary. I'd probably give up Con I think, but that's too late now. Might drop a couple of GStr and also take Armor Skin - the AC is a bit low for my liking.<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably should give up some Lore and Healing, as you say. I wasn't sure how much I needed full Listen either, took it out of habit really.</div>"

      "content": "<div>You make a very fair point about the original campaigns as far as Blind Fight and Listen are concerned. However, as the OC will only get you to level 17/18 and the 2 expansions will get you about 28, you might want to think about Mines of Twin Summit after the OC, which will take you through to 40 with lots of breathing space. Equally, after SoU/HotU you could do worse than Sands of Fate - again taking you to level 40. In both of those arenas you might well find the feat and skill much more helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd my bad - I'd lost sight of Armor Skin. If you wanted to drop 2 GStrengths, of course, and assuming you wanted to keep the same strength level at the end, you'd have to drop both Con and Wis by 2 at the start (so losing 40hps and 1 AC - assuming you'll be in robes once Monk kicks into gear - which at least AS will more than compensate for).<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",
