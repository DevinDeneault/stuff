      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I quite agree. Pre-epic would have been my choice as well to expand the feat potential.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Like I said, it was a burp using the CBC that forced me to explore the sequence at that point differently in your posted build.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n I am quite confident that should you use CoT to grab EWS from any weapon proficiency at all there's no reason it wouldn't work. That's what is set in the feat.2da. But rather than confirm the feat selection using my trainer, I am interested to find whether the anomaly expressed in (what I assume is) the latest version of the CBC can be verified by other users of Kamiryn's spreadsheet. It's possible the conversion from .xlsx to .xls format corrupted some functionality of which I am not aware (I don't like running the MSOffice 2007 version of CBC so converted it).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
