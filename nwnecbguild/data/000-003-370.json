      "content": "<div>Seeing as my last (and first) build attempt was pretty horrible, I figured I should try to redeem myself. <br/>\nI have a couple all-time favorite builds and one of them is TyrTemplar's Sorcerer King: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build272583.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 72583.html</a>. This build is great and I've used it to stomp around on my usual PW, however I found it lacking once it reached level 40 content and beyond. It has great AC, but it lacks in AB. I tend to think of that build as a more defensive (tank) build, with it's high AC and PM Immunities. I wanted to create an offensive (hitting) version of the build. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat led to this build. I did a search and was very surprised that only one other build used this level spread, LuckyLion's Black Dragon: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build217781.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 17781.html</a>. <br/>\nThis build differs in that it doesn't go for Dev. Crit. (which I am not a fan of really), so generally feat selection and level splits are a bit different. <br/>\n<blockquote><div>Sorcerer(26), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Blackguard(4), Human<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 16 (26)<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 14 (16)<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 12 (14)<br/>\nCHA: 16 (30)<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Sorcerer(1): Power Attack, Cleave<br/>\n02: Sorcerer(2)<br/>\n03: Sorcerer(3): Extend Spell<br/>\n04: Sorcerer(4): CHA+1, (CHA=17)<br/>\n05: Sorcerer(5)<br/>\n06: Sorcerer(6): Still Spell<br/>\n07: Red Dragon Disciple(1)<br/>\n08: Red Dragon Disciple(2): CHA+1, (STR=18), (CHA=18)<br/>\n09: Red Dragon Disciple(3): Blind Fight<br/>\n10: Red Dragon Disciple(4): (STR=20)<br/>\n11: Sorcerer(7)<br/>\n12: Sorcerer(8): CHA+1, Empower Spell, (CHA=19)<br/>\n13: Sorcerer(9)<br/>\n14: Blackguard(1)<br/>\n15: Blackguard(2): *Weapon Focus*, {Smite Good}<br/>\n16: Red Dragon Disciple(5): CHA+1, (CHA=20)<br/>\n17: Red Dragon Disciple(6)<br/>\n18: Blackguard(3): Divine Shield<br/>\n19: Red Dragon Disciple(7): (CON=16)<br/>\n20: Sorcerer(10): CHA+1, (CHA=21)<br/>\n21: Sorcerer(11): Great Strength I, (STR=21)<br/>\n22: Sorcerer(12)<br/>\n23: Red Dragon Disciple(8)<br/>\n24: Red Dragon Disciple(9): CHA+1, *Epic Weapon Focus*, (INT=14), (CHA=22)<br/>\n25: Sorcerer(13)<br/>\n26: Sorcerer(14)<br/>\n27: Sorcerer(15): Great Strength II, (STR=22)<br/>\n28: Sorcerer(16): CHA+1, (CHA=23)<br/>\n29: Sorcerer(17)<br/>\n30: Sorcerer(18): Automatic Still Spell I<br/>\n31: Sorcerer(19)<br/>\n32: Red Dragon Disciple(10): CHA+1, {Darkvision}, (STR=26), (CHA=26)<br/>\n33: Sorcerer(20): Automatic Still Spell II<br/>\n34: Sorcerer(21)<br/>\n35: Sorcerer(22)<br/>\n36: Sorcerer(23): CHA+1, Automatic Still Spell III, Epic Spell: Epic Warding, (CHA=27)<br/>\n37: Sorcerer(24)<br/>\n38: Sorcerer(25)<br/>\n39: Sorcerer(26): Great Charisma I, Great Charisma II, (CHA=29)<br/>\n40: Blackguard(4): CHA+1, (CHA=30)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 348<br/>\nSkillpoints: 188<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 34/32/25<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8<br/>\nBAB: 23<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 34 (melee), 22 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 17/28<br/>\nSpell Casting: Sorcerer(9)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nConcentration 43(46), Discipline 43(51), Hide 5(4), Lore 8(10), Search 1(3), Spellcraft 42(44), Tumble 20(19)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Concentration(4), Lore(4), Spellcraft(4), Tumble(2), <br/>\n02: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(1), <br/>\n03: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), <br/>\n04: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(1), <br/>\n05: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), <br/>\n06: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(2), <br/>\n07: Hide(3), <br/>\n08: Hide(2), <br/>\n09: Tumble(2), <br/>\n10: Discipline(4), <br/>\n11: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), <br/>\n12: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(2), <br/>\n13: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), <br/>\n14: Discipline(4), <br/>\n15: Discipline(4), <br/>\n16: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(2), <br/>\n17: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(2), <br/>\n18: Discipline(4), <br/>\n19: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(2), <br/>\n20: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(2), <br/>\n21: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(2), <br/>\n22: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(2), <br/>\n23: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), <br/>\n24: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), <br/>\n25: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(1), <br/>\n26: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(2), <br/>\n27: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(1), <br/>\n28: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(2), <br/>\n29: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(3), <br/>\n30: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(6), <br/>\n31: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(7), <br/>\n32: Discipline(12), <br/>\n33: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(2), Save(1), <br/>\n34: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(2), <br/>\n35: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(3), <br/>\n36: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(6), <br/>\n37: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(7), <br/>\n38: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(10), <br/>\n39: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(13), <br/>\n40: Concentration(1), Discipline(15), Search(1), \n</div></blockquote>\n\nFully buffed and Tensered this build seems to attain a nicer AB while retaining a decent AC. I struggled with level splits as I wanted to attain Automatic Still Spell feats as soon as possible, but I also wanted the highest BAB possible pre-epic. I found this to really just be a trade-off. I opted for more BAB pre-epic and Autostill later. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I remain uncertain on is the Weapon Focus and Epic Weapon Focus. At first I wanted this build to use sword and board giving it the utility of being able to use any good one-handed weapon it found as it went along, as well as a higher AC of course. In the end I had a couple feat options so I went with a WF/EWF in a 2H Weapon. This of course hurts the AC a little. Anyone have opinions/suggestions on this? <br/>\n<br/>\nAll around I think this was a better attempt for my second build post, but I would love suggestions on improving this. <br/>\nThanks for looking!</div>"

That improves your # of spellslots, your spells DC, your saves and your DS based AC. But it does nothing for your AB and your spell penetration!<br/>\n<br/>\nAB +34 is better than the Sorcerer king, but is still going to miss a lot. The Black Dragon build has an AB of +38. <br/>\n<br/>\nWith only 26 caster levels and no spell penetration feats, your spells will miss creatures equipped with standard epic SR items (SR 32) 25% of the time. <br/>\nYou can lower SR with the Breach line of spells, and your build will often depend on them.</div>",

      "content": "<div>I'm currently playing a level 38 \"Sorcerer King\" build on my PW and it is quite an effective spell slinger. It only attains 2 more Charisma points than this build, and a Spell Focus/GsF/ESF in Necromancy (which I elected not to take, and replaced with other feats). I don't seem to have run into these problems you have pointed out when casting offensively...yet. <br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless, I was going for a more offensive (hitter) build, so I can see that I did invest too heavily in Charisma. The main allure of Charisma for me in this build was not for spell casting effectiveness but for a nice AC from Divine Shield for melee and tanking purposes. I see your point and I think some adjustments of Charisma points to Strength are in order.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT:<br/>\nI've made some adjustments to more heavily favor Strength and improve the AB a bit. Another option I was considering was to drop a couple Sorcerer levels for more Blackguard levels, but I'm not sure. <br/>\nDo you think this improves the build?

      "content": "<div>Hey man!<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree with Mick. Just as a reference, let me point you to my latest build, which uses Wizard instead of Sorcerer to combo with RDD and Bard to have access to UMD scrolls and items.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/draconic-arcanist-wizard-26-bard-4-rdd-10-t2344104.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Draconic Arcanist</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, IMO this hybrid type of build doesn't need to focus on the casting stat above reaching 19 to cast lvl 9 spells or 20 to get +1 modifier and a couple of spells per day (ending on an odd value makes me nervous). So I'd definitely invest in STR and stop CHA at 20 at the most, maybe even 19 if you're tight on feats and don't mind the odd score. Don't forget you can use items to enhance your CHA, which will give you +12 (+6 modifier), so +11 Dodge AC for 11 rounds of Divine Shield and 14 uses a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd like to see Epic Mage armor in this build, even though you can cap Dodge AC with DS (provided you keep CHA that high). You'll be able to equip a Full Plate +0 with a Strength bonus (if those are available) and still get +5 Armor from EMA (which isn't dispellable). +4 Haste, +5 EMA and +11 Divine Shield caps your Dodge AC too.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

      "content": "<div>At one point while putting this together I did have Epic Mage Armor, but somewhere along the way, shuffling classes around, I lost it. On my PW I believe (not 100% off the top of my head), that EMA has been modified to add something like +5 Dodge AC and +1 AC for each other armor type (Natural, Deflection, etc.). I've found with a high Divine Shield on my \"Sorcerer King\" build this negates a large chunk of the benefits from EMA, however with the modification it still is useful. More AC is always a good thing after all. So I tend to opt for Epic Warding first, but EMA is a close second. I will definitely squeeze it in if I can. <br/>\n<br/>\nI am contemplating dropping some Sorcerer levels to help the AB at this point. It's starting to look more like the Sorcerer spells are going to be primarily used for buffing anyway. I'm still unsure however.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm kind of a perfectionist/mildly OCD, so I too get a little weird about a ability/stat/level landing on an odd number.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Interesting build idea. I guess the question that pops into my head right away is, why blackguard? Is it for Divine Shield and saves? It seems that may be the biggest benefit you are getting from that class. If the goal of this build is more substantial hitting power, then you might consider four levels of fighter, which will net you much-needed bonus feats (possibly with Expertise to replace DS) and access to Weapon Specialization. Sticking with BG, the offensive feat that would help the build most might be Divine Might. That extra divine damage will come in handy when encountering tough epic creatures with spell resistance/immunity.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway,  the reason I mention fighter is that most CHA-based spellsword builds suffer from feat starvation, and this one is no exception. The natural answer for that is the fighter class, which gives 3 feats in four levels. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of the day, it depends what you want the toon to be best at. If he is to primarily be a caster and the melee abilities are there for taking down mobs and tanking for parties that don't have another tank while saving the better spells to nuke bosses and high-AC opponents, then this approach of not worrying much about AB and taking that nice saving throw bonus can get that job done. If the goal is that he primarily be a melee toon with access to all the nice mage buffs, then I would really consider taking many more full AB levels pre-epic (like 8 levels if you are want epic spells EW and EMA or 10 levels otherwise), only raising CHA to 19 or 20 (going STR instead), and choosing fighter as the full-AB class so that you can get the feats and weapon specialization you will need to hit and damage the tougher opponents in melee.</div>"

      "content": "<div>I choose Blackguard for a few reasons. First, it's just my favorite class. Most of the builds I play involve BG in some way. I also really like the synergy of mixing it with other Charisma based classes, like Sorcerer, and RDD only improves upon this with it's ridiculous ability bonuses. I really like the added versatility of Divine Shield (and sometimes Divine Might) as well as the boost to saving throws. I've always been a fan of Divine Shield over Divine Might. I personally think that the AC benefit is far better than a damage buff. I would rather survive longer in a fight, even though I would be dealing out less damage per hit. I don't mind Divine Might, but it's really the 2nd best of the two in my opinion. That being said I could see taking Divine Might in this build after Divine Shield by dropping a couple Sorcerer levels and adding a couple BG levels (probably pre-epic for that AB bonus).<br/>\n<br/>\nI fully understand the allure of even 4 levels of Fighter, effectively netting WS and EWS. However, with Sorcerer levels and RDD levels, going with Fighter and not BG to take advantage of Charisma seems wrong. I would build something completely different if I wanted to include Fighter levels (say, a Ftr/Bard/RDD).</div>"
