      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">I have two character concepts in mind: One is a samurai focused around the katana, must be human, and good for PvP on a level 20 server. The idea behind the samurai would be a mid-to-high AC character with, hopefully, a high crit range. Shields are a no-no.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other is a Paladin (or a fighter, unsure), using either or a greatsword or a scythe, also must excel at PvP on a level 20 server. The idea behind a paladin would be to do as much damage per swing as possible, with little regards to AC. Hit them harder and faster than they can hit you.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hail,<br/>\n<br/>\nFor your first idea, if you don't want a shield but DO want a Katana, there is NO WAY you'll have a high AC. Period. Katana cannot be finessed, which means you'll need to be a STR toon, which means you'll have low AC and that is even more true if you're giving up a shield. So the first idea you have is just impossible. No shield on a STR toon means low AC, and that's just what it is. That said, I'm thinking a STR-based Fighter 16 Rogue 3 Shadowdancer 1. He would have Hide in Plain Sight, which would be his way of defending himself (Hiding and striking again), although hiding is more Ninja stuff than Samurai, but, that's just NWN mechanics. If you don't agree with the SD (which I think is highly probable), you can make a Fighter 10 Rogue 3 Weapon Master 7 for more critical hits. Pretty straightforward. but still a low AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the second, I'd suggest a Pal WM COT, but that needs more than 20 levels to be useful. For pre-epic damage, a Scythe-wielding-STR-based Cleric would be the ultimate destroyer. Maybe something like Cleric 15 Fighter 4 Assassin 1. You'd have the chance of paralyzing your opponent in the first hit, although very mild (probably only on a 1 roll), could use invisibility by picking the Trickery domain to approach the unsuspecting, and KD them. The reason I say Cleric is because they have Darkfire, Divine Favor and could even pick up Divine Might. Those 3 combined are just too much damage when added to a scythe. However, you'd be very tight on feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I think both could be Fighter 12 / Monk 1 / Weapon master 7, taking Monk at level 17 for a tumble skill-dump and free Cleave. Alternatively, you could take Bard instead of Monk to get a skill-dump in Spellcraft as well as Tumble. It depends on whether you want to be Lawful or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nNinja'd, but I decided to post my simple suggestion anyway.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I'm trying to build around a character concept.<br/>\n<br/>\n The concept being a Paladin that is constantly on the verge of falling, or perhaps has already fallen. So something fighter or paladin-based, with a 13-15th century flair in the style of the doppelsoldners or landschnecht (the soldiers how became famous for wielding greatswords). I also want the character to be powerful in PvP and viable in PvM.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second idea is for a ronin samurai, hence the katanas. Would like them to be viable in PvP and PvM, with a few tricks up the sleeve. I was thinking maybe fighter levels, or it could even be monk levels. But, being a samurai, katana, greatsword, or (pushing it) halberd has to be the weapon of choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nA final idea is your ninja. Monk/Rogue/Fighter or fighter/rogue/sd? with aim for dual-wielding kama. Not sure. Helpz?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Here's what I came up with. the two builds are almost identical. With the samurai, I opted for the greatsword, which you could roleplay is a dai katana, and went with Monk for the Tumble skill-dump because unlike ninjas, samurai were more lawful, and also, Monk fits the oriental theme. For the knight, I went with Bard to better fit the idea of a fallen paladin, non-lawful.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe somebody else will come along and suggest better feats then the ones I took near the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nSamurai:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tSpoiler<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t[+]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\tLevel 20 Samurai (Fighter 12 / Weapon Master 7 / Monk 1)<br/>\nHuman, Any Lawful<br/>\nPlayable 1 -

Spend 16 of those 23 points on Spellcraft, giving 8 ranks and then +2 from the 14 INT makes 10, giving you +2 on saves against spells, and leaving you with 7 skill points to spend wherever you want.<br/>\nThis would be the samurai build.
