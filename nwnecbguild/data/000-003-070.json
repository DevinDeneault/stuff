But the undead lord was one of the spotlight builds, so wasnt listed there.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikispaces.com/undead_lord\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwn.wikispaces.com/undead_lord</a><br/>\n<br/>\n The Undead Lord was a Wizard/Ftr/Palemaster with a 6/4/30 level split. \u00a0He was a scimitar wielding, epic spell casting, dev critting AC tank. \u00a0The 30 PM levels gave a whopping +16 to AC<br/>\n<br/>\n If you were to try and remake one of these nowadays, what would you change from the original linked above? \u00a0And yes I know... \u00a0 you can always drop the PM levels and take more wizard or fighter.. but then you dont get to run around with a Demi-Lich as a pet. \u00a0And who hasnt always wanted a disembodied head with glowing eyes following you around like a lost puppy dog?<br/>\n<br/>\n And I have a question for the rules experts concerning the original.<br/>\n<br/>\n The original took all three of the spell penetration feats, but since Bioware borked up the caster levels for Palemasters, does this do any real good? \u00a0The effective caster level is 6 due to the 6 wizard levels and Epic Spell Penetration only gives a +6 to spell DC. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Wouldnt it be better to use those three feats for something like IKD and maybe craft wand?<br/>\n<br/>\n Conlaoch<br/>\n<br/>\n [edited to fix my atrocious spelling and typing]<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

But then you'll be even more pressed feat-wise.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

A decoy's job is to aggro the monsters (draw their attention) so the casters and archers can do the damage. This would be a pain to solo, taking forever to kill the monsters, relying on natural 20s to hit, and hoping that you get that natural 20 before they do.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

IDK if they count to beating Spell Resistance. Logic would say no, but I've never actually tested. Hip was spot on as to the SR check. Imagine this: 6 Caster Levels + 6 from ESP feats = 12, so for penetrating Spell Resistance. That means you WON'T penetrate anything. If PM levels work, then it's as though you were a level 27 caster. Still pretty crappy if you ask me. Another thing that PM levels don't count towards are spell durations, so your spells will last as long and be equivalent to a level 6 Wizard. That's also crappy.<br/>\n<br/>\n And what do you get for so many PM levels? Epic Spells, a Demi Lich summon (meh) and LOADS of AC so you can have a lifetime of \"only hit on natural 20's\" duels with every foe you encounter. TBH I really dislike that build. If I were to rebuild this guy, it'd probably be something close to GDL's Charnel Lord. Now THAT is a build!<br/>\n<br/>\n That's just my 2 cents.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
