Does not have to be fully sorc but would like to focus on pure offensive spell casting. I would like to somehow mix in a level of shadow dancer for HIPS if it cannot facetank. Has to be an elf. Has to be evil. Server is a low magic server with +5 rare drops. Any help with this would be appreciated, thank you!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Again, I'm thinking Charisma synergy. However, it does seem mean to shove an elf into Sorcerer rather than Wizard, regardless of alignment<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
