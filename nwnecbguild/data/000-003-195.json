Anyway, that gave me the opportunity to take Mick's Hinn Rogue/CoT/Fighter for a run around, and that led to something of an epiphany. I'd never really played a Dex-based build before, but it was brilliant! (Thanks hugely, Mick) And that got me thinking...<br/>\n<br/>\n I've always been a Monk fan, and if I'm Dex-ing, some Rogue would seem a good idea. However, I'm still not great at sneaking, so I thought HiPS would help. I'm also rubbish at evil (in the game, anyway), so that leaves me with Shadow Dancer. I'm also thinking either Elf (cos they're the coolest) or Halfling (cos they're the cutest).<br/>\n<br/>\n So, a couple of questions to the great and good: first, does it sound like a decent combo? Second, is there anything out there aleady that looks something like it?<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks in advance. Hope everyone's well.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks, Empyre. I've had a look at all seven, and none of them seemed quite - me. So it looks like I'm going to have to build my own (drat - was trying to be lazy!). They have given me a good idea of decent splits and desirable feats, so very useful in that respect. Also, I may end up going human, or I risk a starting strength that would mean I could barely carry my own boots.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'll keep you posted when I've got something worth looking at (I hope), but I'll likely have some stupid questions before then!<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Well, made several dog's breakfasts out of this so far, so am now looking at something else. It's a mash up of three cracking builds, so I'll probably end up making a hideous mess, but I'm working from both your (Empyre) Order of the Red Wyrm builds (Unarmed and Kama) and the concept behind Valerfor's Dodgy Dominatrix (not her real name!). Now, given that I've now told you, I'd best make it acceptable, lest the wrath of two of the big boys drop upon me from a great height.<br/>\n<br/>\n Hope everyone's well!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
