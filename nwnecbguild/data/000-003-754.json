I've sacrificed 80 odd skill points in my build to be able to get one feat of EDR but I felt the build didn't need those points, and the extra HP is good to be able to survive when casting druidic spells of death with a small bonus to concentration as well. I wish I could have fit more EDR into the build but with DS wisdom requirements it was always going to be tough<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Druid(24), Monk(2), Dwarven Defender(14), Dwarf\nSTR: 8\nCON: 18 (21)\nINT: 10\n\n01: Druid(1): Toughness\n03: Druid(3): Extend Spell\n05: Druid(5)\n07: Druid(7)\n09: Druid(9): Dodge\n11: Dwarven Defender(1): {Defensive Stance}\n13: Dwarven Defender(3)\n15: Dwarven Defender(5): Improved Critical: Unarmed\n17: Dwarven Defender(7)\n19: Dwarven Defender(9)\n21: Druid(11): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=23)\n23: Druid(12)\n25: Druid(14)\n27: Druid(16): Great Wisdom III, (WIS=26)\n29: Druid(18)\n31: Druid(20)\n33: Druid(22): Great Wisdom V, (WIS=30)\n35: Druid(24): Dragon Shape\n37: Monk(2): {Deflect Arrows}\n39: Dwarven Defender(13): Epic Prowess\n\nSkillpoints: 144\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +2, Traps: +1, Poison: +2, Fear: +2\nAB (max, naked): 27 (melee), 38 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Druid(9)\n\n\n01: Animal Empathy(1), Concentration(4), Open Lock(1), Search(1), Save(7),\u00a0\n03: Concentration(1), Save(13),\u00a0\n05: Concentration(1), Save(19),\u00a0\n07: Concentration(1), Save(25),\u00a0\n09: Concentration(1), Save(31),\u00a0\n11: Concentration(1), Discipline(14), Save(21),\u00a0\n13: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Save(21),\u00a0\n15: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Save(21),\u00a0\n17: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Save(21),\u00a0\n19: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Save(21),\u00a0\n21: Concentration(1), Save(24),\u00a0\n23: Concentration(1), Search(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n25: Concentration(1), Search(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n27: Concentration(1), Search(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n29: Concentration(1), Save(7),\u00a0\n31: Concentration(1), Save(13),\u00a0\n33: Concentration(1), Save(19),\u00a0\n35: Concentration(1), Save(25),\u00a0\n37: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Tumble(15),\u00a0\n39: Concentration(1), Discipline(1),\u00a0</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
