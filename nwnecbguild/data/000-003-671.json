      "content": "<div>Greetings agmnthane!<br/>\n<br/>\nJust to summarise:<br/>\n- Ranger dual wielding build, human or elf, playable from level 1<br/>\n- No multiclass penalties<br/>\n- Single player, Bioware Original Campaign, Shadows of Undrentide and Hordes of the Underdark\u00a0<br/>\n-&gt; (ie: early power spikes preferable, <strong>level 28 maximum</strong>)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what I would consider playing, have a look and see if it suits your needs as well!<br/>\nIt can do 8-10 attacks / round with flurry and haste with dual Kamas, and has +10% monk speed, 2d6 sneak attack and extra damage from ranger favored enemies / bane of enemies added to each attack.<br/>\nIt can also set deadly traps, persuade NPCs to give you lots of rewards, tumble around combat doing whatever you want, and the attack bonus can be boosted from the dexterity bonuses from ranger<br/>\nI didn't put stealth in because I didn't want to make it too complex for you, but it is a reasonable choice to put that in as well with the great ranger stealth spells.\u00a0<br/>\nThe important thing is to make sure the character is Lawful alignment, otherwise you cannot take a Monk level and get all the goodness from it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has been a while since I have played the original campaign / bioware expansions.<br/>\nCan I get some suggestions on skill distribution and favored enemies? I remember humans and undead were a good choice, and outsiders later in the game.\u00a0<br/>\nOverall I feel this would be very fun to play but maybe some of the others in the forum have suggestions to make it even better<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Ranger(21), Rogue(4), Monk(3), Human\n\nDEX: 16 (24)\nWIS: 14\nCHA: 8\nHuman: (Quick to Master)\n02: Ranger(2)\n04: Ranger(3): DEX+1, (DEX=17)\n06: Ranger(5): Knockdown, Favored Enemy: Undeads\n08: Rogue(1): DEX+1, (DEX=18)\n10: Ranger(8)\n12: Ranger(10): DEX+1, Improved Critical: Kama, (DEX=19)\n14: Ranger(11)\n16: Ranger(13): DEX+1, (DEX=20)\n18: Ranger(14): Iron Will\n20: Rogue(3): DEX+1, {Uncanny Dodge I}, (DEX=21)\n22: Monk(3)\n24: Ranger(18): DEX+1, Great Dexterity I, (DEX=23)\n26: Ranger(20): Epic Prowess\n28: Rogue(4): DEX+1, (DEX=24)\n\nHitpoints: 286\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 21/18/23\nBAB: 22\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 25/27\nAlignment Changes: 0\nAnimal Empathy 1(0), Disable Trap 22(25), Discipline 30(32), Heal 8(10), Lore 9(10), Open Lock 14(21), Persuade 31(30), Search 9(10), Set Trap 6(15), Spot 11(13), Tumble 30(37), UMD 31(30)\n\n02: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Save(8),\u00a0\n04: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Search(2), Save(1),\u00a0\n06: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Save(8),\u00a0\n08: Disable Trap(2), Open Lock(1), Persuade(5), Tumble(5), UMD(10),\u00a0\n10: Discipline(1), Save(9),\u00a0\n12: Discipline(1), Save(19),\u00a0\n14: Discipline(2), Save(4),\u00a0\n16: Discipline(1), Save(9),\u00a0\n18: Discipline(1), Save(10),\u00a0\n20: Disable Trap(8), Open Lock(8), Persuade(1), UMD(8),\u00a0\n22: Discipline(1), Persuade(4), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n24: Discipline(1), Search(5),\u00a0\n26: Discipline(1), Save(10),\u00a0\n28: Disable Trap(6), Persuade(6), Tumble(5), UMD(8),\u00a0\n</details></div>"

      "content": "<div>Keep in mind, that it is strongly recommended to start a new character for SoU-HotU. If you start SoU with the character you finished OC the fixed encounters will be too easy, because they should pose a challenge for a much lower level character. Those fixed encounters are usually the bosses, and it is very disappointing if the general monsters before a boss are much more stronger than the boss itself. SoU and HotU are designed for a new character where SoU takes you from 1 to 12-13 and HotU from 15 to 28. This way you can try two different builds if you want, however the OC build will end around 16-17.</div>"
