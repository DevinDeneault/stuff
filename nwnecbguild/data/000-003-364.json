      "content": "<div>OK, let me just say a couple of things:<br/>\n<br/>\nAn unarmed Monk is completely different than a Kama Monk, because Unarmed requires at least 16 levels of Monk for maximum damage with the fists, which is lower for Halflings because of the small size. A Kama Monk can have as little as 2 levels and have pretty much the same effectiveness as a Monk with 20 levels except for not getting free IKD, and all the Monk immunities and speed bonus. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Blackguard, unfortunately, the class isn't of much use past 4 levels because everything it gives you can get better with other classes. But with 4 levels you can get Divine Might and Divine Shield, which gives you more damage and AC as long as you have Charisma. So are you looking to go heavy on BG for RP reasons or will 4 levels suffice?<br/>\n<br/>\nI could suggest a dex-based Monk BG SD wielding Kamas. Monk 9 SD 5 BG 16 would allow you to get Epic Dodge. You'd have HiPS to get away if things get ugly and a few Sneak Attack dice (and maybe an Epic Fiendish Servant to help generate sneaks) and full attack Schedule if you go Monk 8 SD 4 BG 8 pre-epic. Let me try to build this guy quickly, but let me tell you that this build wouldn't work unarmed because of the aforementioned need to have at least 16 Monk levels for maximum effectiveness.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

Wisdom 14 is because you get access to bonus spells that way on Amia. You can also pick Bastard sword or Katana for weapon focus if you want shield AC and the magical properties you can get on a shield.
