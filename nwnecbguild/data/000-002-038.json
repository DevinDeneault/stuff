I'll pull something together just for you, if you like - \"Con bash, Con smash!\"<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides which, I seem to recall us striking a deal a year or two ago in which you'd play a Cleric and I'd play an arcanist. I've done my bit (it worked, but I didn't like it. My own fault, having spouted off previously that I play everything I build), so I'm just waiting for you over the finish line.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd what gives with being kewl with Druids but not other divine casters? I thought I was the weird one...<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",
