      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">...include a drifting mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n I've recently been working through HotU with a view to having a \"proper\" go at Sands of Fate, when something struck me: if HoTU is Dev Crit enabled, is SoF? I don't think I've made a Dev Crit build - certainly not in the last 2 years, so thought I'd try. I also had the Ranger class on my mind thanks to another build request (thus, you can blame them for what follows <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT: </strong></em>Sorry again. I'm aware the AC is less than great, any thoughts there - that don't necessarily mean taking Heavy Armour?<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></em> I've just checked the Legacy Archive and Hip's fantabulous contrapulator and there don't seem to be any other builds of this design. Which would make it either \"interestingly unique\" or \"unlikely to succeed\". Votes? Oh, and given that I don't have a full repetroire of FEs, my thinking would be to go for those that are crit immune (Undead and Constructs are the first that come to mind), then those you're most likely to have a rotten time with in your environment (eg, Aberrations and Outsiders), before anything else (Reptilians, Giants, Elementals, Dwarves, Elves, whatever). Still, it's up to you. Oh, and regarding the skills, I'd have gone for some Hide and Move Silently if I was taking SD - just to cover me. They still might be a good idea, however, and are max-able if I drop Conc and Spellcraft. Again, over to you...<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT 3:</strong></em> Changed epic levels in light of the below, but maintained the drive for Dev Crit prior to BoE, which I'm still not sure about.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT 4:</strong></em> Another edit to take account of what I said in post #5, below.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Unfortunately, I can answer one of my own questions now. Somewhere in the recesses of my mind was a previous discussion, and alas it it is true. I was correctly informed by Hip that when levelling-up the sequencing runs: stat increase; skills; bonus feat; general feat. Thus, I am unable to take Overwhelming Crit at L21 and Devastating Crit at L24 (which were both CoT bonus feats, relying on taking the general Great Strengths first). Therefore, regardless of anything else, some shuffling is in order - and possibly pushes the acquiring of BoE forwards.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Well, I downloaded the Pretty Good Character Creator from the Vault, and it doesn't appear to be working for me (I stuck it in the mods folder - was this wrong?), so I'm taking this toon on a quick blast through the OC before taking Aribeth's Redemption (currently about to visit the Head Gaoler). I've also tweaked the build to change the order of pre-epic feats and altered the skillset: losing Concentration to boost Lore and taking Search up to 33 (modified to 34). The Search increase is specific to SoF, because I seem to recall someone mentioning that there were a lot of hidden doors/traps there and it would be handy to find them. Iirc, a modified 34 is the most you can use without having any Rogue in the build.so that's why I stopped there. That left 19 skill points going spare, so I stuck them into Lore, giving 25 (25), to help with funds. Am off to do the edit now...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
