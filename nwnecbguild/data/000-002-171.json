This particularly thought is not going to be news to the uber Druid players out there, and certainly not for Maximillan Kane, if he is still out there..., having read some of his famous posts... (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build316635.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/buil ... 16635.html</a>)<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm playing through World of Greyhawk Persistent World. Taking on one of the tougher areas, Critwall. Which I was advised not to go to unless I enjoyed running or taking a dirt nap. What the heck I want a challenge. Lets go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI break the Critwall Siege and go one area west. Solo Druid 17/Monk 1, with Knockdown / Spell Focus: Conjuration / Greater Spell Focus Conjuration.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm fighting two tough Bugbear Warriors. I cast Grease, turn into elemental shape. Fight in the Grease like a carnival mudpit. Or a Wild Pig in Mud. Happy times!<br/>\n<br/>\nThey simply cannot stand up to fight me for the whole duration of the spell!!! (7 rounds) No need to try to knockdown them down.. what's the mechanics here?<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>\n\n\nMaybe add +4 (Dex 18) for high reflex save types and +2 (Dex 14) for low reflex save types. Probably too generous here for the other types.\n-&gt; Reflex class save 16 Non reflex class save 8 vs DC 27</details>\n<br/>\nI think I have found my new favourite spell... I honestly thought as a shapechanger I would have to use the Knockdown feat .... no sir cast grease instead... Well if I run out of spells or shape changes I guess it might be useful...<br/>\n<br/>\n<span class=\"inline-attachment\">\n<dl class=\"fileimage display\">\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/201907/10759084_66d654d41ad9981892f449aae08b469e_t.jpg\" />\n</dl>\n</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Finger of Death looks very strong...</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nOk I'm working through this enemy outpost just to the southeast of the area I described. I whittle the enemy down one by one. But at the end there is this big bad Ogre Mage, who I struggle to defeat despite my efforts. His name is Satchamo.<br/>\n<br/>\nI cast all sorts of spells. Empowered Ice Storm. Storm of Vengance. Summon Creature 8. Call lightning. etc etc... Doesn't touch him.<br/>\nI try to hit him with my strongest forms. Monk bear and Monk Water Elemental tickle him.\u00a0<br/>\nRun away, rack my brain for a solution.<br/>\nLets try Finger of Death. I wait for his Death Ward buff to wear off (by returning to the area later). He dies instantly.\u00a0<br/>\nHappy days... the mechanics of it all?<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Finger of Death (Druid) DC: 10 + 8 (spell level) + 12 (wis modifier) = 30.\nProbable saving throw for high fortitude save Lvl 20 enemies: 12 (base) + 4 (assume Cons 18) = 16\n95% chance of death for non-high fortitude save enemies at Lvl 20</details>\nSeems super strong...<br/>\n<br/>\n<span class=\"inline-attachment\">\n<dl class=\"fileimage display\">\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/201907/10759084_4b83b7ea4df0b66c0b89e4c09eb3f613_t.jpg\" />\n</dl>\n</span><br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway hope you enjoyed this post!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Get some screenshots from your fight with Arbas, will ya (in WoG's thread)?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, FoD is really good on Druids, preach!<br/>\n<br/>\nTip: That hill, right there was/is the place of epic fights...The two boxes up there are both weapon focus chests.<br/>\nMore useful when you are melee of course.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
