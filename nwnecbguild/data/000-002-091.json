      "content": "<div>This might be a very dumb question, but I wondered whether there was a particular reason why there don't appear to be any Cleric/Ranger builds in either our database or the archive?<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least superficially there seems to be a synergy between the two classes - as far as Wisdom goes, anyway. And Cleric/Rangers were always reckoned to be an almost OP class in Baldur's and Icewind. Am I missing something obvious?<br/>\n<br/>\n(I realize this might be something of a spoiler for what I'm looking to do in my next build, but if it's a dead-end I'd rather know in advance.)<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

      "content": "<div>Cler38/Monk1/Rang1 is a fairly common PvP build, although I'm not sure if one has been posted on the ECB.<br/>\nA Rang/Cler/Monk with BoE (eg Rang23/Cler16/Monk1 or Rang26/Cler13/Monk1) can also have decent AB and damage, but due to the low level buffs they're much rarer than more reliable melee builds.<br/>\n<br/>\nOutside of those two build ideas I can't think of any cases where a Cler/Rang\u00a0is actually worth making.<br/>\nFor Cleric builds (and most builds in general really) it's almost always better to go Figh4 instead of Rang9 for dual-wielding feats, especially since caster levels are fairly important.<br/>\nOn the other hand, for Ranger builds you need a minimum of Rang21 for BoE and a minimum of 12-15 Cler levels before the buffs are even worth considering which seriously limits the number of viable builds.</div>"
