I understand your curiosity, but what would be the point of calculating the damage potential of DevCrit other that curiosity itself? The thing is that when DevCrit hits, it's over, combat ends instantly, so it's more like the opposite of damage, which until you reach 0 HP, means combat continues, and you can react. How do you quantify the fact that enemies can't heal against a DevCrit? How do you account for the damage the character who is DevCritted has already suffered before getting DevCritted? Because more likely than not, the enemy won't be at full HP when they do go down.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if you consider that formula, then DevCrit would do more damage against foes with higher HP, linking the damage not to the DevCrit itself, but to enemy HP. A similar way of thinking would apply if you tried to convert insta-death spells into Fireballs using that logic.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the idea, but I don't see the practical application of it, yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Basically, its like another<br/>\nattack roll made at weapon\u2019s threat range, similar to an attack roll with full base AB, but with no automatic failure when a 1 is rolled. If the roll plus the AB exceeds the enemy AC, the attack becomes a critical. To correct my computation above, A will land 11 hits in 20 rounds, not all, but only 2.2 of those are criticals. Dev crit chance would be a measly 0.22% of total attacks. My calculation for B would still be the same (45 out of 91 hits in 20 rounds will be criticals) Dev crit chance would be 100 times that of A\u2019s (22.5%)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

What do I mean by that? Simply that there is more chance of either very low or very high numbers than if you were rolling the dice yourself. And most of you can confirm with their senses that with either Baldur's Gate II or Neverwinter Nights, there are far more critical hits (or spectacular failures) than what the average numbers might say. <br/>\n<br/>\nI remember an article about Pools of Radiance back in the day, they were saying (amongst others) that the RNG of the game was a failure since it was producing average numbers most of the time &amp; low-level heroes (&amp; monsters) couldn't hit the broad side of a barn.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I don't know if I'm going completely on a tangent here, but basically speaking, +1 AB allows you to hit once more every 20 attacks.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, by that logic, you can say that it largely depends on how much damage you do per hit, being less effective for DEX toons than for STR toons, because the former would do little damage per hit, whereas the latter, with an extra hit, would do significantly more damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nEWS adds a fixed 4 to every hit you already make, so if you multiply the number of hits you have out of 20 (I.E. you hit 5x, on a 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20, some or all of which might end up being critical hits, doubling or tripling the damage). So you multiply it by 4 on normal hits, and by 8 or 12 on crits, multiplied by their specific chances to occur (the total of which needs to add up to 100%), and you'll have that average added damage, depending on several factors, such as: enemy AC, Weapon Multiplier, Weapon Crit Range, whether it's Keen or not, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nThen if that number you get is lower than the normal damage you do with a single regular attack, EP is better. If the number is higher, then EWS is better. Clearly, for DEX characters, EWS will likely be better than for STR ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's my reasoning, but I really don't want to do the calculations.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.: <em class=\"mention\">@darktooth</em>\u00a0if you want to quote me manually (instead of using the button underneath my post), type:<br/>\n<br/>\n\u00a0\"[ quote ] insert the bit you want to quote here, and then type [ / quote ]\" (remove all the spaces inbetween the brackets, slashes and quote(s), which I put there just so that you could see them instead of them turning whatever I wrote in the middle into a quote, like this:<br/>\n<blockquote><div>insert the bit you want to quote</div></blockquote>\n\nCheers!\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
