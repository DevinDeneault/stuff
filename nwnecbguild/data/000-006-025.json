target=\"_blank\">Mestil\u2019s Pale Emissary</a>,\u00a0which seems like two lifetimes ago.\u00a0 I took the same premise, but turned it upside down (<em>to be honest, I was attempting to make a viable Gnome warrior build, and everything kept leading me back to Wizard, sigh</em>).\u00a0 But after all is said and done, I can\u2019t help but think this could be a thing.\u00a0 Unlike the Pale Emissary, you make no pretense at being a true caster.\u00a0 But you still have a full compliment of Wizard Spells, undispellable, Epic Warding, Auto Silent III, Silenced, Empowered and Maximized IGMS, Immune to Crits, Dev Crits, Sneaks, Paralysis, 9/- DR.\u00a0 But the true coup d'etat is the nearly 1000 hit points he gets when buffed with Empowered Endurance and some minor Con-boosting items, and then another 1300 hit points from Epic Warding, and with Damage Shields dealing nearly 100 points of damage per successful hit!\u00a0 Drop this little bugger into a crowd and watch \u2018em pop!\u00a0 With an unbuffed Concentration at 66, no one will be able to Taunt or interrupt his castings, nor will anyone be able to Silence him.\u00a0 Ladies, I present to you a build that should be

There\u2019s certainly enough feats here to customize to your pleasure.\u00a0 For instance, one doesn\u2019t need Auto Silence feats, but I thought it was useful enough in a build like this.\u00a0 One could swap those for a Necromancy Spell Focus line, but it didn\u2019t seem worthy enough since there\u2019s no effort to increase your casting stat beyond 20 (Mestil\u2019s Pale Emissary does a better job with that by getting a 32 Intelligence). Likewise, one could take ESF: Discipline and SF: Discipline to mitigate Knockdowns, but if you have access to KD immunity then just grab that and save two feats.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nWhile he has a low reflex save, it matters not because he has so many hit points, and he can mitigate any damage with Energy Buffers and Protection from Elements.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nFort Save is quite good and you really only need to worry about Save vs. Death Spells.\u00a0 With a 41 save, he can probably whether most of those storms.\u00a0 <br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nAC is low, but it\u2019s supposed to be.\u00a0 The idea is to soak damage with Stoneskins, Prems, Epic Warding.\u00a0 But even if those wear off, your DR, Crit Immunity and high hit points should win you any day in combat.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nI considered Expertise/Improved Expertise taken during pre-epic to give you some situational AC when needed, but I pulled the plug on it at the last minute.\u00a0 I think one should be okay without it.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nFinally, after playtesting, I think this build should be illegal in every regard in all PWs.\u00a0 Nothing could withstand him in melee warm ups in the PGCC.\u00a0 Once I ran through the gamut (to include Prismatics), I then spawned 4 different Level 40 class builds at once (Ranger, WM, AA, and Monk) and they perished in short order, though I will give props to the Ranger for lasting the longest.\u00a0 Ranged types are a nuisance, and will be the subject of your Empowered IGMS.\u00a0 Other casters can be problematic, but you\u2019ll outlast them.\u00a0 Just keep your Spell Mantles up (perfect use for 7<sup>th</sup> level slots), and wear them down with your high Fort Save and unnaturally high hit points.\u00a0 You\u2019ll be able to crush them with a volley or two of some Ikes.\u00a0 Overall this is a very simple mage to play.\u00a0 Spellbook management is easy, because you have your bread butter \u2013 Death Armor, Elemental Shield, Acid Sheath \u2013 followed by your normal buffs, Stone Skins, Freedom, Greater Stone Skins, Prems, Shadow Shields, Spell Mantles, Time Stop, Mords, a Greater Sanc, and a retinue each of normal Ikes, Empowered Ikes, and Maximized Ikes.\u00a0 You have Craft Wand to make whatever you need (Invis, Improved Invis, ILMS, Stoneskin, Bulls, Find Traps, etc.).\u00a0 You can scribe Time Stop Scrolls, Greater Sanc scrolls, etc. for even more goodness.<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/202001/10758933_5f158f845cf830cb3b23d12e0cbc118a_t.jpg\"/></div>"

      "content": "<div>Thanks GDL for posting this build up.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is always great to read your builds, they have great lore, great presentation, and great substance.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have worked hard over the last month to learn arcane builds. As a humble student of the arcane arts, I really like what you have designed.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI can visualise this as:<br/>\n- an extremely powerful defensive tank<br/>\n- with a full wizard spell book providing plenty of versatility and offensive power<br/>\n- plenty of no DC damage dealing options\u00a0<br/>\n- enough spell penetration (SP =30+1d20?) if ILMS/IGMS is desirable, with max toolset SR is 32 I believe so 5% chance of failure if they have SR at max toolset.\u00a0<br/>\n- covered up the fragility aspect of the wizard class very well (900 odd hp with mostly d4-d6 hit die!!!)<br/>\n- a large amount of skill points to invest in anything you desire, albeit cross-classed for much of it<br/>\n- no multiclass experience penalties<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see you have very deliberately kept the AC low (including not taking EMA) to ensure your damage shields are always effective, and with critical hit/sneak attack immunity combined with damage reduction from stoneskin/greater stoneskin/premonition EW and EDR, I believe there would be little lost with that missing AC while you preserve the damage shields as an offensive option.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can see this to be a wonderful teammate for any party as well. It can tank, deal damage through magic shields, ranged damage through ILMS/IGMS, it can buff teammates (ie flame weapon/keen weapon/ empowered bulls/stoneskin/improved invis etc etc), and has a pile of skill points to spend as well to utilise for whatever the party needs, and craft wand/scroll so the UMD'ers in the party can have a great time too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder how useful discipline will actually be in your build, with both small stature and low AC, the odds are stacked against this little one. It might assist with preventing disarms, but that may not concern you much, as any damage you deal will be through damage shields or spells. Likewise with called shots, I suspect having a lower dex score with the damage shields may actually be considered something useful.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>Edit</em>:</strong>\u00a0to clarify, if knockdown immunity is available, then discipline could be dropped?\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect you have left fighter late in your build for EDR I-III for those discipline skill dumps, and if discipline is dropped (I hope Stag is not reading this, he's about to eviscerate me now), then fighter could be taken soon after PM 10 for faster EDR I-III. Extra skill points could be allocated elsewhere, something that I would consider is a few value points in set trap, craft trap and a single point in disable trap (up to deadly trap setting/crafting &amp; retrieval of unused traps, if this is desired).<br/>\n<br/>\nI think spot is valuable for any caster build and I encourage some investment in it if True Seeing is nerfed in one's environment. It is better at seeing enemies at long distances than listen allowing one to prepare well in advance before unleashing some spell power from range to initate combat. In addition spotted enemies once spotted must go out of sight through hiding behind terrain such as walls, going invisible or using HiPS before another spot check is undertaken, whereas listen checks are constantly in place, and a listened enemy can become 'unlistened' particularly if walls or distance get in the way.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSwapping fighter for Champion of Torm would allow access to Spot as a class skill at the cost of needing to take a melee weapon focus, one less combat bonus feat, loss of heavy armor proficiency, to me it seems pretty even, getting that spot score to close to 40 or more plus a few saves might cost a bit. Unsure if its worth it to be honest, it seems pretty even to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnything else I would have to suggest might be a minor tweak or two at most, congratulations on this build and thanks for posting this</div>"

      "content": "<div>Greetings GDL,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your reply.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have taken your build for a bit of a spin in WoG albeit at low levels, and I have already learned to hate archers. There is heaps in the toolkit to deal with em of course :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI made a few adjustments to your fantastic build (hope you view this as the highest complement, if anything!).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have taken CoT, but taken a value level pre-epic to increase fort by +2 and reflex by +2.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI lose a pre-epic feat by having to take a mostly unhelpful melee weapon focus but I gain +2 fort from taking CoT 1 pre-epic (instead of taking Great Fortitude pre-epic). So funnily enough that equalizes things out.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom this CoT level pre-epic I get a nice skill dump for spot which is nice for a caster, and the ability to equip martial weapons/shields/light/medium armor earlier, although due my ability to do much with any of it is limited, apart from any additional properties they might have (like a low AC item with damage reduction or resistances that I usually ignore might be quite nice!).<br/>\n<br/>\nI take EDR I at level 21 as a general feat on for a bit of earlier protection, then the rest of the EDR II and III as bonus feats later on as you recommended, which also allows for big spot skill dumps.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaves end up being slightly better with the small investment in CoT which gives +2 to all saves and is subject to the 20 saves cap.\u00a0Fort is 34 and reflex 19 (from 32 and 15 respectively).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI could drop ESF: Concentration for Epic Fortitude to pump Fort all the way to 38 but decided against it. Additional taunt resistance sounds valuable, it looks like only an enemy with the charisma score of the winner of the Miss Universe beauty pageant is going to succeed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did drop auto-silent but maybe the build would be stronger with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally skills wise I put some points in disable trap/set trap/craft trap for those who love that stuff but you can always drop that for heal skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway at best these are just small tweaks, that you or others might find interesting, it pretty much is the same build.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I noticed your listen score in your original build when I plugged the numbers into the CBC is higher [CBC says Listen 28(33) instead of 28(29) written].\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect this is from the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Gnome\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hidden +4 listen bonus from small stature</a>.\u00a0<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Illusionist(26), Pale Master(10), Champion of Torm(4), Gnome\nSTR: 10\nCON: 18 (32)\nINT: 18 (20)\n\n01: Illusionist(1): Toughness, {Scribe Scroll}\n03: Illusionist(3): Extend Spell\n05: Illusionist(5): Empower Spell\n07: Illusionist(7)\n09: Illusionist(9): Spell Penetration\n11: Illusionist(11)\n13: Illusionist(13)\n15: Pale Master(2): Weapon Focus: Dagger\n17: Pale Master(3): {Darkvision}\n19: Pale Master(5)\n21: Illusionist(14): Epic Damage Reduction I\n23: Pale Master(7)\n25: Pale Master(9)\n27: Illusionist(16): Great Constitution I, (CON=24)\n29: Illusionist(18)\n31: Illusionist(20): Epic Spell Penetration\n33: Illusionist(22): Great Constitution III, (CON=28)\n35: Illusionist(24)\n37: Champion of Torm(3): {Smite Evil}\n39: Illusionist(25): Great Constitution V, (CON=31)\n\nSkillpoints: 276\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9, Mind Effects: +2\nAB (max, naked): 22 (melee), 20 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Wizard(9)\n\n\n01: Concentration(4), Craft Trap(4), Craft Weapon(4), Disable Trap(1), Lore(4), Open Lock(1), Set Trap(2),\u00a0\n03: Concentration(1), Craft Trap(1), Lore(1), Set Trap(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n05: Concentration(1), Craft Trap(1), Lore(1), Set Trap(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n07: Concentration(1), Craft Trap(1), Lore(1), Set Trap(1), Save(3),\u00a0\n09: Concentration(1), Craft Trap(1), Set Trap(1), Save(9),\u00a0\n11: Concentration(1), Craft Trap(1), Set Trap(1), Save(15),\u00a0\n13: Concentration(1), Set Trap(1), Save(22),\u00a0\n15: Concentration(1), Set Trap(1), Save(13),\u00a0\n17: Concentration(2), Listen(2), Set Trap(1),\u00a0\n19: Concentration(1), Disable Trap(1), Listen(1), Set Trap(1),\u00a0\n21: Concentration(1), Set Trap(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(2),\u00a0\n23: Concentration(1), Listen(5), Set Trap(1), Spellcraft(2),\u00a0\n25: Concentration(1), Listen(1), Set Trap(1), Spellcraft(3),\u00a0\n27: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(6),\u00a0\n29: Concentration(1), Disable Trap(3), Spellcraft(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n31: Concentration(1), Disable Trap(3), Spellcraft(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n33: Concentration(1), Disable Trap(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(3),\u00a0\n35: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(13),\u00a0\n37: Disable Trap(3), Spot(1),\u00a0\n39: Concentration(4), Spellcraft(4), Save(1),\u00a0</details></div>"

I'm curious as to how you'd deal with Drow Wizards with this guy, though?<br/>\n<br/>\nI know you have the elemental protection spells and most likely a wand of Prot. from Elements, but I was wondering if it wouldn't be viable to get 2 Epic Energy Resistance - Fire feats for those pesky Darkfire / FW meleers? Also, I don't remember very well, only returned to playing NWN recently and in the old WoG. How does that feat stack with the spells? Does the spell always get consumed first or does the feat resistance apply first to only then consume the spell protection with the leftover damage?<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.: Was that the build you were testing when I ran into you on Ruskis 2 years ago?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers and Kudos!</div>",
