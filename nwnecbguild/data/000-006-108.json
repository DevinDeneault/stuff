Trickery are chosen for Haste and the Invis Line of spells, all of which can be extended and/or crafted into Wands.\u00a0 These two domains provide for the best mix of both offense and defense for combat, in my opinion.\u00a0 However, there is some value in choosing Plant &amp; Animal for Cat\u2019s Grace (or War) access and Improved Summons.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nMace was chosen in this build for bludgeoning and it can still be finessed while wearing a large shield.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Play Style</span></strong><br/>\nPre-epic you\u2019re pretty much like any other hybrid Cleric melee type, augmented by your Rogue Skill set.\u00a0 With a 10 Strength and 18 Dexterity, you\u2019ll want to start with Chain Shirt and Small Shield and rely on your Summons and Buffs, supplemented by Ranged Sneaks, to make your way.\u00a0 As you begin to mature your Cleric spell set, you\u2019ll eventually be able to go with lighter armor or Robes.\u00a0 In epic your Rogue talents begin to mature, and you don\u2019t gain Epic Dodge until Level 30 (just 3 levels shy from the minimum level requirement).\u00a0 In Epic you begin to use your HiPS talents, and become more of an offensive force.\u00a0 <br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nYour preferred melee talent is Turning on Divine Power and Haste and, while buffed to the max, use HiPS to lay waste to your enemy.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Preferred Spell Sets</span></strong><br/>\n1<sup>st</sup>: Bless, Shield of Faith, Prot from Alignment, Divine Favor<br/>\n2<sup>nd</sup>: Bulls Strength, Endurance, Aid, Extended Divine Favor<br/>\n3<sup>rd</sup>: Magic Vestment (x2), Prot.

I guess the downside would be if you get dispelled then your damage output will suffer a little<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect you can live without improved knockdown with HiPS in the build to do plenty of sneak attack damage but I'm not 100% sure, I'm pretty sure you had enough tools in the kit to manage without it?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway thanks for posting this up and happy holidays</div>"

Not having 24 In the primary casting class is always a hard one for me personally to build to but this is one I would try without it ... well done.<br/>\n<br/>\nIncidentally, I wanted to thank you mate.  When I was looking for a new game to play a few years back i was looking at briefly replaying some NwN (one of my favourite games from yesteryear).  I was looking at custom modules when I stumbled on the NwN nights multiplayer servers.  I started on Blackstone Keep with a build I found after scrounging around the Internet for hours ... The Charnel Lord.  I have been to many worlds and experienced many builds since then, but he is still one of my favourite builds and sure beats the heck out of my straight Paladin from the original releases!<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my thanks for sucking me back into this wonderful mess called NwN :). My \u201cbrief\u201d replay is going on 3 years now :). Also, I told my wife it was all your fault ... so there is that ...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>"
