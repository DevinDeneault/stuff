At level 39, you will have the level 19 song, but you will be 5 points shy of the level 20 song. At level 40, the +2 CHA will bring you to 4 points shy of the level 20 song. It shouldn't be too hard to make up for that with gear.<br/>\n<br/>\n Your net UMD will be only 39 until the level 40 Charasma boost, which meaans that you will only be able to use items as if your UMD was 35 until level 40.<br/>\n<br/>\n You can choose to replace Improved Crit with Knockdown, if you value that more. Another option would be to use a finessable Simple weapon, either a mace or a dagger, allowing you to drop Weapon Proficiency: Martial.

If you rise Rdd by ten lvls for example you will have to reduce Bard to 10 and then loose 5 AC from his song to gain merely 2 from dragonic skin. The only reason you might want more Rdd lvls/ less Bard lvls in this build is if you know you can aleady cap your dodge bonus to +20 via items, haste counds also as dodge bonus keep that in mind. Lets say (Boots of the Sun Soul +10, Bard song, mage armour, Haste) would cap that and then you would gain AC only from Rdd's dragonic skin.<br/>\n<br/>\n By the way this build has in a (+5 items, module/ pw) 80 AC plus ED.</div>"

With the amounts of AC this build has plus Dodge/ UD/ ED and a good Improved Invisibility effect from a scroll/ wand i don't think many things will exist that would hit you. Hmm, what sub-races exist for Halflings/ Elves? You could probably gain an additional +2\u00a0 AC if you truly maximize Dexterity with a HIn/ Elf, especially if there is some good sub-race for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n As a side note, what are the expecting AB's of the mobs there?</div>"
