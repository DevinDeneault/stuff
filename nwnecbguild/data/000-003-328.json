      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Good evening friends!<br/>\nAfter you gracefully helped me to build a sorcerer for Amia (Which I freakin' love by the way - thanks!), I persuaded an old friend to come back &amp; play NWN with me. He already played Amia few years back, and he found out he still has a level 21 Barbarian / Fighter. He wants to keep playing it instead of starting from scratch, though problem is, he has no idea how he planned the build or how to take it from there. So I was wondering if any of you great people could help him with how to take the last 9 levels (max level is 30) without destroying the character?  <br/>\nThe build is level 21:\n<blockquote><div>Human, True Neutral<br/>\nFighter (5)<br/>\nBarbarian (16)<br/>\n<br/>\nStats:<br/>\nStrength        20<br/>\nDexterity       14<br/>\nConstitution   16<br/>\nIntelligence    12<br/>\nWisdom         10<br/>\nCharisma        8<br/>\n<br/>\nHP 326<br/>\n<br/>\nSkills:<br/>\nCraft Armor (25)<br/>\nCraft Weapon (25)<br/>\nDiscipline (29)<br/>\nTaunt (22)<br/>\nTumble (14)<br/>\n<br/>\nFeats:<br/>\nBlind-Fight<br/>\nCleave + Great Cleave<br/>\nDodge<br/>\nWeapon Focus: Greataxe<br/>\nWeapon Specialist: Greataxe<br/>\nEpic Weapon Focus: Greataxe<br/>\nImproved Critical: Greataxe<br/>\nKnockdown<br/>\nPower Attack<br/>\nToughness<br/>\n(One of those he might got free with the class, I'm not so great with that)</div></blockquote>\n\nThat's about it, really. He doesn't remember if he planned to add another class. He doesn't remember anything, really. I can only assume he was planning on using a greataxe <br/>\nWhat do you recommend? What should he do next?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks a lot from advance, you guys are awesome. Cheers.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Glad you liked your Sorcerer so far David!<br/>\n<br/>\nNow let's move to your friend's  Barbarian and see what we can do..<br/>\n<br/>\n I recomment finishing this as a Barbarian 20/ Fighter 8/ Rogue 2. You will get RED: 4/-, EWS, Evasion, Full Tumble Ranks (+3 AC), and UMD (Provided he stops spending his skill points in crafts..), ending with a natural 24 STR.<br/>\n<br/>\n1)<strong> Next lvl (22nd) is Fighter</strong> so he can take with his bonus 6th lvl feat, EWS: Greataxe. (Max only Discipline Ranks here).<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Your true Ranks in Tumble should be 12, modified by your DEX to 14, you have listed. Stop taking CC Ranks and wait for Rogue lvls to pump Tumble to first 25 Ranks, then at lvl 27 (last Rogue lvl) to 30 Ranks.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) <strong>Your 23rd lvl, as above it should be Rogue</strong>. Max Tumble Ranks here to 25.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) <strong>Your 24th lvl</strong> should have been your Terrifying Rage lvl, but you have no ranks in Indimidate so, that's out. You don't have time to gather those skill points now that you also need other skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's keep going with <strong>Barbarian</strong>, take your 17th lvl in Barbarian now and max Taunt Ranks &amp; Discipline. Also take Armour Skin here. Get your RED: 3/-<br/>\n<br/>\n5) <strong>Your 25th lvl, should be Fighter 7th</strong>. Take only Discipline Ranks here.<br/>\n<br/>\n6) <strong>Your 26th lvl, should be Fighter 8th</strong>, take Epic Prowess now. Take only Discipline Ranks here.<br/>\n<br/>\n7) <strong>Your 27th lvl, should be Barbarian 18th lvl</strong>, Take Great STR I here, pump only Discipline &amp; Taunt Ranks here.<br/>\n<br/>\n8) <strong>Your 28th lvl, should be Barbarian 19th lvl</strong>, pump only Taunt &amp; Discipline here.<br/>\n<br/>\n9) <strong>Your 29th lvl, should be Rogue 2nd lvl</strong>, By now you should have saved anough skill points to both Max Tumble to 30 Ranks &amp; put the rest of them into UMD in chunks of five. Maybe you can get UMD at 20 Ranks. Get your Evasion<br/>\n<br/>\n10) <strong>Your final and 30th lvl should be your Barbarian 20th lvl</strong>, Take Great STR II, max Discipline &amp; Taunt again, put the leftover skills wherever you like. Get your RED: 4/- <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's it!<br/>\n<br/>\nHappy Hunting,<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
