I don't know if you've ever played Icewind Dale, but you meet a mountain full of the buggers while still at a pretty early level\u00a0 - certainly pre-teen - thereby restricting mage spells and with scant fire/acid arrows. It be damned hard going!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a generalization, a dead hill giant is a good hill giant, so congratz!</div>",
