HP could be better. There's no uncanny dodge which would have been nice, which is why I haven't tried to pump dex. Mords and dispels I believe are your enemies, which with 38 CLs you should be somewhat resistant too, although breaches will always strip some buffs away and a dedicated arcane caster will always cause you problems.\u00a0<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Cleric(38), Monk(1), Rogue(1), Human\nSTR: 14 (24)\nCON: 14\nINT: 14\n\n01: Cleric(1): Knockdown, Blind Fight, Domain Trickery, Domain War\n03: Cleric(3): Weapon Proficiency Exotic\n05: Cleric(5)\n07: Cleric(7)\n09: Cleric(9): Empower Spell\n11: Cleric(11)\n13: Cleric(13)\n15: Cleric(15): Silent Spell\n17: Cleric(17)\n19: Cleric(19)\n21: Cleric(21): Epic Weapon Focus: Kama\n23: Cleric(22)\n25: Cleric(24)\n27: Cleric(26): Epic Fortitude, Great Wisdom I, (WIS=20)\n29: Cleric(28)\n31: Cleric(30)\n33: Cleric(32): Great Strength I, Great Wisdom III, (STR=20), (WIS=22)\n35: Cleric(34)\n37: Rogue(1)\n39: Cleric(37): Great Strength III, (STR=23)\n\nSkillpoints: 223\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9\nAB (max, naked): 36 (melee), 26 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Cleric(9)\n\n\n01: Concentration(4), Spellcraft(4), Save(12),\u00a0\n03: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(18),\u00a0\n05: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(24),\u00a0\n07: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(30),\u00a0\n09: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(36),\u00a0\n11: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(42),\u00a0\n13: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(48),\u00a0\n15: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(54),\u00a0\n17: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(60),\u00a0\n19: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(66),\u00a0\n21: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(72),\u00a0\n23: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(2), Save(55),\u00a0\n25: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(61),\u00a0\n27: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(67),\u00a0\n29: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(73),\u00a0\n31: Concentration(1), Save(81),\u00a0\n33: Concentration(1), Save(89),\u00a0\n35: Concentration(1), Save(97),\u00a0\n37: Disable Trap(24), Open Lock(10), Search(10), Set Trap(13), Spot(40), Tumble(15),\u00a0\n39: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(4),\u00a0</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I like seeing Clerics that are more than healbots.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you indicated the likely weaknesses are opponents with dispel on hit, spell breaches or spammed dispels. A Boss that combines buff stripping with knockdown or disarm could be very hard to deal with. Even with 50% concealment, they will eventually get that knockdown.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">The monk level in your second build seems like a waste of a class to me. Since you're wearing armor you miss out on most monk benefits, it isn't used as a Discipline dump, and you don't take it in pre-epic levels to boost your saves. Currently the only thing it adds in comparison to a Cler38/Rog2\u00a0is early Evasion instead of early UMD. Maybe the increased playabilty is worth it but I personally dislike adding levels that are wasted at 40.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough it goes against the entire concept of this build, which is a melee Cler38/Monk1/Rog1, I would recommend a Cler36/Figh2/Rog2 or something similar for a high caster level battle cleric that wears armor.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
