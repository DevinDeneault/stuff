      "content": "<div>I've started playing on WoG and it's been a ton of fun! Now it's time to put that hard-won experience to the test.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really appreciate that the WoG Ranger has 6 skill points per level, as this allows from interesting builds. The Versatile Ranger was built around the concept of a \"Retributor\". The build was inspired by:\u00a0 <br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build123420.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/buil ... 23420.html</a>\u00a0 <br/>\n<br/>\nThis retributor was a skilled Ranger who was burned out of his home by the minions of the Pomaj. Now he stalks the forests (high Hide / Move silently) pursuing rustic revenge (Assassin). Life in the woods is hard, so he must make do with whatever he can find (no weapon focus but can use any weapon).\u00a0 He recently saved an Elvish Mage and she taught him a few tricks to help with his crusade (high UMD). He was outnumbered in that fight, but skillful use of homemade traps (high craft and set traps), deft maneuver (high Tumble) and discipline won the day. In the aftermath, he grimly looted the bodies and bargained the lot for a fair price in Borderkeep (some Appraisal).\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe advantages / disadvantages are:<br/>\n- Low hit points (Elves...). Hopefully this can be protected by using a sword and shield, high tumble, animal companion and the full Ranger spell list.<br/>\n- No dev crit. To compensate this build provides Bane of Enemies and Death Attack.<br/>\n-Only 37 AB normally, 39 AB against Bane enemies. Perhaps the ability to use any weapon will provide opportunities to improve this.<br/>\n- Low saves. Compensated by taking Epic Will, Fortitude and Reflexes. Also some racial and class saves. <br/>\n- Animal companion. A good distraction early on, but likely to become a snack for an epic level Boss<br/>\n- Cannot wear heavy armour, but gains +8 AC via Tumble. <br/>\n- High UMD to provide additional flexibility<br/>\n- Decent Move Silently / Hide, which can be boosted by Woodland Stride, Ranger spells and items.<br/>\n- Jack of all trades, but master of none. I suspect this build will be fun early on, but struggle to fill a specific role in an epic level party.<br/>\n<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>\u00a0\nDEX: 16 (18)\nWIS: 12 (14)\nCHA: 8\nElf: (Hardiness vs. Enchantments, Keen Sense, Low-light Vision, Skill Affinity: Listen, Skill Affinity: Search, Skill Affinity: Spot, Sleeplessness)\n02: Ranger(2)\n04: Ranger(4): STR+1, (STR=16)\n06: Ranger(6): Blind Fight\n08: Assassin(2): WIS+1, {Uncanny Dodge I}, (WIS=13)\n10: Ranger(8)\n12: Ranger(10): WIS+1, Cleave, Favored Enemy: Humans, (WIS=14)\n14: Ranger(12)\n16: Assassin(3): DEX+1, (DEX=17)\n18: Ranger(15): Improved Knockdown, Favored Enemy: Constructs\n20: Ranger(17): DEX+1, (DEX=18)\n22: Ranger(19)\n24: Ranger(21): STR+1, Bane of Enemies, (STR=17)\n26: Assassin(5)\n28: Assassin(7): STR+1, (STR=18)\n30: Assassin(8): Epic Fortitude\n32: Ranger(23): STR+1, Favored Enemy: Outsiders, (STR=19)\n34: Assassin(11)\n36: Ranger(24): STR+1, Great Strength II, (STR=22)\n38: Assassin(14): Epic Reflexes\n40: Ranger(25): STR+1, Favored Enemy: Elementals, (STR=24)\nHitpoints: 380\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 26/22/26\nBAB: 29\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 22/29\nAlignment Changes: 0\nAppraise 13(15), Craft Trap 28(30), Disable Trap 1(5), Discipline 42(49), Heal 10(12), Hide 27(31), Listen 11(15), Lore 8(10), Move Silently 27(31), Search 21(25), Set Trap 26(30), Spot 21(25), Tumble 41(45), UMD 37(36)\n\u00a0\n02: Craft Trap(1), Discipline(1), Heal(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(1), \n04: Craft Trap(1), Discipline(1), Heal(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(1), \n06: Search(1), Spot(1), \n08: Appraise(2), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), \n10: Craft Trap(1), Discipline(1), Heal(1), Listen(1), Lore(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Spot(1), \n12: Craft Trap(1), Discipline(1), Hide(1), Lore(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Spot(1), \n14: Craft Trap(1), Discipline(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Spot(1), \n16: Appraise(2), Tumble(5), UMD(5), \n18: Craft Trap(1), Discipline(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Spot(1), \n20: Craft Trap(1), Discipline(1), Heal(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Spot(1), \n22: Craft Trap(1), Discipline(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Spot(1), \n24: Craft Trap(1), Discipline(1), \n26: Appraise(1), Hide(1), Tumble(2), UMD(2), \n28: Appraise(1), Hide(1), Tumble(2), UMD(2), \n30: Appraise(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Tumble(2), UMD(2), \n32: Craft Trap(1), Discipline(3), Heal(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(1), \n34: Craft Trap(1), Tumble(3), UMD(2), \n36: Craft Trap(1), Discipline(4), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(1), \n38: Hide(1), Set Trap(1), Tumble(2), UMD(2), \n40: Craft Trap(1), Discipline(4), Heal(1), Set Trap(1), Spot(1),</details></div>"

      "content": "<div>Nice.\u00a0 I really like the idea and thought behind this, and I think it would be fun to play.\u00a0 If you don't mind, I'll offer you some of my insights.\u00a0 There is a lot of synergy between Ranger and Assassin.\u00a0 The Ranger provides great stealth buffs to enhance the Assassin as well as lending\u00a0 Ultravision to couple with the Assassin's Darkness ability.\u00a0 Let's get to it:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.\u00a0 Start you Wisdom at 14 and drop your Strength to 14.\u00a0 This will net you an extra feat in Epic and you can still end with a 24 Strength.<br/>\n2.\u00a0 Dexterity.\u00a0 I think you can get away with a 16 Dex by combining one decent Dex item with Ranger's Cat's Grace and/or an Ion Stone of Dexterity.\u00a0 This could allow you to get your Strength to 26 for another point of AB.\u00a0 Padded Armor and +12 to Dex will be optimal (but could be challenging to combine all the necessary gear.<br/>\n3.\u00a0 I know some changes were made to the Assassin class in the environment where you are playing.\u00a0 Epic Prowess is considered to be a bonus feat for Assassins.\u00a0 You can select that on Assassin 14 (drop Epic Reflexes) and then choose another feat where you had Epic Prowess.<br/>\n4. FEs:\u00a0 I drop one of those for Giants.\u00a0 Probably Constructs would get the axe.<br/>\n5.\u00a0 You can safely take UMD to 31 (32) to insure 100% success rate on all scroll casting.\u00a0 Orion like 33, but I find 31 is enough.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n6.\u00a0 Since you are not Dex-based, and because you are not going Dev Crit path, Power Attack-- and subsequently Cleave -- are of limited utility in this build.\u00a0 I would exchange those for Weapon Focus and something else, and then take EWF where you had Prowess.<br/>\n7. Final class split.\u00a0 I feel like something is missing.\u00a0 Evasion maybe?\u00a0 Hide in Plain Sight.\u00a0 You could drop that last Assassin level and put in Monk or, if you can squeeze the Dodge/Mobility feats, Shadowdancer.\u00a0 Or, if you are married to Ranger/Assassin only, drop the last Assassin level for Ranger 26 for another bonus feat.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere, that's it.\u00a0 Cheers!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Great work with the build SnorriHT and GDL.<br/>\nHaven't seen a great ranger build for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne tweak I would consider is Ranger 25 / Assassin 13 / Shadowdancer 2, which would provide HiPS and Evasion.<br/>\nBoth HiPS and Evasion provide a lot to the build, especially with Camouflage and One with the Land and other outdoor bonuses for huge stealth scores\u00a0<br/>\nI think Dodge and Mobility could be swapped for Point Blank Shot and Power Attack<br/>\n<br/>\nCleave can be changed for a weapon focus in a dual wielding slashing weapon (rangers get ITWF for free in light armor), my preference with a Str based ranger with exotic weapon proficiency, is the two-bladed sword, you are much harder to disarm than a kukri wielder. Kukri or Shortsword/Handaxe would allow you to switch between one handed + shield and dual wielding though.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Set Trap, due to Take 20 you should aim for Set Trap 15 modified unless you plan to set traps during combat. One with the land will add +4 to set trap, Cat's will add +1-2, so you could even manage with a set trap score of 10-11. Without rogue in the build you will never be able to set epic traps.<br/>\nCraft trap is too high at 30 modified, drop it to modified 19-25 for a 50% chance of crafting deadly electrical/fire traps, it can be buffed with int potions and items of trap crafting<br/>\nTumble you should put 40 ranks for the AC bonus so 40(44) is enough<br/>\nI would put remaining points to max out stealth but I have no experience playing a build with stealth high 20s at lvl 40 even with the buffs with camouflage if you have the skill points you may as well try to do it well<br/>\nA higher spot score (40+) and listen around 20-30 would be what I would aim for if I have the points<br/>\n<br/>\nJust with the UMD on WoG, please note DM Wise only switched on the hardcore spell check with scrolls in the last week or so.<br/>\nMrZork's advice was modified UMD 31, however I do feel a little uncertain about that advice given it was switched off for the player base over a number of years.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy practice is to go on what is recommended on the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Use_magic_device\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NWN Wiki: Use Magical Device</a>, which states\u00a0<br/>\n- a DC check of 25 + the\u00a0level\u00a0of the spell to cast a spell from a\u00a0scroll<br/>\n<br/>\nFor 100% success with lvl 9 scrolls, 25 + 9 = 34, so modified UMD 33 (as the lowest roll is 1) is enough to always pass the check, if it is as listed in described in the NWN Wiki<br/>\nI credit Hip's guide to UMD on this forum as well to help me make that decision.\u00a0<br/>\nMy opinion is 31 is enough for 90% success for lvl 9 scrolls and 95% success for lvl 8 scrolls, but if you have a spare two skill points, why not just put it to 33.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall your mileage may vary on WoG depending on how it all works but I suspect it should work as described in the Wiki, even if it isn't, I like to 'future proof' builds that I play, in case the environment changes, if that makes any sense, PW constantly change as described with the checks being switched on.</div>"
