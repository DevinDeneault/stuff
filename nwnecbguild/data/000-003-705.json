summons, damage shields, ILMS/IGMS, stoneskin/greater stoneskin/premonition, improved invisibility, BBoD, greater sanc, time stop, mords, epic mage armor, epic warding<br/>\nMonk 5 for Monk UBAB, evasion, 5-7 APR,\u00a0<br/>\nRDD 10 for very solid strength gains, AC gains, and other gains.<br/>\nManually took knockdown to avoid waiting till lvl 40 odd for the free feat.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnds up with Base 38 Strength (cap-able to 50), Base AB 40, nearly 400 HP, 13 bonus AC, 200+ skill points etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nHad a look in the ECB archives, the most similar build being <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build245169.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Zen Spellblade</a> (Sorc 26/Monk 4/RDD 10) which is a Kama user 2 less AB 4 less Str 40 less hp and 2 more AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the ECB Tapatalk Forum, Empyre65 has his <a class=\"postlink\"

stronger 'Monk' than Sorc.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nFists which do 1-20 damage and mind immunity for example, are sorely missed here!\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also has 11 more AC, which I have attempted to compensate with the sorcerer spell kit including epic mage armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway looked pretty cool to me, thought I would share this one, see if you guys had any interest / suggested tweaks.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheres something cool about a monk who wanders around with extended expedious retreat, flings out 3-4 fireballs, casts Time Stop/Mords then eliminates the enemy mage, with damage shields and Epic Warding up then proceeds to beat up the enemy with 50 str fists....<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\"

Great to hear you have been working on a similar project yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n1d8 is the same as a standard longsword :)\u00a0<br/>\nCombined with a Warrior's AB, and up to 50 Strength, I see no problem here, continue moving along now...<br/>\n<br/>\nI could get the 1-20 damage fists with the build but I would have to drop RDD and go Sorc 24/Monk 16. I would probably want to go dexterity based then. Or drop spellcasting and play Empyre65's build. He has already done all the ground work, no need to reinvent the wheel if you really want those 1-20 damage fists.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI didn't like Kama because it can get disarmed as a small weapon pretty easily and sometimes one gets sick of equipping em.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI have ignored dex AC due to the build not having uncanny dodge.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt has heaps of spells starting from summons at level 2, improved invisibility, empowered and extended spell buffs and ending with Epic Mage Armor to help compensate for this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also did not pump it particularly high for the option of damage shields.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, the build gets +13 AC from Tumble (8), RDD (4) and Monk (1).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI adjusted the build for a Sorc 25 / Monk 5 / RDD 10 split, I just took knockdown manually, its too long to wait till lvl 40 to have that feat.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does have potentially lots of Bigby spell castings, but I am wary of spell resistant opponents.\u00a0</div>"

The reason fists can climb to 1d20 is to attempt to balance (+5 1d20+0 20x2) them against the (+5 1d8+5 19-20 x2) longsword. It works to a degree, until you drop keen, flaming, paly spells, etc on the longsword ... then not so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, I have been playing a bunch with fist builds, Web peaked my interest in them again ... and hell an RDD can punch most stuff to death without the monk bonuses :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>"

They always seem really awkward for me to play as a true merge.  Either you cast or you fight, you cannot do both in NWN and both are offensive classes.  So when I merge them, I tend to be very specific goal orientated.  Meaning I may add sorcercer for animal buffs and damage shield to my melee kinda approach ... but it is a melee build.  Or, I may add quick movement and move cap breakage to my caster build ... but it is a caster build.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would probably end up treating this build as a straight caster, nullifying most of the value of it I suspect.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIn summary, I struggle to play these properly and so I also struggle with that exact preference ...

You retain undispellability, get slightly weaker penetration, but get an extra mid epic skill dump. KD/IKD is not so important as long as you can spam Bigby VI.

      "content": "<div>I did some testing regarding the SR decrease in NWN EE. Neither Nature's Balance nor any of the breach spells stack when it comes to reducing SR, only the highest decrease is applied.<br/>\n<br/>\nBear in mind that Nature's Balance can be dispelled by casting Mords, so the SR decrease from Nature's Balance can be removed by Mords and the target will end up with -10 SR even if the Nature's Balance SR decrease was higher. However multiple casts of Nature's Balance each have their own dispel check, so if you cast 3 Nature's Balance spells with an SR decrease greater than -10 then the Mords will have to dispel all 3 of those debuffs in order to reduce the SR decrease to -10.</div>"
