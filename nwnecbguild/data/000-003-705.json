This is just a rough build to showcase the synergy between Cler/RDD and Wiz/PM so I didn't bother with a full skill progression. Like most of my builds this is optimised for level 40 play, so the early levels will be challenging if playing solo due to the low caster level.<br/>\nDracolich Duo synergy explanation: [<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/best-pvm-duo-t2355325.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">best-pvm-duo-t2355325.html</a>]<br/>\nExample Cler/RDD: [<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/dracolich-duo-d-cleric-28-bard-2-red-dragon-discip-t2355326.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dracolich-duo-d-cleric-28-bard-2-red-dr ... 55326.html</a>]<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main concept for this build is a bulky nuke mage. With Evasion, PM immunities, 9/- Physical DR, Epic Warding, and high AC, this is a robust mage that can both AC tank and DR tank. Combining these defences with offensive no-save spells and damage shields, it is able to deal with a wide range of enemies. If melee is more useful than damage spells then it can tank for your Cler/RDD party member while using support spells such as the Bigby's line and dealing reciprocal damage via damage shields. With IExp and a +5 AC small shield this build can potentially reach 82 AC, which should be enough for AC tanking on most low/medium magic servers. The lack of Epic Dodge is a shame for an AC tank, but PM immunities and damage shields make getting hit less of an issue. If low AC is wanted then simply unequipping the shield and going flatfooted will reduce your AC to 34 which should be low enough to take full advantage of your damage shields. Combining the damage shields (1d6 + 56 Acid, 1d6 + 28 Fire, 1d4 + 5 Magical = 92-105 damage) with PM immunities, 9/- Physical DR, Epic Warding, and Cler/RDD heals should be able to take care of many opponents that melee and nuke spells can't. It can also set epic traps at level 40 if spells are not enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nChoosing a specialist school will give extra spell slots but choosing the right school depends on your environment, I recommend generalist unless you have previous mage experience in your environment. Usually I would recommend Illusion but Balagarn's Iron Horn and Mass Haste can be very useful, especially since you will also be buffing and supporting your Cler/RDD companion.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis build finishes with 22 CON and 24 INT since 36 INT gives an extra level 9 spell slot. By dropping starting DEX to 12 you can start with 18 INT which will let you either drop G INT 2 and still end with 24 INT or keep those feats and end with 24 CON. If more STR is wanted then drop DEX to 14 and raise STR to 10.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith ESPen you have 34 + 1d20 on your SR checks but it's not really necessary since Mords lowers all non-monk SR by 10. You should be able to manage with just GSPen or even with no SPen feats at all. There are few essential feats in this build so there is room to include Craft Wand by swapping one of the feats. If casting in Expertise is enabled on your server then consider getting Improved Combat Casting. The current saves are fairly mediocre even with the Spellcraft bonus, they can be improved by swapping some of the chosen feats for save feats. At level 18 the build gets Shield Proficiency in order to use small shields, this can be dropped if the properties or extra AC from shields aren't particularly useful on your server. By swapping a G INT for a G CON and rearranging feats you can get EDR at level 30 instead of 33, I decided not to bother since I prefer this feat progression to the rearranged one.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nClass: Rogue 2 / Wizard 28 / Pale Master 10<br/>\nRace: Gnome<br/>\nAlignment: Any Non-Good<br/>\nPlayability: 24-40 PvM<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 6<br/>\nDEX: 16<br/>\nCON: 18 (22)<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 16 (24)<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Rogue(1): Expertise<br/>\n02: Wizard(1)<br/>\n03: Wizard(2): Spell Penetration<br/>\n04: Wizard(3): INT+1, (INT=17)<br/>\n05: Wizard(4)<br/>\n06: Wizard(5): Silent Spell, Greater Spell Penetration<br/>\n07: Wizard(6)<br/>\n08: Wizard(7): INT+1, (INT=18)<br/>\n09: Wizard(8): Empower Spell<br/>\n10: Wizard(9)<br/>\n11: Pale Master(1)<br/>\n12: Pale Master(2): INT+1, Maximize Spell, (INT=19)<br/>\n13: Pale Master(3)<br/>\n14: Pale Master(4)<br/>\n15: Pale Master(5): Improved Expertise<br/>\n16: Pale Master(6): INT+1, (INT=20)<br/>\n17: Pale Master(7)<br/>\n18: Pale Master(8): Shield<br/>\n19: Pale Master(9)<br/>\n20: Pale Master(10): INT+1, (INT=21)<br/>\n21: Wizard(10): Epic Skill Focus: Concentration, Great Intelligence I, (INT=22)<br/>\n22: Wizard(11)<br/>\n23: Wizard(12)<br/>\n24: Wizard(13): CON+1, Epic Spell Penetration, (CON=19)<br/>\n25: Wizard(14)<br/>\n26: Wizard(15): Extend Spell<br/>\n27: Wizard(16): Armor Skin<br/>\n28: Wizard(17): CON+1, (CON=20)<br/>\n29: Wizard(18)<br/>\n30: Wizard(19): Toughness<br/>\n31: Wizard(20): Great Intelligence II, (INT=23)<br/>\n32: Wizard(21): CON+1, (CON=21)<br/>\n33: Wizard(22): Epic Damage Reduction I<br/>\n34: Wizard(23): Epic Spell: Epic Warding<br/>\n35: Wizard(24)<br/>\n36: Wizard(25): INT+1, Epic Damage Reduction II, (INT=24)<br/>\n37: Wizard(26): Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor<br/>\n38: Wizard(27)<br/>\n39: Wizard(28): Epic Damage Reduction III<br/>\n40: Rogue(2): CON+1, (CON=22)<br/>\n<br/>\nConcentration 42(60), Disable Trap 5(14), Heal 43(42), Open Lock 1(4), Pick Pocket 1(4), Search 26(33), Set Trap 43(48), Spellcraft 42(49), Spot 43(46), Tumble 40(43), UMD 41(40)<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nNaked Stats<br/>\nHitpoints: 482<br/>\nSkillpoints: 327<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 26/22/21<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9, Mind Effects: +2<br/>\nBAB: 19<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 18 (melee), 23 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 30/35<br/>\nSpell Casting: Wizard(9)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nBuffed Stats (Assuming +12 DEX, +12 CON, +12 INT, +5 EB weapons, +5 AC items, and Haste)<br/>\nAB: 19 (BAB) - 2 (STR) + 5 (EB Bonus) + 1 (Size) = +23<br/>\nAC: 10 (Base) + 9 (DEX) + 8 (Tumble) + 2 (Feats) + 6 (PM Bonus) + 20 (AC Bonus) + 4 (Haste) + 5 (Epic Mage Armor) + 1 (Mage Armor) + 1 (Size) = 66 (72 with a +5 AC small shield)<br/>\nHP: 202 (Base) + 480 (CON) + 40 (Feats) = 722<br/>\nFortitude: 20 (Base) + 12 (CON) = 32<br/>\nReflex: 18 (Base) + 9 (DEX) = 27<br/>\nWill: 23 (Base) - 1 (WIS) = 22<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are several Rog/Wiz/PMs in the archives but most of them are AC tanks that neglect casting and so aren't really comparable.<br/>\n<br/>\nRog3/Wiz27/PM10 by Orion2019.

In particular for this build, losing the extra AC is actually a positive since it makes it easier for opponents to hit your damage shields when flatfooted. Since this is optimised for level 40 the extra Rogue level isn't worth dropping a Wizard level, although for a smooth levelling variant your level layout of Rog3/Wiz27/PM10 would probably be best.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
