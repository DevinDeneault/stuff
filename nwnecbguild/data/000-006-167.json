      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hail, mighty ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\n I have had very little time to look into the community. RL has gone overboard with its demands and I have been having a hard time coping with it. Neverwinter Nights is and will always be a passion for me, but at the end of the day it is still entertainment, so when things get tight, that's where the cutbacks start. But today I do have a bit of time, and I will take advantage of it to post a really cool build I devised for Valerfor when he and I were discussing builds a while back. It's a drow fencer, inspired by Drizzt Do'Urden's nemesis Artemis Entreri, although being a defensive build, it doesn't dual-wield in favor of a shield to further increase its already high AC.<br/>\n<br/>\n Low HP can be an issue early, but you can counter that by sniping too or just outlasting your foes with Expertise. Mages will be a problem, so you should have spell mantle scrolls available to deal with them. He has VERY HIGH AB for a build with 19 levels of Rogue, Epic Dodge and enough UMD to use Improved Invisibility wands or scrolls at will from very early on. Damage-wise, he has EWS and crits A LOT, has good Sneak Attack damage, but against crit immune monsters with DR he will have to find alternative ways to do damage (Darkfire scrolls, for instance). Crippling Strike comes late as the icing to the cake.

IMO definitely worth the 1 AC/AB and with crit range of 13-20 on keened shortsword, I never had a problem with damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n In terms of leveling, I noticed a slight increase in difficulty in the mid-late 20s as monsters improved, but before you get Epic Dodge and your epic Fighter Feats (EWF, EP, etc), but nothing major. And moving the Ftr levels up in epic just pushes back ED, which I wouldn't advise.<br/>\n<br/>\n But regardless of SC5 or not, it's a versatile build (not many WM builds say that for the feat investment) with good defense (high AC, Improved Evasion with great reflex save, Epic Dodge, framework in the build for SC5 if you want it) and good offense (highish AB, WM crits, traps, 10d6 sneaks, offensive scrolls if PW has them); Just needs shoring up the Will and Fort saves, but you have UMD for full potion/scroll access.<br/>\n<br/>\n One of my favorites!<br/>\n<br/>\n Dante<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks, Dante!<br/>\n<br/>\nI like this build very much as well. Solid defense, very good offense except against Sneak-immune mobs, but even then it has some tricks up its sleeve. Ever since I posted that build, I have shifted to the belief that this one is actually better, even for worlds with loads of dispel. All one needs to have is enough scrolls / wands to rebuff at will. On WoG there is also a LOT of dispel around, but there you can get enough gold to resupply on II scrolls and you can buy wands from other players, so you don't need SCV. So, unless you can't find Improved Invisibility in abundance for some reason, I'd stick with this version. The only downside is the XP penalty, which I forgot to mention in the OP. Going Halfling negates that, but then you can't go Rapier, as it's a medium weapon, so 2-handed for a Halfling. Short sword is the choice then.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
