I would rate a difficult to kill rogue sneaker as a pretty difficult opponent to face!<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably the most eminent example of such a build is Kail Pendragon's <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build253741.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pale Sneaker of Doom</a> (and <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/515522/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Paler Sneaker of Doom</a>) which are Halfling Rogue/Bard/Pale Masters.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis build I use Wizard as the secondary class, make it an elf.<br/>\nIt gets a wizard spell book, up to level 6 wizard spells, which is largely for summons so you can sneak em and some low level buffs and scroll and wand crafting.\u00a0<br/>\nBuffs like Stoneskin, Improved Invisibility, Flame Weapon and Cats Grace/Endurance are highly valuable as well as the ability to craft wands of Shadow Conjuration for the 7 caster level darkness spell for a bit of darkness/ultravision power sneak killing power.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of skill points, 10d6 sneak attack, 5-6 APR / round dual shortswords. Epic dodge and Improved evasion. +18 AC from Tumble 40 and PM 10. Critical hit/Sneak Attack immunity. EMA / EW.<br/>\nBest specialty school if you have to have one, is likely going to be Illusionist at the cost of enchantment school (prot vs spells, mass haste would be the main spells you would miss).<br/>\nWith Dex near capped or with +5 to set trap via items or one with the land scrolls, this guy can set epic traps.<br/>\nSlippery mind I put at the end for something to look forward to when you hit level 40.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne build uses the same class combinations, malibu-fr's <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build235936.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dodgy Tank</a>\u00a0which was designed as a rapier and shield wielder in PvP, with all the sneak attack damage / hit I thought dual wielding would be cooler, along with having Wiz 6 spells in PvM. WoG players will look forward to Wiz 6 with the ability to scribe PnP TT scrolls for a huge AB boost in combat and +1 APR.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Build details:</strong><br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Wizard(5), Rogue(19), Pale Master(16), Elf\nSTR: 12\nCON: 12\nINT: 16\n\n01: Rogue(1): Blind Fight\n03: Wizard(2): Weapon Finesse\n05: Rogue(2): {Evasion}\n07: Rogue(4)\n09: Rogue(6): Ambidexterity\n11: Rogue(8)\n13: Rogue(10): Crippling Strike\n15: Rogue(11): Improved Two-Weapon Fighting\n17: Rogue(13): Improved Evasion\n19: Rogue(15)\n21: Pale Master(1): Epic Weapon Focus: Shortsword\n23: Pale Master(2)\n25: Pale Master(4)\n27: Rogue(17): Epic Dodge\n29: Pale Master(7)\n31: Pale Master(9)\n33: Rogue(18): Epic Prowess\n35: Pale Master(12)\n37: Pale Master(14)\n39: Pale Master(16): Epic Spell: Epic Warding, Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor\n\nSkillpoints: 347\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9, Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +4\nAB (max, naked): 38 (melee), 35 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Wizard(6)\n\n\n01: Disable Trap(4), Hide(4), Move Silently(4), Open Lock(4), Search(4), Set Trap(1), Spot(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(11),\u00a0\n03: Save(21),\u00a0\n05: Disable Trap(4), Hide(4), Move Silently(4), Open Lock(4), Search(3), Set Trap(4), Spot(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4),\u00a0\n07: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n09: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(11),\u00a0\n11: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(17),\u00a0\n13: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(23),\u00a0\n15: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Open Lock(2), Search(2), Spot(2), Tumble(2), UMD(2), Save(8),\u00a0\n17: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Open Lock(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(16),\u00a0\n19: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(26),\u00a0\n21: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spellcraft(7), Save(27),\u00a0\n23: Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Save(33),\u00a0\n25: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(39),\u00a0\n27: Disable Trap(7), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Set Trap(23), Spot(7), Tumble(7), UMD(7),\u00a0\n29: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(3),\u00a0\n31: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Save(9),\u00a0\n33: Disable Trap(6), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(6), Tumble(5), UMD(4),\u00a0\n35: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spellcraft(3),\u00a0\n37: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spellcraft(3),\u00a0\n39: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(3),\u00a0</details>\n<br/>\nOther Rogue / PM builds:<br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>ECB Archives</strong><br/>\nSearch Results Builds with 0 to 40 levels of any class, 1 to 40 levels of rogue, and 1 to 40 levels of pale master.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">When I experimented with assassin builds, I tried different approaches with wizard. One combination was with PM as third class. PM has the stealth skills as class skills and can qualify early for assassin. I wanted to keep assassin levels as high as possible (you know me), and tried Wizard 4/ PM 10/ Assassin 26 with level 5 spells. But I finally leaned more towards Wizard 10/ PM 2/ Assassin 28 and level 6 spells. The AC was better with the first. The caster level and DA better with the second. I started out with PM to get stealth skills, but saw the synergy with wizard too. So the W4/PM10/A26 spread was the closest I got to your build here, Orion. So no epic spells for me.<br/>\nEdit:I tried both Elf and Halfling. Halfling has better AB, AC and stealth. Elf has better detection.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If I were a rogue who could make up to wizard 4 wands I'd be pretty happy :) Lots of great Wiz 4 spells. I might start exploring this idea soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for exploring this with me by the way. Great to have your collective experience on board.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
