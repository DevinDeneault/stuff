Animal domain also gets true seeing at level 3 as a cleric domain spell, which is normally a level 5+ spell.\u00a0<br/>\nSecond domain could be anything, I think the strongest would be strength domain (for extra divine power / day) or healing (empowered cures on your summons)<br/>\nIt still has an AB of 45 plus the same divine arrow damage, up to 6 attacks / round with haste and rapid shot.<br/>\nHP is lower to boost wisdom and saves are lower without paladin.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Wizard(7), Cleric(8), Arcane Archer(25), Elf\nAny alignment (Lawful Neutral, True Neutral or Chaotic Neutral for smite and alignment spell immunity)\n\nDEX: 14\nWIS: 14\nCHA: 14 (30)\nElf: (Hardiness vs. Enchantments, Keen Sense, Low-light Vision, Skill Affinity: Listen, Skill Affinity: Search, Skill Affinity: Spot, Sleeplessness)\n02: Cleric(1): Domain Animal, Domain Healing\n04: Wizard(3): CHA+1, (CHA=15)\n06: Cleric(2): Power Attack\n08: Wizard(5): CHA+1, Craft Wand, (CHA=16)\n10: Wizard(6)\n12: Arcane Archer(2): CHA+1, Blind Fight, (CHA=17)\n14: Arcane Archer(4)\n16: Arcane Archer(6): CHA+1, (CHA=18)\n18: Arcane Archer(8): Toughness\n20: Arcane Archer(10): CHA+1, (CHA=19)\n22: Cleric(5)\n24: Cleric(7): CHA+1, Great Charisma I, (CHA=21)\n26: Arcane Archer(12)\n28: Arcane Archer(14): CHA+1, Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow, (CHA=23)\n30: Arcane Archer(16): Great Charisma III, (CHA=24)\n32: Arcane Archer(18): CHA+1, Epic Toughness I, (CHA=25)\n34: Arcane Archer(20)\n36: Arcane Archer(22): CHA+1, Great Charisma V, Epic Prowess, (CHA=28)\n38: Arcane Archer(24)\n40: Cleric(8): CHA+1, (CHA=30)\nHitpoints: 312\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 22/24/22\nBAB: 26\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 16/26\nCleric(4)\n\n\n\n01: Concentration(4), Disable Trap(1), Heal(3), Lore(3), Open Lock(1), Set Trap(1),\u00a0\n03: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Lore(2),\u00a0\n05: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Save(2),\u00a0\n07: Tumble(5),\u00a0\n09: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(3), Save(1),\u00a0\n11: Spot(10),\u00a0\n13: Search(3), Spot(1),\u00a0\n15: Search(3), Spot(1),\u00a0\n17: Tumble(5), Save(2),\u00a0\n19: Save(14),\u00a0\n21: Concentration(11), Spellcraft(13),\u00a0\n23: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(3),\u00a0\n25: Spot(6),\u00a0\n27: Spot(1), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n29: Search(3), Spot(1),\u00a0\n31: Search(3), Spot(1),\u00a0\n33: Spot(1), Save(10),\u00a0\n35: Spot(1), Save(20),\u00a0\n37: Spot(1), Tumble(5), Save(20),\u00a0\n39: Spot(1), Save(30),\u00a0</details>\n<strong>Addition 2:</strong><br/>\nStarted playtesting the red mage (dual cleric - wizard up to lvl 4 spells) version which I liked better of the two. Its very nice in environments where buffs can be applied to ranged weapons and arrows (ie WoG), such as flame weapon. There was plenty of AB early on, so I took more wizard levels over cleric at the beginning (for faster invisibility), but kept the lvl 2 cleric 1 to access animal domain for empowered summons. Have also added a skill schedule for the red mage version. Keen senses + wisdom score + spot is pretty nice for detecting enemies from a distance. Very easy to play and very easy to level.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Addition 3:</strong><br/>\nPlanned spell list for the red mage version<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Cleric:\nLevel 2: Silence, Eagles, Cats/Bulls/Endurance, Barkskin, Ultravision\nLevel 4: Divine Power\nWizard (s - somatic only, no arcane spell failure in armor):\nLevel 2: Darkness (s), Ultravision\nLevel 4: Nothing that can't be wanded\nWands:\nLvl 2: Ultravision, Invisibility, Barkskin, Flame Weapon, Aid, Eagles, Cat's, Barkskin, See Invisibility, Knock\nLvl 4: Summon IV, Improved Invisibility, Lesser Spell Breach, Stoneskin, Evards, Shadow Conjuration (darkness/mage armor), Freedom, Death Ward, Restoration, Flame Strike, Hammer of the Gods, Dismissal, Elemental Shield, ILMS\nScrolls:\nLvl 2: Flame Weapon (17), Greater Magic Weapon (15)\nLvl 4: Nothing that can't be wanded\n</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
