      "content": "<div>Looks pretty strong GDL<br/>\nI think the Str 14 is an excellent idea for encumbrance if you are going heavy armor + tower<br/>\nRogue would be a decent alternative choice to Monk if you are happy to give up the discipline skill / deflect arrows / monk speed<br/>\n(You will want to have a free hand to deflect arrows, if this is intended which means either unequipping your weapon or shield)<br/>\nIn terms of second cleric domain, Healing Domain is a good option, to make healing potions and cure scrolls/wands 50% more effective, my healing domain cleric is literally giving away 50-70 healing potions to friends due to accumulation and waving around empowered cure critical wands with 50 charges in parties. Unfortunately it doesn't look like you can take both Animal and Healing on WoG but elsewhere it looks like you can.<br/>\nCurious about both Silent and Still.\u00a0<br/>\nI wish the saves were better. A wizard 38 / cleric 1 / monk 1 split could allow you to get Epic Fortitude as a general epic feat whilst keeping everything else. You'd get two extra caster levels at the cost of skill dumps, and the other monk stuff mentioned. Dunno if its worth it<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps, feels like I wouldn't change what you have built except maybe take Rogue instead of Monk but that might just be my preference maybe drop silent for great fortitude but maybe you have some secret strategy in your pocket I don't know about</div>"

      "content": "<div>I wouldn't plan on using Still until much later, probably when I grabbed Auto Still.\u00a0 I would still play as a straight up Wizard.\u00a0 The Silent Spell, in my opinion, doesn't become useful until you open up 6th and 7th level spell slots, so I tend to push those back in a build like this.\u00a0 Regarding Monk Speed and Deflect Arrows, those weren't considered aspects for this particular type of caster.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em class=\"mention\">@Orion2019</em>\u00a0, I too thought about Rogue in this situation.\u00a0 However, with both Wizard, Monk and Cleric classes, he basically has a built in UMD.\u00a0 So I went Monk for the quick Evasion and Discipline investments only.\u00a0 I thought the Discipline made more sense thematically since he can stand in there with highish ACs and fling some pew pews.\u00a0 The Healing Domain won't work in a build like this since he can't even cast a simple Cure Minor Wounds with his 8 Wisdom.\u00a0\u00a0</div>"

You swap animal domain for 2 fighter feats, plus since you're wearing armor Rogue gives UMD at no real cost. The main problem would be making it playable since it only has 2 Rogue dumps (or 1 if you optimise for 40 and start with Rogue).</div>"
