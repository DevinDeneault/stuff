The only build that I've ever seen that uses these two classes in a unique and productive way is Kail's Tear of the Dragon. It's a devcritting epic dodger.<br/>\n<br/>\nA Bard / Blackguard / SD can have the same thing (except Sneak Attack unless you go BG-heavy, but less dice even then) as this build, while making more use of the CHA. Bard 16 BG 4 SD 10 comes to mind. HiPS instead of SA, adding CHA to saves and possibly DM / DS. Just saying that Rogue  Bard doesn't really explore any synergies except tons of skillpoints from these two classes.<br/>\n<br/>\nNormally, when building, if you try to be good at too many things, you end up not being good at all of them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to your comments on your own AB. I don't really consider these numbers very good. By comparison, a Cleric build with over 15 class levels and 20 BAB will have 40 fully buffed, without taking into consideration ability modifier, wf, ewf and ep, plus any other boni from debuffs or enhancement to the combat stat. They could very well reach the mid 50's depending on the build. A Fighter / WM with a scroll of True Strike can reach an AB of 60 easily, for comparison.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs Improved Expertise needed? Only one who plays in Arelith can say. It's environment-dependant. On WoG it's very useful if you can afford it. Not more than Craft Wand, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

I think Rogue doesn't benefit from Bard levels (I doubt anyone would ever build a Rogue without UMD) except to have access to RDD, PM or AA, and maybe Taunts (although there are better options for that purpose). RDD is disabled in Arelith, I think I read it somewhere, and in this build he isn't going for any of the above classes. As for Bard multiclassing as a Rogue, Evasion and Uncanny Dodge can be very nice to have, so you have a point there. <br/>\n<br/>\nSorrel, I would change the spread of your first build (the Rogue-heavy one) to Fighter 8 Rogue 19 Bard 3. That way you get one more feat as a Fighter. Then you can have Improved Expertise as a bonus feat still in pre-epic (by going Fighter 6 Rogue 14 pre-epic) and free up an epic feat to take Armor Skin and gain 2 AC, which works well with Epic Dodge, losing just 1d6 SA and a few skill points.<br/>\n<br/>\nI imagine epic skill focus bluff is for RP, but were it not there, you could also add Improved Sneak Attack to \"recover\" that 1d6 SA that you'd lose by swapping 2 Rogue for 2 Fighter. There's not much point in taking Ambidexterity before TWF, so why not take Weapon Focus there and delay Ambidexterity to the 18th level when you start getting the TWF feats. You'll have +1 AB for 9 levels and lose nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to go now, when I get back I'll critique the Bard one.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hail, Sorrel.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow it's time to talk about that second build. I don't see why you're going for TWF feats with focus in Rapier. Rapier is a medium weapon, so you'd have to wield a small or tiny weapon in your offhand. I recommend you just drop the TWF feats and take Weapon Focus and Specialization, anticipate Lingering Song and take Epic Weapon Focus with that feat. Also, Craft Wand can come much earlier for Ambidexterity. you're taking too many pre-epic feats in epics in a lvl 30 non-WM build and that's never good. You should have enough feats to accommodate your needs. Extra Music with 16 Bard levels is a little bit redundant and if you follow my next suggestion, even more so. Also, you should try to get Extend Spell and up that CHA to 16, which you suggested yourself. And try to get your hands on some CHA gear to make those lvl 6 spells available. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe spread is pretty optimized, but I wonder, if you're going for a singer, why not forget about Crippling Strike and go with Bard 23 Rogue 3 Fighter 4. That would grant you Evasion and Uncanny Dodge from the Rogue side, plus the access to Lasting Inspiration, which grants you 10 times the duration for the song. The bad side is that you might need to be content with 3 attacks per round without twf and with 15 pre-epic BAB so as to have access to EWS. That last attack will probably miss most of the time, so I wonder if it's not better this way.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just a couple of thoughts and options that IMO will improve the builds a lot. You're getting somewhere with them, and by the end I think you'll be quite satisfied.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

To retain the ability to disguise the Bluff ranks have been moved to Perform which is more easily buffed with equipment. Not ideal since the character becomes a master of disguise overnight, but it's still a good option. Spellcraft dropped from 30 to 28 since I hadn't taken INT bonus into account.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hail, Sorrel!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the build I came up with. I relinquished Crippling Strike, 3d6 SA and Stealth skills, and got Lasting Inspiration, Extend Spell, Taunt (which works great with Expertise) and Craft Wand, leaving the epic spells to be taken in epics. You can also drop Epic Prowess for Epic Skill Focus: Taunt for even more Taunting prowess. Also, since your AB is only average, I thought KD and IKD would be less useful for him, so I dropped them too.
