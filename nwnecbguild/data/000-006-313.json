I understand your point, but I've played them both ways, and I gotta tell ya it doesn't really make that much of a difference. Using traps and having Evasion IMO takes precedence, at least where I play. Lots of rock-hurling enemies.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Granted, some servers have customized domain selection, nerfing some, banning some, twinking others... but my own selection is pretty straight-forward, based on what I consider the most generally-beneficial advantages of each for cleric 15 or higher:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Permahaste available on items, arcane multiclass, UMD?  No: choose Travel domain.  Else, continue...<br/>\n2. Imp Invis available on items, arcane multiclass, UMD?  No: choose Trickery domain. Else, continue...<br/>\n3. Ability boosting (AC, AB, HPs, saves, etc.) critical to build integrity ?  Yes: choose War domain. Else, continue...<br/>\n4. Divine Power a staple of the build (AB, APR)?  Yes: choose Strength domain.  Else, shoot craps  <br/>\n<br/>\nWith the deity contingencies, these supposed manicured choices can become skewed by the server you play and would need to be modified accordingly.  In those cases, it would probably be helpful for other builders to understand the specifics of the customizations to make an informed recommendation.  You may need different builds for different servers.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Slippery Mind has nothing to do with rerolling missed fort saves and only does with those Will saves vs. mind-affecting (compare fear auras/spells) which can be rerolled.  The fact that you get a reroll means you can still roll a 1 with Slippery Mind... it's not an immunity.  Clarity is an immunity effect and therefore involves no dice roll which means its a better protection against mind-affecting than anything that alters the Will save vs. m-a.  So is Protection from Alignment vs. Evil/Good.<br/>\n<br/>\nA rogue can take as many Improved Sneak Attacks as bonus feats as he wants up to an additional +10d6 beyond his character-level sneaks.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Actually, Hip, the thing I was talking about with Foojin when we discussed this build is that he was trading something very good for a shitty feat (Undispellability for Slippery Mind). IMO not even an ISA feat would justify not going Cleric 26 Rogue 13 Monk 1 and being immune to Greater Dispelling. You lose 2d6 SA damage (end up with 9d6) and gain the benefit of not worrying about your buffs being striped off except in places where Mord's is available. And let me just clarify here that Foojin plays on WoG, or at least used to, where default AI has been modified so that from a certain point on, every place you go there are mobs that will cast Greater Dispelling on you. Basically, the WoG custom AI makes it so that spellcasters have a much more intelligent way of using their spells, so pretty much every caster uses either Greater Sanctuary or Greater Dispelling as their first cast spell.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

IMO not even an ISA feat would justify not going Cleric 26 Rogue 13 Monk 1 and being immune to Greater Dispelling.

Xylo's was a better build... on WoG or elsewhere... IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy main focus in the commentary was to dispel *no pun intended LOL* the potential usefulness of Slippery Mind in a cleric build.  You should already be familiar about how much I value \"Undispellability\".  And with the key rogue level total being 13 for ED, except for the skill points and dump opportunities, the remaining levels can be better used as you've outlined.  BTW, I was never much of a player who depends on sneaks for damage as many worlds I've played had scores of sneak immunes lurking.  But have become a fan of ED since its true dynamic in-game was explained to me   .<br/>\n<br/>\n(Though, granted, it is OT in this build thread with apologies to foojin, since I (hopefully) have your attention... PLEASE check all the links in your posts that were intended to connect to ECB INTERNAL pages.  There was a restructuring by forumer during your absence that broke them all and members have been gradually repairing them, myself included.  Repeat...  Only those that refer to internal pages in the New ECB need be addressed. Thanks, amigo!)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
