Therefore, I would like to request that the continued validation, maintenance &amp; updating of the ECB Guild Filter be the responsibility\u00a0of someone else.\u00a0With his unique skillset, detective mind and dedication, I believe Orion2019 to be an obvious and excellent candidate for the task.\nFurthermore, Valerfor suggested we scrounge the \"Unfinalized Builds\" and attempt legalizing them. I believe this warrants further discussion.\nECB Guild Archive:\n\n\nWith the above model, work on the ECB Guild Filter and Archives can happen independently. Whenever the Filter is updated, you just pop the new one into the Archive folder and run BuildIndexer.exe and everything should get synchronized. It also means that if I ever leave the project keeping everything updated will be trivial for my successors.\nI will keep this thread updated with any news.\nUpdate:</details>\n<strong>Update Aug 18</strong><br/>\nBeta version of the Archive is now available here:\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/other/tool/ecb-guild-build-archive-v2\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://neverwintervault.org/project/nw ... archive-v2</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Project description:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nThe new Epic Character Builders (ECB) Guild Archive Search Engine, powered by The ECB Guild Filter.<br/>\nThe Epic Character Builders Guild has been running since 2002 and has had over 2000 contributors. This search engine is designed to assist Neverwinter Nights 1 players to help players find character builds that suit their play style.<br/>\nThis is a beta version uploaded to gather feedback from the community. It encompasses all finalized builds from 2010 and onwards. At the moment, it's a glorified search engine - no builds are archived yet. It is still possible to use it as a superior search engine when looking for builds. Local archive will be implemented in the near future.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsage:\n<ol>\n<li>Download and unpack \"ecb archive v2.0b.zip\"</li>\n<li>Open ecba.html</li>\n<li>Search filters are expandable. Enter criteria and click 'filter'.</li>\n<li>Builds will show up on the right. Builds are external links to their ECB Guild forum posts.</li>\n</ol>\nFeedback is\u00a0very\u00a0appreciated. Whatever you can think of - layout, appearance, wanted features, bugs - please let me know.<br/>\nFull credit goes out to HipMaestro and Stagmeister for creating the Guild Filter. Orion2019, Valerfor, Mick Dagger and many others for help with collecting newer builds. Special thanks to Orion2019 for help with this description and general feedback.<br/>\nEnjoy!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Enjoy!</strong><br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary><span class=\"inline-attachment\">\n<dl class=\"fileimage display\">\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/201908/10759108_f620b74fa902bb37296336204b7e7dba_t.png\" />\n</dl>\n</span></details>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Update Aug 4:\nLike this\nNow like this\n----\nNeat!<br/></details>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Update Aug 5:\nImplemented hiding of filter categories.

I'm a big believer in teamwork and it would be nice if we can free you up to do what you need to do with your unique skills.\u00a0Let me know if you wanted me to take over data entry whilst you work with your programming skills on the new search engine. RE ongoing maintenance it's probably best to let the ECB moderators decide, perhaps once the project is complete but of course I'm interested in helping out if real life permits. I put the search strategies I used for google and the tapatalk forum on <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/auto-cbc-create-cbc-character-sheets-from-text-t2355123-s10.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">page 2</a> and <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/auto-cbc-create-cbc-character-sheets-from-text-t2355123-s20.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">page 3</a>\u00a0of your thread so that can be re-run by someone else at a later date if I am unavailable.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Like its nice to know what Dex based builds are out there, and how good they look :)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of the skills and feats in the dataset are nice to include too in the search function (but not all of them). Some of the ones I think are valuable include:<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><div>Devastating Critical, Deathless Mastery, Divine Might, Divine Shield, Dragon Shape, Epic Dodge, Epic Damage Reduction, Epic Mage Armor, Epic Warding, Epic Traps, Hide in Plain Sight, Lasting Inspiration, Multiple Weapon Foci, Smiting focus, Taunting focus, Terrifying rage, UMD,\u00a0Zen Archery</div></blockquote>\n\nAnyway in the end this is your work but I am somewhat anxious to drop some suggestions before your vacation has ended as we will lose access to your skills! maybe the others will have suggestions too or disagree/agree with what I have written and I welcome any other commentary RE the search function!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I use Mozilla firefox and have Win10.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the filters<br/>\nThe class levels: The three boxes with min/max level 0-40 are good.

I don't understand what goes where.<br/>\nMinimum final abilities looks good.

This is the first weekend I've had since posting the Beta with actual time to do creative stuff, so I'll see how much I can get implemented in the next few days.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><div>The drop down menus should be in alphabetical order, perhaps with base classes listed first.</div></blockquote>\nYeah, I agree. This is due to me loading stuff directly from the ECB filter and storing it in an unordered data structure (hash table) - it's easily fixed but takes some time to do it manually and I wanted to release the beta before school/work happened.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><div>Minimum combat vitals: It just looks confusing. I don't understand what goes where.</div></blockquote>\nIf anybody could help me with making this more clear that would be great. Here's what the stuff means:\n<ul>\n<li>Ranged AB - Minimum naked ranged AB in finished build. (lvl 40, 30, 20, free)</li>\n<li>HP - Minimum Hit Points in finished build.</li>\n<li>Naked AC - Minimum naked AC in finished build</li>\n<li>Melee AB - Minimum AB in finished build.</li>\n<li>APR - Minimum attacks per round in finished build.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><div>I was not able to look for a build with sneak attack and knockdown.</div></blockquote>\nSneak attack is not a feature in the ECB Filter excel file - it of course can be extrapolated (Rogue levels, BG levels), but I think that's further down the line. Knockdown I will have to look into.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>\u00a0Xp penalty is just wrong: 309 builds with 40% penalty, 306 with 20%, 251 with 0% and 310 with any!\u00a0</div></blockquote>\nIt's 40% or <strong>lower </strong>since\u00a0I thought that would be most common use case. What has happened to that one build (309 with x&lt;=40%), I do not know. Again, if anybody is skilled at communication, and can help with concise descriptions I would greatly appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\nE, figured out a solution: The answer is check boxes.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>Primary attack looks good except for hybrid builds.\u00a0They seem too loosely defined. There are builds without caster levels and builds with only one level</div></blockquote>\nAbsolutely agree with this - what should we do?<br/>\n<blockquote><div>Characterization has a very long and seemingly incomplete list of different skills and feats.\u00a0</div></blockquote>\nI agree, but that's what's available in the filter. I just loaded everything for convenience, but I think it should be either trimmed (easy) or expanded (time consuming, would have to expand the ECB Filter for that.)<br/>\n<blockquote><div>I struggled with understanding many of the abbreviations, so I recommend that you use the full words. The \"1.69 legit\" does not work, nothing shows up.</div></blockquote>\nYeah, that's the ECB filter being loaded directly. I agree with you and will change it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso happy to see it works with Firefox (even with the shortcut issue.) It also works on Chrome. I tried it on IE and it was completely broken, which is confusing because I tried to make the thing to support multiple browsers. Luckily no one (of worth) uses IE hehehe.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's probably still a few builds missing - Spellsword of Bahamut is iconic, so funny that that one should be missing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em class=\"mention\">@MentalDekay</em>\u00a0<br/>\nThat's a mental fart on my part, hah, thanks for catching it.

In the past I've learned and forgotten how to <strong>deal</strong> with MANY* languages. But I can't <strong>create</strong> with any of them. The best I can do is take something close to what I need and change it slightly to make it work (imperfectly) for me. That and use a debugger. It's what I did with your HTML and JavaScript files. I cribbed the doctype thing from an online programming tutorial which said it's required in HTML4 (tho optional in 5). Then put it together that IE is so old it's probably not HTML5 compatible/compliant. .. Not to mention seeming to recall articles complaining about MS's ability to adhere to the standard. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe connections I couldn't make revolved around how to get IE/HTML to accept that the JavaScript functions were defined in the HTML header. My next thought is that it looks like a dependency issue, but I don't know if that's true.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this said, I'd hazard to guess that Perl and regular expressions would do exactly what you need for old builds. But maybe not tho if the formatting is not consistent enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I thought it'd be helpful, sure.

Moreover each number is displayed in text format instead of numeric</span> --&gt; EDIT: fixed, uploaded updated files</li>\n</ul>\n\nLet me know if there are corrections to be performed <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: found two errors, one of them relates to two halfling builds listed in the same row (check sheet \"errors\" for additional details).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Hopefully this will stop effort duplications, while also letting us work backwards if something pokes through from the Upside Down.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
