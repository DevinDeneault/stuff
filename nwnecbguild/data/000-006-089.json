      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hail, Mighty ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\nA while back, <em class=\"mention\">@kfor85</em>, <em class=\"mention\">@TheSquid</em>\u00a0and myself started working on a spinoff or addendum to my Arcane Spellcaster guide. In it, I mentioned this class combo in the Dual-caster Spellsword section, and then Kfor85 approached me with the idea to explore this class combo more deeply in a guide. I had mentioned it was the most powerful class combo in Neverwinter Nights, and he played a build using this class combo on WoG, and was impressed with its effectiveness. So, we invited TheSquid, who has also published his own adaptation of this build in the NWN workshop and we started discussing and writing. Although the guide is still underway, we were able to define that there are 3 main facets that make this class combo OP: Archery (through Zen Archery), Casting (both classes use Wisdom), Meleeing (Druids have their shapes, Clerics have their buffs, Monks add Wisdom to AC, give Cleave for free and UBAB).<br/>\n<br/>\nThen, each one of us took up the task of coming up with a build focusing on each of these facets: Kfor85 built the Caster, TheSquid built the Archer, and I built the Meleer, which is this build. To focus on meleeing, I wanted to have more Druid than Cleric levels, and the domains are focused exclusively for self-buffing. We have STR for 2 levels of Divine Power, as well as the STR domain power, and War for Cat's Grace and another source of Aura of Vitality, as well as the War domain power. 24 Druid levels do 3 things for this build: give a bonus feat, allow Owl's Insight to cap Wisdom alone, make all your Druid buffs (which are the defensive ones) undispellable in Vanilla NWN and virtually so in EE (5% chance). You can use Air Elemental Shape for those situations where Dragons can't fit through doors. Weapon Finesse makes it MUCH more useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously, I chose to focus primarily on shifting, hence my feat selection, the secondary focus was on Casting, and I chose to completely neglect the Archery aspect, because Druids and Clerics have access to limited options in ranged weapons. However, Zen Archery could be included in this build quite easily, if one so desired. There are in fact 3 feats that could be dropped for it: Improved Critical, Weapon Finesse, and Empower Spell. It's mostly personal preference which one you drop. Improved Critical allows you to crit on 19s and 20s, which is only 5% more, but the bonus damage is quite amazing, and you have 8 attacks per round if fully Hasted, buffed and Flurry of Blows active. Weapon Finesse allows your Air Elemental shape to be your go-to when you need to be immune to criticals and also when your Dragon can't walk down narrow hallways and stuff. And Empower Spell offers spellbook management, but also isn't vital to the concept.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's talk about the build's Strengths and Weaknesses:<br/>\n<br/>\nStrengths:<br/>\n<br/>\nBest AB-to-AC-to-Damage proportion in the game<br/>\nHigh spell DCs (especially Conjuration)<br/>\nImproved Summons (where applicable)<br/>\nEasy to level until mid-epics (all Druids are)<br/>\nDragon Shape at level 33, which isn't the earliest possible, but not bad all things considered.<br/>\nCan set Deadly traps, except Gas<br/>\n<br/>\nWeaknesses:\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nExtremely dispellable on the Cleric side, and getting dispelled while shifted is a PITA, cuz you need to de-shift to rebuff<br/>\nVulnerable to KD or any other combat feats, like Called Shot (you don't have Discipline)<br/>\nVulnerable to immunities, Conjuration is the school that is most affected by immunities, especially Freedom<br/>\nMatures late, hard to play in mid-epics, only gets Monk at 37, so requires caution and smart decisions before then<br/>\nDoesn't have access to level 9 Cleric spells, which is a shame with such a high Wisdom, but something had to give.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, without further ado, here's my interpretation of this old classic!<br/>\n<br/>\nCleric(15), Druid(24), Monk(1), Human<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 8<br/>\nDEX: 14<br/>\nCON: 10<br/>\nWIS: 18 (32)<br/>\nINT:

His build is different and has some weird choices in my book:<br/>\n<br/>\n- He goes for Monk 1 pre-epic to make the build more playable, but it's not really necessary, as playing Druids with their summoned creature squad is hardly an issue, as long as you don't shift.<br/>\n<br/>\n- He goes for a different class split, which is totally fine, getting access to level 9 spells on both classes (a definite plus), but he doesn't get the Spell Focus feats to accompany that class split. I'd use his class split on a more caster-oriented build, with different feat choices.<br/>\n<br/>\n- He gets Zen Archery, which I think is good and makes his build more well-rounded, but at the same time it comes at the cost of Spell Focus, which I don't necessarily think is a good tradeoff. In his build, I'd trade Expertise for Spell Focus, Improved Critical for Greater Spell Focus, and Armor Skin or Epic Prowess for Epic Spell Focus. It doesn't make sense to me to have a 20/18/2 class split without these feats, but YMMV.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Just to illustrate why I went with this class split. I think the most annoying and dangerous thing that can happen to a build like this one is losing its defensive buffs, which will mostly come from the Druid spells. Sure losing your offensive buffs is annoying, but it's less dangerous. You can hang in there much better if your Premonition, Barkskin, Death Ward, Owl's Insight are safe from dispelling, even though it'll take you longer to kill things. Losing Premonition, Barkskin and Owl's Insight, or having to rely on both Owl's Wisdom and Owl's insight for the chance to cap Wisdom (with a 25% chance of rolling a 1 and not capping it) was not something I wanted to deal with in a build that's supposed to focus on the Shifting aspect primarily and on the Casting secondarily (even though you'll be casting more than shifting for most of your life). Again, it's all a matter of preference, and I think it's really cool that this class combo can offer so many alternatives to those who take the plunge and build with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I didn't say this was the most powerful build, I said it was the most powerful CLASS COMBO. The synergies between these classes are simply too many, the deeper you look, the more you find, and there is no other class combo that can reach not only this level of combat stats on its own, but just get so much usefulness from each of the feat choices impacted by Wisdom. That is what I meant. You take ESF in a school and you have access to 2 full divine spellbooks (not in this build because I focused primarily on Shifting, but on Valerfor's interpretation or in Kfor85's Caster archetype, which he hasn't posted) and high DCs on both of them.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThen you have the fact that Druids can shift to fight in melee, but their AB isn't as attractive in early and then again in late epics without some cheesing, but then Clerics cover that weakness with their buffs. Just as an example, a typical level 31 Druid will have 39 AB in his Earth Elemental shape. A Cleric / Druid will have something like 52 (39 base + 3 from Divine Favor at Cleric 11, 5 from Divine Power, 1 from Bless, 1 from Aid, 1 from Prayer, 2 from Battletide), which at that level is great, and makes Elemental Shapes MUCH more useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilarly, battle Clerics are not known for having high physical stats, due to the fact they need to invest stat points on Wisdom and a physical stat, but Druid counters that because their shapes override all physical stats, allowing you to invest all stat points on Wisdom without losing any meleeing capabilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of that while getting Monk AC, UBAB, Cleave, Evasion and Stunning Fists from that 1 or 2-level Monk dip.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, you are right about the dispellability issue, but not about losing Wisdom, at least not in 1.69, because part of the reason I chose to go with 24 Druid levels was to avoid that. You can lose your offensive buffs quite easily, but not your defensive ones (except the occasional Shield of Faith, or Shield from the Brooch of Shielding). Barkskin, Premonition, Death Ward, Spell Resistance, etc, are not dispellable by anything other than Mord's.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this clarifies what I meant.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hail, mighty folk of the ECB!<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I explained in the first post, this is a concept build that aimed to get the highest possible combat stats on a Dragon Shape build, not exactly optimized in terms of being well-rounded enough to do anything else. After having leveled it to 38 on WoG, I have a few comments to make about its performance and what could be changed to make it more well-rounded and easy to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first thing I'm not sure about is whether this build would be playable without the improved summons that exist on WoG. Because it only gets 1 Monk dump at 37, that's a LOT of levels of you playing with 30 AC against enemies with ABs in their 40s or 50s. I did it on WoG by combining the use of the Bear animal companion with disabling spells early on, and later, when immunities started to render my tactics less useful, I resorted to letting a summoned creature tank, while I shifted and attacked from the side, fully buffed with impressive stats for 20 rounds, and having the bear coming from behind as well whenever possible. It gets harder and harder to keep the bear alive as you progress, but it does do a LOT of damage if you manage to micro it properly. I'm actually going to write a guide with hints and tips on how to micro summons, as it seems to be a topic about which many people could use a hand. I've seen MANY people not knowing how to properly command their summons, and end up aggroing a horde of mobs towards them. More on that on the guide.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second thing that really jumped to my attention in playing this build was how easily it leveled in pre-epics, and how hard it was to go through those last couple of levels before Dragon Shape. Air elemental Shape (which now with Monk has 69 AC), had 37 AC fully buffed, so I couldn't tank AT ALL. It's perplexing how much immunities affect this build. If the enemies don't have freedom, 3 or 4 well-placed Stonehold spells would just paralyze all enemies, then bear, summon and yourself shifted could tear through everyone without fearing retaliation. But add freedom to the mix and now every enemy fights back, you can't tank cuz your AC is horrible, so you send the summoned creature in first, then follow with yourself and the bear once all enemies have aggroed it, and hope nobody turns to face you or the bear. If they do, you still have KD to try to mitigate damage, but only 4 attacks per round if not hasted, cuz no Monk UBAB yet. And when they have lots of high-level Clerics in one room, you're basically toast. Summons will get Word of Faithed to the ice age and you have no other way to deal with them. Well, actually, what did it for me was Grease, cuz they had really bad Reflex saves, so they couldn't stay upright long enough to cast, but then I had to get them all close enough together that I could spam Grease and keep them KDed while I tore through them with my Earth Elemental shape (no DS yet).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the last thing that I'd like to mention is that, if I were to try to make this build better, there's one feat that would be mandatory IMO: \"Scribe Scroll\" You could potentially drop Weapon Finesse or Improved Critical: Unarmed for it. I know for this build specifically it'd break the concept, but if there is one feat I now see as a MUST for this build, that feat is Scribe Scroll. Then I wouldn't need to use all my level 9 spell slots for summons, cuz I could have 50 stacks of Summon 9 scrolls, cast from them, and then replenish accordingly.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI did learn another way of baiting dispels that would certainly offend most RP-oriented players, but I gotta admit, sometimes it's the only way. It doesn't work for Vanilla, btw. If you have Tony K's enhanced AI, there is a dialogue option where you can ask familiars and companions to scout ahead and engage enemies if they find them. If your companion is buffed, then you can select that option whenever there's a high level enemy caster that would Mord all your buffs away, and have it be the target of the Mord's instead. Very useful in some circumstances. Especially against time-stopping Wizard bosses. This option isn't working perfectly, however, as the companion will sometimes take a few steps then return for no apparent reason. So, you need to be close enough that it walks a little and gets aggroed, but can't be too close so that the enemy spots you, cuz then you'll be the priority target and it won't work. You can try re-issuing the command to see if it walks any further the second time around.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I didn't miss level 9 Cleric spells as much as I thought I would, and the limited duration on Divine Favor made more Cleric levels unnecessary, as I'd need to de-shift after 20 rounds to rebuff anyway. However, if you want a much improved version of this build, drop Weapon Finesse or IC for Scribe Scroll. That will give you SO MANY MORE spells per day to make sure you always have enough between rests. On SP modules, that's not an option cuz of the limited nature of the XP, but in PWs it's definitely a must!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

As a matter of fact, I was constantly getting hit in Dragon Shape before getting the Monk level, but with the 1000 HP, it wasn't super severe. Of course, not being KD-immune it would sometimes be about who had the best initiative and could KD the other one, like it was in the fight with one of Trok's guardians. The man himself was stoneheld easily, but one of his sneaky guards evaded the spell and almost got me.<br/>\nAs for possessing, you can posses familiars, but not companions, and since this is a Druid build, possessing isn't an option for you. I have to say I never tried possessing familiars to bait dispels, cuz I use them mostly for Rogue skills in most builds. Now I wanna try it out LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
