I am pretty new here and just coming back to NWN after many years away so please forgive me if this ends up being a really dumb question/request.<br/>\n<br/>\nA little background on the request. I am not a min/max kind of guy really so I have no doubt this type of build will NOT be some legendary butt kicker.\u00a0 I do however prefer to play characters that I am interested in rather than just what works out to be the best technical build.\u00a0 Basically what I am trying to find out is how viable would a build be that was a Human Ranger with studded leather or straight leather, one that is equally or close to equally proficient with a Long Bow at range as he is with a 2H sword of some kind up close.. I do understand you can't really have the best of both worlds so I know he wouldn't a master of either really but survivable on a PW like WoG, which is where I think I have decided I would like to play online at.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain I am just looking to see if he would be able to survive and if so if anyone has a good starting point as a build it would be very much appreciated.\u00a0 I really do appreciate all the great posts here and thoughtful builds.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks all.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi stardog. I can't promise much myself, but you might want to have a look at Valerfor's Classic Archer (Ranger 32/ Fighter 4/ Rogue 4) as a starter. It's an elf build, but perfectly do-able as human, which will, of course, get an extra feat. Now, it's a Dex build, so a 2-hander might not be the best idea, and if you wanted more than a WF in a melee weapon (from the extra feat), and you didn't mind sacrificing a Favoured Enemy or two, you could drop a few levels of Ranger for Fighter.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can find the build via HipRedux's ECB Guild Filter, which you can get from the Rules and Tools sub-forum.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust an opening thought for you.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">There are ways. <br/>\nI've made more than my share of rangers in my time. They work best when you know the place to play,  because of favored enemies. <br/>\n<br/>\nRanger switch hitters, with light armour, might possibly work better when dual-wielding. I don't have access to my computer, but focusing on melee and going with the Arcane Archer should work good. It has been done before.<br/>\n<br/>\nRanger21 gets you Bane of Enemies. 23 gets you an extra Feat, same as 25 and 26. I would suggest 26, as 25 also improves Favored Enemy damage. Then 1 bard and perhaps as much as 13 Arcane Archer. <br/>\n<br/>\nElf, start with<br/>\nSTR 14<br/>\nDEX 16<br/>\nCON 12<br/>\nINT 14<br/>\nWIS 14<br/>\nCHA 8<br/>\n<br/>\nBoost strength at every turn. I will see what I can do when I get home.<br/>\n<br/>\nSent fra min SM-G950F via Tapatalk<br/>\n<br/>\n<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
