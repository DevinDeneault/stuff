Takes to early epics, and I greatly recommend it. Just don't play it with textures improvements in your override or patch override, otherwise there will be crashes.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Just some brief comments on that, don't have nearly enough time to make a full analysis/explanation, but I've played a lot from these modules &amp; I like them challenging too... <br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Dance with Rogues</span>: Good (especially for its time) but has lots of virtual sex, so don't have kids around. Lot's of rogue-like quests.<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">The Beholder modules</span>: Good graphics (push this ancient engine to its limits) but the story is very basic &amp; the final fight super-tough. Not recommended.<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">MTS</span>: Good for a quick weekend play, easy to finish, lots of boss-monsters. Lots of fighting. Very basic scripts, once you have the right immunities, you just watch the show. <br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sands of Fate</span>: Epic Egypt, lots of monsters, basic story, a ton of items &amp; some special enemies that ignore immunities. Super-high magic, class-abilities become irrelevant, some old-school Gygaxian traps in there, lots of nostalgia. Eh, play it, although its nothing special. <br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Aribeth</span>: I don't like the writing, contrary to what most people say, she is very spoiled, a single mistake &amp; she is bye-bye, forcing a reload. Not recommended. <br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Lord of Terro</span>r: Make sure you install the optional music pack too. Play a Paladin. Have your volume turned-up. Enjoy the fights &amp; the awe-inspiring voice of Michael Gough. <br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Saleron's Gambit</span>: Very good. The story is top-notch. Levels are low but everything that you do feels important. Highly recommended. <br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Tournament of Champions</span>: Make a Pale-warrior or you are going to regret it... Good for an evening's play &amp; some instant high-level action. Enter the module &amp; customize the gear &amp; feats of your opponents to create any ECB builds that you like &amp; then go &amp; playtest them. <br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">The Arena of Champions</span>: The \"advanced\" version of the previous one. Actual story-line, lots of options for the fights, place bets &amp; have two teams of epic warriors fight. It comes with an actual builds-manual. Nothing as good as actual ECB builds but the effort alone is worth it. Tons of scripting, &amp; lots of fun. Avoid getting Dev Crit in that for the optimal challenge, otherwise, it gets too easy. Also, avoid taking your weapons to the max (+20), for the same reason. This was the module that Kail back in time tested the Jormungandr &amp; actually beat the first two fights (without gear). <br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Adam Miller campaign</span>: Good, old-time classic. Goes up to 18th-level. Worth it even today, I think. <br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Almraiven &amp; Shadewood</span>: Yeah, the story is good. Yes, the magic feels very realistic. Yes, the tilesets are fine. Is that good enough? Not for me, it is slow &amp; with little action. In general, I do not like these hyper-realistic d&amp;d games. Strangely, although Saleron's Gambit is also \"realistic\" it has lots more action &amp; feels totally fine. I would stick with Saleron's for this. <br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Bastard of Kosigan</span>: Can't remember much but I remember it is good. It is actually middle-ages Europe. Three parts module. <br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">A Hunt through the Dark</span>: Play a Drow, seven-part series, some good fights but old design that shows its age. Average. <br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Honor amongst Thieves</span>: A rogue-mainly module. Not enough of them around. Old but classic. Goes up to medium levels. I would play it again. <br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Siege of Heavens</span>: It is just some instant level-forty action against set encounters but they are custom &amp; have their own unique properties. Good scripting but not exactly ECB testing material. I would stick with the Tournament &amp; Arena of Champions for testing ECB builds. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some other good modules/series of modules, like the <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Blackguard</span> series (up to 24th-level). Keep an eye on them, too. Back in the day, I would also playtest entire PW's alone or with some friends but unless they have some really good scripting I would stick to modules. Something else to keep in mind. You would want to install Tony's AI before you play any single--player module (except perhaps, Swordflight), otherwise, with your current experience they would be easy for you. Heck, they would be easy even <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">with</span> Tony's AI but its better than nothing. Yes, Tony's AI has its downsides, yes it's unnatural for cows to try &amp; hide from sight &amp; yes, it will make every enemy mage only ever use Bigby's &amp; Isaac's, etc. But it's far better from the standard AI man, I can't stand it as-is, especially for the henchmen. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's all for now, hope it was somewhat useful.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
