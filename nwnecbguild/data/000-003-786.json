Maybe play test it in the Pretty Good Character Creator Module, or any other game testing module you like and post up the results.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's got a base AB of 36 (dunno if this is good for level 30) and avoids exp penalties (dunno if this is important). Fighter would give an extra feat which could be used for improved knockdown.<br/>\n<br/>\nI figured traps are important in PvP so I invested in set trap. Disarming traps depends on the trap score of the setter. Those electrical traps can pack a punch.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you wanted to invest further in traps / parry you could drop two great dexterities for Epic Skill Focus: Parry and Epic Skill Focus: Set Trap.<br/>\n<br/>\nArmor skin and toughness would also be nice to fit in somewhere<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers have done PvP builds / Parry builds / Level 30 cap builds in the past so their comments are going to be very useful.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Rogue(19), Weapon Master(7), Champion of Torm(4), Elf\nSTR: 14\nCON: 12\nINT: 13\n\n01: Rogue(1): Expertise\n03: Rogue(3): Weapon Finesse, {Uncanny Dodge I}\n05: Rogue(5)\n07: Rogue(7)\n09: Rogue(9): Dodge\n11: Champion of Torm(1)\n13: Champion of Torm(3): {Smite Evil}\n15: Weapon Master(1): Blind Fight, Weapon of Choice: Rapier\n17: Weapon Master(3)\n19: Weapon Master(5)\n21: Weapon Master(7): Epic Weapon Focus: Rapier\n23: Rogue(12)\n25: Rogue(14)\n27: Rogue(16): Great Dexterity, Improved Evasion, (DEX=26)\n29: Rogue(18)\n\nSkillpoints: 231\nSaving Throw bonuses: Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +4\nAB (max, naked): 36 (melee), 32 (ranged)\nSpell Casting:\u00a0\n\n\n01: Disable Trap(1), Hide(4), Intimidate(4), Move Silently(4), Parry(4), Search(4), Set Trap(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(3),\u00a0\n03: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Parry(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(7),\u00a0\n05: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Parry(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(11),\u00a0\n07: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Parry(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(15),\u00a0\n09: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Parry(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(19),\u00a0\n11: Parry(1), Save(23),\u00a0\n13: Parry(1), Save(27),\u00a0\n15: Save(33),\u00a0\n17: Save(39),\u00a0\n19: Save(45),\u00a0\n21: Save(51),\u00a0\n23: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Parry(4), Set Trap(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n25: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Parry(4), Set Trap(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n27: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Parry(1), Search(3), Set Trap(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n29: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Parry(1), Search(3), Set Trap(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0</details>\n<strong>Edit:</strong>\u00a0by the way the reason why I have never made a parry build is that so many people have written its a bad idea... so I have never tried...<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso read you are new to NWN.

It simply doesn't work as intended - and I've not heard from EE users that it's been fixed. So I'd drop that like a hot brick.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, PvP is very different from PvM. In PvM, you're making a character that maximizes its strengths and minimizes (or at least mitigates) its shortcomings so your character can survive and best a variety of foes at a variety of levels. PvP very much relies on knowing what type of foe you will be facing. Thus, a massively critting WM would be utterly useless against a Pale Master build, and a Sneaker/HiPser would suffer against a build with True Seeing, a lower level mage facing Spell Resistant Monks ain't going far, and so on. So the builds will vary according to opponents. I think I can safely say that there is no single PvP build that will be able to handle every type of opponent. And that's why we tend not to publish them here - they're somewhat specialized, by their very nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd a quick question for you: is there a particular reason to cap the build at level 30? If so, are there any particular modifications that vary from \"vanilla\" NwN rules? Traditionally, Dexterity builds shine best in high magic environments, so knowing where you'll be playing would also help.<br/>\n<br/>\nI say all this simply to help us in coming up with something appropriate for you, and the more details you can disclose the better - particularly for a bespoke rather than off-the-shelf build.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps.

Drop it. Really.<br/>\nAh, Arelith. I don't know how far you've looked into it, but here's a link to some of the stuff we hold on the PW. <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/arelith-server-info-t515495.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Arelith server info</a>. The two main differences seem to be the ability to award yourself \"Gifts\" at character creation and you need to take 3 successive levels in each new class you take. That can be worked with.<br/>\nI'll confess, I'm a little lost by the \"meta\" stuff, but I'm a great fan of being intentionally difficult and enjoyment, so good on you! I would, however, suggest that NwN offers such a disparate array of build styles and environments (PW or module) that you won't be playing the same way every time you dive in, so every character offers different challenges. I mean, you could <em>try</em> playing\u00a0 a sneaking dexer as a tank (or vice versa), but it really wouldn't go well. Thus, I hope you have progressively more fun as you go on.<br/>\nHow about we just try to get you a good Arelith build for now, rather than a PvP one? Play the game first, then try some player against player single combat when you're a bit more settled?<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
