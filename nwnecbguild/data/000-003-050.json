      "content": "<div>Hello Bravadorado - and welcome to the Guild!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlas, you can only have a maximum of three classes in a legitimate build, and if you want RDD involved then that means you need either Sorcerer or Bard as well, which means you could have either Paladin (which would preclude Bard) or CoT, but not both. And with CoT being a prestige class (you need a BAB of 7+ and a weapon focus in a melee weapon before you can take it), you wouldn't be able to start taking it until at least level 10 with a Bard/RDD, and considerably further along with Sorc/RDD.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry to be the bearer of bad news.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

      "content": "<div>I see FeelsBadMan, I was thinking you could have more like in NWN2. In that case, could I ask for build advice? I'm going to play through both NWN and NWN2, and I want my character to be designed similarly in both games, as if it's the same person. He's either going to be a straight paladin type (Possible multiclasses in Monk/Fighter/CoT/Divine Champion) or a RDD type (Multiclasses in Bard/Sorc/Paladin/CoT/Divine Champion). These are the NWN builds I was looking at <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Monk_1/_paladin_9/_champion_of_Torm_30\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Paladin/CoT</a>, <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Paladin_29/_sorcerer_1/_red_dragon_disciple_10\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Paladin/RDD</a>, <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=2354355&amp;p=10212#p10212\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CoT/RDD</a>, and these are the respective NWN2 builds I was looking at <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn2db.com/build/?2857\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Paladin/DC</a>, <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn2.wikia.com/wiki/Divine_Dragon_Pal%289%29,Sor%281%29,RDD%2810%29,DC%2810%29\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">RDD/DC</a>. Are any of these actually good, or are there better builds I can use? I don't need the best build in the game but I'd prefer if it was optimal for what it is. It seems like a straight paladin type is more defensive and a RDD type is more offensive, is that true or is one strictly better than the other? Do you have any ideas on a good build that can carry over for the most part between the games? I prefer to use Bard to get to RDD btw, since I don't really like the familiars, although I guess the pseudodragon would be okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny ideas? Thanks!</div>"

      "content": "<div>I'll confess that I've never played NwN2 (didn't even know you could have four classes there), but I've just had a peek at the 2 builds you cite above, and both are Aasimar. While I've encountered that sub-race in (initially) Icewind Dale 2, and then as henchmen (although both were women) in a couple of NwN1 modules, it's not a viable race for an NwN1 PC. Thus, we already run into problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nCoT/Pally and AN Other will likely be a sound idea (though not with Bard because of the alignment issues) - classically Fighter or Rogue, although I do love me some Monk: as would Pally/Sorcerer/RDD. It all really depends on what you want from the build - and no, you can't have everything I'm afraid. Regardless, it could well be very difficult to switch one build between the two games, as they do have different rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nA Paladin (or indeed - and maybe particularly - CoT) might seem predominantly defensive, but they're not. They may indeed have great defensive abilities, but the primary Pally attributes are all offensive, only they tend to work best in spurts - a blast of righteous fury followed by some down-time. If anything, RDD was brought in as a more defensive class - no longer would your Sorcerer or Bard be a physical weakling; no more would it need to hide behind the big nasties. So no, one is not strictly better than the other. As ever, it all depends upon how you want to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to familiars and Sorcerers, don't worry about it, they're not mandatory - they'll only come if you summon them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the ball is lobbed back to you...sorry.</div>",

No multiplayer or anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like using smite evil as a nuke for bosses, while being competent still at facing regular enemies without needing to rest before every fight (Even if it only takes 5 seconds). I like the idea of using smites and crits, I also like the idea of having high saves and immunities, I like having both high strength and high charisma, and lots of buffs to apply before fights. I actually like having charisma as my highest stat, but I'm okay if strength and charisma are roughly equal. I like dealing high (burst) damage with pretty good survivability more than having high survivability with pretty good damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nFighter (or monk)/paladin/CoT seems like a good option, as does Paladin (Or CoT)/Bard/RDD. I would like most of my levels to be in Paladin/CoT, with Fighter/Monk/Bard/RDD being obvious \"secondaries.\" I play paladins in most games, so I like them a lot, and I especially like their perks in NWN, particularly their spells and getting a Holy Avenger. However, if I'm part RDD, I like the idea of being CoT because of RP reasons (Torm is a dragon rider). I was really hoping I could have 4 classes to add in paladins for their spells and the holy avenger. I like Bard over Sorcerer, since adding a little swashbuckling and music to my character is never a bad thing. Sadly I don't like a lot of the Bard spells besides Bard Song and the ability score buffs. I think the RDD is really cool for the immunities and other bonuses, and it seems a lot more interesting than adding fighter or monk levels tbh. I don't actually like the dragon wings though lol, I wish it didn't have those or I could change the color.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I said, the builds between the games just need to have a similar flavor with similar classes, they don't need to be exactly the same, so the level differences don't matter to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes any of this help narrow down a build? Thanks for the help.</div>"

I've been reading around trying to understand things a bit more. With your build I get DevCrit to deal with the trash mobs, and massive smite crits for bosses. Good strength and Charisma, whereas other builds tend to go for one or the other. I also learned that I can hide the gross dragon wings with a cloak, which I didn't know about. And apparently you can use a Holy Avenger on any character so long as you have 25+ UMD? It does prompt me to ask though, is Holy Avenger a top tier weapon? I know it's pretty much the best thing in tabletop DnD, but I don't really know how the forge enchantments and stuff work in HotU. You say in your build that the weapon can be anything and that the axe is just your preference. My preference is Holy Avenger, followed by Enserric, and then Desert Wind? I like Bastard swords in theory but none of the ones I see listed on sites really appeal to me, though the sites might be incomplete. If I use a non-exotic weapon in your build that means I get an extra feat right?<br/>\n<br/>\nI do think I'll miss the paladin immunities, abilities, spells, and divine might/shield, but I guess I can't have everything.</div>"

      "content": "<div>No, afraid not - I was just as frustrated by that as you during my early playing (and I am a single player who hasn't yet become involved in persistent worlds). So yes, you could look at the mid-epic builds, but I really would suggest you download Aielund (free from the NwN Vault, and dead easy to install - even me, who is more than a little technologically challenged, as others will attest, found it straightforward). It's a much better story arc with some great henchies who won't let you down, and it will get you to about level 36/7. As far as I'm aware, the Sands of Fate modules I mention above are the only way to get to level 40 in single player mods, and it means playing the original game or expansions first, so that might appeal.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know if you know this either, but Shadows of Undrentide and Hordes of the Underdark, while following on from each other, are not meant as follow-ons from the original campaign. The idea is that you start SoU as a level 1 character, rather than importing your level 18 one from the OC. I didn't know myself the first time, and was mightily miffed to only get 47xp for killing a dragon I can tell you! You can do the OC and then HotU - there will be some disjunctions, but it's do-able.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, my advice would be to download Aielund, Aribeth's Redemption and Sands of Fate from the Neverwinter Vault, rather than just go for a shorter level build.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just keep on bringing bad news - I'll have to walk around ringing a bell soon.</div>",

      "content": "<div>The full campaign in Nwn1 goes up to 27th to 28th level. There are only a handful of modules that go beyond that range, because DnD in general breaks down at epic levels. This is a fundamental flaw in the original DnD rules and not of Nwn's. Having said that, the quality and enjoyment you get from a module has little to do with it's maximum level. You are right to want to look at level 30 sub-forum builds, these are optimized better for that range and in general don't wait to power up at the end of the build. So, have a look at these builds in there and see if you like something, if not then we can make a Paladin suited to your needs, unfortunately the less levels you have to work upon the harder is to get many things in one build as you have guessed by now. The Holy Avenger sword is a very good (if not the best) sword that you can get in pre-epic levels, of course since Nwn1 goes up to 40th level there are much better options out there once you get past that point, do not worry you will find them out in time.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other option you have is to go for the Aielund Saga. This is a series of modules that were made after the official campaign and they are generally considered to be the best of the best out there. Having played them, i totally agree with that, Aielund makes the official campaign to look almost childish in comparison but i would still not skip on the SoU =&gt; HoTU campaign. There is much to learn there and it has a sufficiently epic scope by itself. It is also much easier than Aielund or other modern modules and will serve better as an introductory module for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlongside the SoU =&gt; HoTU campaign there is also another and very classic module that is ideal for a Paladin character. That is the \"Lord of Terror - The Diablo Campaign\" and it is basically a faithful remake of the Diablo 1 game in the Nwn1 engine complete with sounds and story. You can find more information about that in the \"Modules\" section. This is also a module that finishes at about the same (27th -28th) level as the HoTU so if you decide you want a character optimized for that range you have multiple options to select from.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, having narrowed down what level about your character is about to end his carrier and the environment that you are going to play him/her, then we can make some critical decisions about the build. <br/>\nFirst of all we can exclude \"Great Smite\" from your build since this is too costly and comes very late to the build to actually matter. You will still be able to deal your regular smites however, so all is not lost.<br/>\nSecondly we will have to exclude \"Devastating Critical\" from the build as well, since that also comes at the earliest of 24th level (thereabout) and in many modules is either not allowed (aielund) or nerfed to the ground because of the type of enemies that you are going to face (Sands of Fate).<br/>\nGood thing that a properly build Paladin has no need from these two to deal with his enemies eh? His combat spells and his Divine Abilities more than make up for the loss of those. Your Paladin's abilities can be further augmented with the aid of Champion of Torm class. CoT has a \"Divine Wrath\" ability that is based on Charisma and since your hero is going to be looking \"Heavenly good\" he is a natural choice for this combo. As a natural third choice comes the Fighter to gives us his Weapon Specialization ability but in truth we do not need him because we are going to do a lot of damage with our buffs and divine might, so instead we can opt for Monk. Apart from giving our Holy warrior a more sophisticated look he can gives us better armour class as well. You see Monk can use some special equipment that normal warriors cannot use (Sun Soul boots) and with him being profficient in the use of \"Tumble skill\" we can expect at least 5 more AC till 27th level. What best Monk will also gives free cleave as a feat and the much needed evasion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you see, i am advising a (Paladin/ Monk/ CoT) for your Holy warrior and for a good reason. Forget \"Torm\" in the name of the class, it can be any other God's name as you RP it. The class is very good to combine with your Paladin, same with Monk or Fighter. But i am afraid i talk too much and i might confuse you with explanations you do not need to know from now. Give it a thought and decide what you are going to play then give us your feedback and we will make the best we can.<br/>\n<br/>\n~~ Swords, not words!</div>"

I probably won't do the modules, mostly because I wanted to play NWN to play NWN, not something other people added on, even if it's good. There's other games I could play, such as NWN2, instead. I might check out the diablo one, but it sounds like I would make a new character for that anyway. So I think you're right on the level 30 builds, that's less to worry about build wise anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the class advice, it is probably a good idea to keep it simple. Are the sun soul boots very good? I remember seeing them the last time I played a long time ago, but I also remember having boots of speed that gave perma-haste which was incredibly useful. I believe haste also gives AC, is there an easier way to get perma-haste that makes the sun soul boots worth it?<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Monk_1/_paladin_9/_champion_of_Torm_30\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Monk_1/_palad ... of_Torm_30</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThis is the paladin/monk/CoT build I'm familiar with from the wiki, and I believe it's the character I started in my short playthrough forever ago. I don't really like that it starts as Monk level 1, as NPCs in game called me \"Monk\" for the rest of the game if I remember correctly. Is it possible to do either a paladin/fighter/cot or paladin/monk/cot build that takes paladin at level 1 instead of the other class? I'd also like to have a bit more strength than that build has, but I'm not sure it's necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case I think what you're proposing sounds good. The only items I know of that I'd really like to use are the Holy Avenger, the Searing Armor, and the Boots of Speed (Or another perma-haste item). I imagine you're right about the monk being a better choice, if you could show me the build you had in mind that would be awesome. And just out of curiosity, is there any kind of paladin build that dual wields with high crit but doesn't use stealth? I've had fun in other games with something similar to that, might be worth a try here if it's possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all the help!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Having had an albeit cursory look at the build you cite on the wiki, and not a Pally player, I'm not over-impressed by it, but I'll confine my comments more to the Monk areas, where I feel more comfortable (and Empyre and Valerfor will correct any mistakes I make, I'm sure).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reasons the build starts with Monk are entirely practical ones. Apart from getting the Cleave and Evasion feats for free right at the beginning, you get twice the amount of skills points to allocate at level 1 (admittedly only 16 rather than 8), and you get the 4 points in Tumble straight away - effectively saving you a further 4 points - in what is a skill-starved build in any case (only 137). However, I can see a good case for putting it back to level 2, because you'd still get the free feats then and you'd be able to take 5 points in Tumble for +1AC. Regardless, I think only 1 level of Monk is missing a trick - at least 2 levels would be better (I'd probably go for more, but that's just me), with the final one coming late on in the build so you can max that Tumble AC bonus (up to +8) without it costing you twice the amount of skill points.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Sun Soul boots (Monk-specific, given you won't have UMD) are excellent. If I remember correctly, in the OC and SoU they cap at +5, but I seem to recall +7s in HotU. Anyway, just focusing on the +5 boots, they not only give +5 to AC but also +2 to DEX, which is another +1 to AC, so that's +6 in total, which is immense. There are indeed other perma-haste items out there (a chain mail comes to mind), and Rizolvir (a smith in the Underdark and again in Cania in HotU) can add perma-haste to a weapon for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll leave other things to wiser heads than mine.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

If there's a case for picking it up at second level I'd vastly prefer that. I actually also dislike that the build only has one level in monk, but because I think it just feels bad and cheap to only invest one level in a multiclass. If I can take two levels or even a few more that's good with me. After comparing the sun soul boots to the other ones on the website I'm using, they do seem really good, especially if I can get haste elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again.</div>"

This is not an easy build to play in its full potential. This Paladin has three distinct divine abilities, has spells to buff, has knockdown to shut-down enemy spell-casters, has turn undead, lay on hands and even some smites. He can also persuade people and even effectively use medical kits or taunt his enemies to lower their defenses significantly. Do you need to use all these abilities to win your fights? Nah, not even close.

Yeah thats an epic armour that is +5 full plate that strikes back with a low level searing light effect whoever hits you. Its a good one aye but there are better in HoTU, Casie's Soul, The Iron Skeleton, Lesser Golem armour, etc. Still if you liked it as a kid and you are fond of it then you can have it with almost any build apart from those that use Dexterity as thier primary stat and thus need Robes to get the best AC they can. As for the looks you can change how you look within the game and make yourself more comfortable. There are even dyes to change your colors so you look as shiny or menacing as you like.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the DW build, you can have it within 28 levels but you are confusing Smites with criticals. If you want to do a Smite on your opponent that is fine, a Paladin can do that from 1 to 3 times per day just fine. You pop a button and you add for that strike your level to the damage and your charisma bonus to your attack. If this was a critical hit and the creature is not immune to them, then you multiply your (total) damage by the ammount your weapon has. Now this is all well and good but when we here refer to a \"Smiter\" we mean another thing entirely.<br/>\n<br/>\nA <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Great </span>Smiter is one that has taken the epic feats in order to multiply the damage his base Smites do. It can go high, very high. In \"Holy Smiting Dragon\" i take this feat 6 times and that could easily be further optimized to as much as 9 times for a tenfold multiplication of your base Smites damage. In a critical hit that gets multiplied further and you could see even four digit-numbers in a single hit! But, that requires dedication as its pre-requisite is extremely tough. You have to have a base unmodified 25 Charisma before you even can take the first \"Great Smite\" feat. Since your Charisma needs to be that sky-high everything else goes to secondary role and even then it comes late and it is meant to be played in a PW where you can continue playing after you reach high levels. It is also used frequently in high-level PvP, that also happens in PW's since there are only two modules in Neverwinder Nights that permit you to have VHL characters running around and fight other builds. There are also exactly two modules that this can be played, Aielund &amp; Sands of Fate. But this build cannot be done in the short span of just the official campaign there is simply to little room in 28 levels to build a <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Great </span>Smiter.</div>"

I guess it makes me pretty MAD due to the INT requirement, but it seems pretty good for a crit build.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for all this help by the way!</div>"

Dual-wielding requires another 3 feats and a 15 Dexterity too. Those are just the pre-requisites. Then you need the standard combat feats as well in order to be really effective (blind-fight, improved critical etc). A character takes a total of 7 feats throughout his life (in 18 levels) plus 1 more if he is a Human. See now why we need Fighter or CoT as one of the three classes in the build when we plan to take Weapon master?<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, rogues is not strictly better than the bard, just different. Both are equally good.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can also have a look to level 20 sub-forum builds and see if you like something from there. Then play the classic \"plague\" campaign in Neverwinter and make another character for SOU to HoTU campaign. The original campaign is the best to get you in the game, you can expect to reach about level 17 by the end of it and then you can import your character to another module and continue from there.</div>"

UMD will allow you to use the Holy Avenger, but the quest in SoU to get it is only available to Paladins, and there is none to be had in HotU. However, I the encountered Enserric the longsword, and that was a better sword than the Holy Avenger (The Holy Avenger was nerfed in the final patch, 1.69, and Enserric's vampiric regeneration is awesome, and he is a talking sword, how cool!), so basically all I really got out of the one or two Paladin levels was immunity to Fear.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen dual wielding, it is advantageous to use a light weapon in the off hand (one size smaller than you: small or tiny for medium-size races, only tiny for small-size races), and you can see here: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Dual-wield\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Dual-wield</a> Your attack penalty for dual-wielding is lowered by two when your off-hand weapon is light. Unless you want to take the full line of feats for two weapons, you will be using the same kind of weapon in your main hand, which is good if you go for a DEX-based character with Weapon Finesse.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you first encounter Enserric, you can tell him that you don't need a longsword, and he will offer to transform into another weapon. The options are dagger, shortsword, and greatsword, which is great for a dual-shortsword (or dual-dagger) Rogue.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust some things to think about...</div>",

Charisma is my favorite stat in DnD by far. The reason I'm interested in DWing and stuff is when I logged into the new character (Paladin/Monk/CoT) I immediately sighed a little as I thought about the character's progression into the game. While it would be powerful, it wouldn't be doing anything unique or interesting. It's essentially a pure paladin that takes multiclasses for no reason other than a couple defensive perks and extra feats. The multiclasses in the Paladin/Monk/CoT build don't add any uniqueness, just stats.<br/>\n<br/>\nDue to this lack of uniqueness, I considered other characters I had played in previous games or thought of playing in true DnD games. I have a lot of really cool characters. One of my favorites is Firuz Anvari from the game Guild Wars. Firuz is a Paragon/Assassin who wields dual swords, dealing critical hits and constantly supporting the party with the adrenaline/mana he quickly regenerates.<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/p35O85u.jpg\"/><br/>\nSo this is the character I've been thinking of when asking about this current build, but it's probably a bit much to ask for NWN.

You can solve this by picking \"Exotic weapons\" and chose the \"Two-Bladed Sword\" which has the base Dmg of two longswords but counds as a light off-hand weapon thus reducing the penalty to just (-2/-2). <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a weapon with good support from the game and you can find some really good ones in there, such as the \"Sword of Lyons\" or the \"Uthgardt Ceremonial Blade\".

And let's not forget the x1.5 damage from a two-handed weapon.

Monk gives you also Cleave for free which is good for supporting iterative attacks which you will be doing a lot. It chains your attacks in other words. <br/>\nAlso Monk gives you Evasion from the 1st lvl, while Rogue does that at 2nd which in this build comes quite late.<br/>\nThirdly Monk let you get the Sun Soul boots and the rest without spending a single point in UMD, and we don't have enough skill points to do so with Rogue.</div>"

I'll eat the penalty for cool points.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Feats:</strong>\u00a0I'm not sure that Iron Will, Called-Shot,\u00a0Toughness, Expertise, and\u00a0Improved Knockdown are critical in doing what I want this build to do. They can be replaced with other things like Great Cleave, Overwhelming Critical, Great Smiting, or ASI's. If some of these feats are taken just due to them being fighter bonus feats, then I'm okay with the build taking less fighter levels and more CoT levels (Less feats I don't want and better saves/Divine Wrath).<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you make a Fighter/Rogue/CoT build with these changes in mind?\n</div></blockquote>\n\nI don't want to sound negative here, but I fear I will.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you really asking for a <strong>worse</strong> build, just for the sake of appearances? You won't be able to hear invisible enemies approaching (probably with sneak attacks), resist spells as well, and you'll run the risk of blowing yourself into small pieces if you're not able to find traps (even if you can't disarm them, it's better to know where they are). You'll lose 56 to 84 hit points from the loss of Toughness and CON. And you'll lose 2 AB on each weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and Great Cleave and Overwhelming Critical are really only useful if you're going for Devastating Critical. Great Cleave will tie you into mob fighting while mages and clerics wail on you from afar and Overwhelming Crit only adds a smattering of damage to the build, and is only available in epic levels in any case. Iron Will boosts the meleer's traditional weak point, the save against Will; Improved Knockdown extends the potential for knocking down enemy mages and thereby dispatching them before they can batter you (the chance of which is made worse without points in Spellcraft). Expertise gives you a healthy AC boost when required, and Called Shot either slows your foe or damages their AB (depending on whether you go arm or leg). All of which are better than Great Cleave in my opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, it appears you're looking for something that's more vulnerable to attack - magical and mundane - and less likely to hit whatever you face. I just don't understand. Please, someone, tell me I'm wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nI appreciate that you're looking for your ideal build Bravadorado, but it's about balance. A one-trick pony won't live long enough to demonstrate their particular speciality. Why not try Valerfor's Fighter/Rogue/CoT as is, <strong>then</strong> see what you'd do differently? And we'd all be happy to help with that, should you wish.</div>",

      "content": "<div>I'm not sure of the weight of the stuff you're talking about. For the traps and etc, I plan on having a henchman with me to do most of that. I'm also not so sure that the base game is difficult enough that I need to be too worried about defensive optimization. I beat HotU when I was 10 without using any kind of build at all, so I feel like I can handle what the hell throws at me even with more offensive choices. It's probably different in the level 40 modules but as I said I just want to do the campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I was just pointing out things I prefer, I mentioned that I wasn't sure how it would affect the build. The main thing I'm concerned about is the low charisma score, I'd much rather have that higher than a few extra hit points and some skill points in lockpicking.</div>"
