So any advice would be welcome.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</div></blockquote>\n\nLuck Dragon, an assassin with AB 45 has to be taken seriously.<br/>\nYou achieve that very high AB\u00a0with all the pre epic full BAB fighter levels and the epic bonus feats that let you\u00a0reach G Dex VIII.<br/>\nYou need 13 fighter Levels to be able to x-class the stealth skills to 8 ranks and qualify for assassin. That also gives you an awful lot of pre-epic feats to spend. You spend them on feats for a ranged- and a melee weapon.<br/>\nThe down side of taking that many warrior class levels, is that assassin with the DA damage and paralyzation comes late, and to a lesser degree\u00a0because of\u00a0fewer assassin levels, and has to compete with the\u00a0higher fort saves of near epic targets. The high intelligence compesates some and improves the DC.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I should suggest improvements, I would replace some of the feats and rearrange the order in which they are taken.<br/>\nYou also ask for an opinion on the skills. I will give you my suggestion below.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for feats, I think this character will benefit from IKD for better melee fighting and Rapid shot for better archery. It will also benefit from EWS in both weapons.<br/>\nI don't think you need Called shot much. You use HIPS for crowd control, and are ready to use your rapier in close combat. Iron will is not going to save your abysmal will saves, so drop it. You already have to\u00a0use potions of clarity extensively, or any other mind shielding equipment anyway. You can also live without Toughness when you have\u00a0HIPS and Improved invisibility.<br/>\nDropping those three gives you room for KD, IKD and RS.<br/>\nI suggest that you drop\u00a0two G Dex feats to give room for the two EWS feats. You take EWF on level 21 and 24. That let you take both EWS with the fighter Level on 27.<br/>\nYou improve weapon damage by 4 at the cost of 1 AB. (44 AB\u00a0is still very good in a HIPSing assassin build).\u00a0The extra weapon damage\u00a0can come in handy vs sneak immunes, since this is a dex build.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would take the feats in this order for better playability:\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>\n01: Fighter(1): Weapon Finesse, Point Blank Shot\n03: Fighter(3): Weapon Focus: Longbow\n05: Fighter(5)\n07: Fighter(7)\n09: Fighter(9): Rapid Shot\n11: Fighter(11)\n13: Fighter(13)\n15: Assassin(2): Dodge, {Uncanny Dodge I}\n17: Assassin(4)\n19: Assassin(6)\n21: Shadowdancer(1): Epic Weapon Focus: Rapier, {Hide in Plain Sight}\n23: Assassin(9)\n25: Assassin(11)\n27: Fighter(14): Epic Weapon Specialization: Rapier, Epic Weapon Specialization: Longbow\n29: Assassin(14): Great Dexterity I, (DEX=26)\n31: Assassin(16)\n33: Assassin(18): Great Dexterity II, Great Dexterity III, (DEX=29)\n35: Assassin(20)\n37: Assassin(22): Great Dexterity V, (DEX=32)\n39: Assassin(24): Great Dexterity VI, (DEX=33)</details>\n\nMy suggested skill list is: <br/>\nDisable Trap 1(4), Hide 43(55), Move Silently 43(55), Open Lock 30(42), Search 16(21), Set Trap 1(13), Spot (or Listen) 43(44), Tumble 40(52), UMD 36(35)<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: The bonus to saves vs poison is actually +12. There is a bug in the old CBC sheets that stops it at +6.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

For my playstyle, Evasion alone (at level 22 with SD2) is worth the trade.

The other 2 Fighter levels you can take whenever. If you're going to get Discipline, then spread them out for skill dumps (not that I'm recommending Discipline on a DEX build). Otherwise, it doesn't really make a difference.
