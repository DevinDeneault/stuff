Darkness spells to be always hitting the DA damage, HiPS, EMA and epic warding for defense, and a huge number of instant death spells for those pesky enemies with a decent AC. She is an elf 'cos I like elves and it gets her longbow usage, but apart from that, most other races are viable. Halfling would work well and human's extra feat could get you the weapon proficiency (and more skill points so create traps earlier.) But she was an elf when I played her sooooooo *grin* <br/>\n<br/>\n..........................................................<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#800040\">The Lord is Shadow; I

<br/>\nfor his name\u2019s sake.<br/>\n<br/>\nYea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, <br/>\n  I will fear no evil: <br/>\n    For evil art with me; <br/>\nmy art and thy death

style=\"color:#BF00FF\">Spells</span>: Lots of Phantasmal killer, finger of death, wail of the banshee, darkness, invisibility, true strike, IGMS and the usual buffs<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#BF00FF\">Advantages</span>: Undispellable, master trapper and can create all but the deadly gas trap, HiPS with decent sneaking and invis if that fails, can cast darkness for auto sneak attack damage, full power mage with instant death spells galore and scribe scrolls, and can self haste to 4 APR if no perma haste items giving two death attack paralysis chances in the first flurry, oh and UMD too.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#BF00FF\">Disadvantages</span>: Bloody awful AB, even buffed so true strike, divine power scrolls if you can buy them or go to spells when you can't hit someone. Usual MMM issue so not a biggie. Crafting traps comes late which is a shame (tho you could drop search points for it if that suits the environment better, which it unfortunately didn't where I was playing her). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCan't find any similar builds in the search engine, which surprises me. Usually I build something and then find it already done more or less. Anyway, I am always happy to be corrected so if someone knows of a similar build... <br/>\n<br/>\nComments, crticism and cheeky replies welcome<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#BF00FF\">Have fun </span><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">here's my take.  First, I can't see what Assassin is bringing to the build.  It is a nice Death attack DC but you probably won't live long enough to exploit it much.  I would have gone for Rogue instead.  That would have netted you many more skill points and open lock as a class skill.  Also, with 13 lvls of rogue, I would take either ED or CS and use that to the best.  the 1 SD cheese tactic is old.  I would drop wizzy down to 22 or 23 with rogue at 12 and boost the SD to 5  You get a free feat with that, I believe.  Since your using a pointy ear with this one, the Rogue/wizard combo is a great idea.  <br/>\n<br/>\n   concerning the wizzy lvling here.   I would move Extend to the first feat slot and, if you are still going to go for the silent spell, move it to where you take the extend.  You need that early goose in the timeing with your spells, and taking silent first is non productive since you take wizard for 13 straight lvls.  You have no reason to take the silent that soon in your career.  Extended mage armor, and extended magic weapon (once you can cast that version of it) would do you much more good.  <br/>\n<br/>\n   Quite frankly, I would go with a rogue heavy wizard and kick in some assassin or SD.  With that combo you could easily be slinging spells, and dealing death in short order.  IMO  the assassin class is a bit underpowered in many servers, while the rogue is still holding strong.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If I were to pick a secondary school I'd go with enchantment which often lets you harvest strong allies (mostly meleers which have a weak will save). I'd also like to see craft wand in the build since, let's face it, spells ain't never enough and craft wand lets you spam some pretty nice spells all across the magician's career.

Plus ED needs 25 dex leaving her with a much reduced casting DC. Wizard below 24 means dispellable, which I hate having. I am not sure why you think she won't live a long time. She can dispel anyone's TS, has HiPS, imp invis, DR, EMA and epic warding, spell mantles, fights in darkness and can bigby, not to mention those nasty death spells. <br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>Devlinor wrote:</strong><br/>\n   concerning the wizzy lvling here.

Hmmm, only problem is silent spell gives me another spell level for the single shot insta death spells. I'm probably better dropping maximise spell cos when playing her I am not using maxed IGMS, just a lot of wail of the Banshee. Seems wrong to have a caster without all the metamagic feats tho *grin*.

I mean, ok if the environment has items with SR32, then very good idea for this build to get them, but otherwise, 32 is still too low, no? I normally only bother with SP feats with a lvl 38 caster type so I have a decent chance of getting pure monks.

Net result is 28 AB melee or 29 AB thrown weapons/sling (21 +1 small size +1 wf +2 ewf +3 dex and +1 good aim for thrown weapons/sling) which is not bad at all for a caster build.<br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>shia luck wrote:</strong>Thank you *curtseying* </div></blockquote>My pleasure<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

We'll be doing a levelling up/testing playthrough of the module we are working on soon so I might downlevel her and go that SP route and see how it works out.
