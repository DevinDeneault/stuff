      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hail, Mighty ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\nToday I come to you with my NWN adaptation of Cernd, the Shapeshifter who was caught while investigating animal trouble in Trademeet. TBH with you, he didn't have a colorful personality that you could really draw inspiration from. He was your cookie-cutter, introspective, charicature, \"I do everything for Mother Nature\" Druid. In game terms, he could turn into a Werewolf (and later on a Greater Werewolf), who had a lot of immunities and resistances, which in NWN is perhaps most accurately expressed by either Undead or Construct Shape. So, just in case, he gets both. But, as we all know, leveling up a pure Shifter (Druid 5 / then Shifter from that point on), is unnecessarily difficult in NWN, and Cernd wasn't just a Werewolf. He could remain in Human form, which had terrible stats, and cast with his High Wisdom, healing party members, and kind of performing the role of a support too.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I decided to make him a generic Shifter with access to ALL the Shifter forms, regular, improved and Epic, but I didn't see the reason to focus on one of them specifically, like Undead or Construct shape. But to begin with, he goes pretty high on Druid, which makes him a decent (but not specialized) caster with his high WIS, but no Spell Focus feats. Instead, he gets Weapon Finesse for his DEX shapes, which makes Air Elemental shape much more useful and increases the effectiveness of the Kobold Commando and its epic counterpart. At Shifter 17, he gets the last and important upgrade to his Drow Warrior, Kobold Commando and Lizardfolk Whipmaster shapes. At Shifter 16, he has infinite uses of all his non-epic shapes per day, and gets all Epic Shifter shapes, including, of course, Dragon Shape. He also gets Monk Speed, to walk a little faster than most by the end of his life.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, there are a few things this build does VERY well, but a few things you need to be mindful of:<br/>\n<br/>\n- For the most part, you'll be a sub-par Druid, with fewer spells per day, and the Shifter levels won't be useful for quite some time, so it might be tricky to level him, but it is doable. You just need to be really economic with your resources.<br/>\n- Owl's Insight won't cap your WIS even at level 40, which means you might lose spell slots when shifting unless you have Wisdom on a Helm or an Ioun Stone, or a Potion of Owl's Wisdom, which STACKS with Owl's Insight. This will work most of the time to at least prevent the loss of spell slots when shifting, if not to cap Wisdom.<br/>\n- After you start getting your Epic Shapes, things become A LOT easier, as you'll always have an option of something to turn into for any specific battle.<br/>\n- Be VERY CAREFUL with Dispels and Breaches. Being dispelled while shifted is DEVASTATING to this build, and it WILL HAPPEN. Try to minimize it as much as possible.<br/>\n- Use Invisibility potions and Dusts of Disappearance to try to position yourself before battles. It'll be very difficult to reposition after you engage.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, I think this build is solid. An Epic Shifter build with access to all Druid Spells, Monk AC and Speed, Evasion, Cleave, IKD, and Blind Fight. Unlimited used of all non-epic shapes means you can shift to fight in literally EVERY encounter! This means he won't need Zen Archery that much (and there was no room for it). He also has access to all Epic shapes relatively early: Undead Shape at 31, Dragon Shape at 33 and Construct Shape at 35.<br/>\n<br/>\nLadies and Gentlemen, Cernd, the

Glad you like the build I devised for Cernd!<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout your henchman dispelling you, it is possible if they cast dispel magic or any form of dispel in an AoE effect and you are in the target area for the spell. This is how you potentially dispel Greater Sanctuary in PvP, for example, by casting Mordenkainen's Disjunction on the ground next to where the opponent is standing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not yet posted Keldorn, but I can if you want to see him. Stagmeister and I are working on builds for all BG characters that I didn't get a chance to play with, so he and I are going back and forth with ideas about what would work for different characters.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are the builds we have as of today (some are already posted here):<br/>\n<br/>\n- Aerie<br/>\n- Cernd<br/>\n- Edwin<br/>\n- Imoen<br/>\n- Jan<br/>\n- Keldorn<br/>\n- Korgan<br/>\n- Mazzy<br/>\n- Minsc<br/>\n- Valygar<br/>\n- Viconia<br/>\n- Yoshimo (2 versions)<br/>\n- Xzar<br/>\n- Kivan<br/>\n- Montaron (we're reviewing the last details, but he's almost done)<br/>\n- Kagain (almost done as well)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe above builds are all revised and finished, except for Montaron and Kagain, which are currently in the final stages of being \"fine-tuned\".<br/>\n<br/>\nThen there are a couple of others that we have looked at, but haven't delved deeper into, that I had done in the past, and a few ones we haven't gotten to, yet:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Anomen (not revised)<br/>\n- Nalia (revised once, remade, pending second revision)<br/>\n- Jaheira (not revised)<br/>\n- Khalid (not revised)<br/>\n- Haer'Dalis (revised once, suffering from AP on how to remake him properly)<br/>\n- Sarevok (not revised)<br/>\n- Ajantis (not revised)<br/>\n- Dynaheir (not revised)<br/>\n<br/>\nMostly waiting on Stag to finish up Montaron with my suggested tweaks and get back to me on the \"finalized\" Kagain version I sent him, as well as my second attempt at Nalia. Stag? Where are you, mate? LOL I'm putting all the blame on you!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll post Keldorn shortly. Cheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'll find the relevant thread when I can.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause I'm replaying BG atm (don't ask), just to make things worse, I've started wondering about creating an Elminster and Gorion. And to get things back to a NwN focus, there's always Arin Gend and Nasher, as well as an early version of the lassie running the whorehouse and the pirate boss (struggling with names atm).<br/>\n<br/>\nNeverending Worlds indeed!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
