      "content": "<div>I'm wearing robes at the moment so I doubt its the armor check \u00a0penalty.<br/>\n<br/>\n Its almost like Im getting a -4 instead of + 4 as a dex modifier, its also affecting Hide, Move Silently etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n How do I go about doing a save/load if im playing on a PW ?<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks<br/>\n<br/>\n Edit: \u00a0NVM, I relogged and it appears to have fixed itself.</div>"
