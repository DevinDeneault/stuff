      "content": "<div>I wanted to have a try at making a dual wielding kama weaponmaster on the server I play on, so I iterated on this a few times. Just to get some things out of the way to account for server specific things:<br/>\n<br/>\n- The race chosen is Tiefling (+2 dex, +2 int, -2 cha). The server allows for genasi of all stripes, as well as aasimar and mephlings. Githzerai and Githyanki too, though I decided I wanted to stay at ECL +1 at the most. But for those familiar with the alternatives, and that includes quasi and para genasi, they're on the table.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The server grants Ambidexterity for free after taking Two Weapon Fighting. That's pretty much the only reason I felt comfortable building this on a tiefling, since I give up the additional feat a Human would get.<br/>\n<br/>\n- This could probably be done on a human, but it would require some stat finangling. My initial version of this was 10 ranger/3 monk/7 weaponmaster as a human, so it would work, but I don't think it would be as strong.<br/>\n<br/>\n- I don't have this set out all pretty like everyone else does. Sorry!<br/>\n<br/>\nClass split: Fighter 6 / Monk 6 / Weaponmaster 8<br/>\n<br/>\nAlignment: Lawful Neutral (Although monks are allowed to be nonchaotic there)<br/>\n<br/>\nAttributes:<br/>\n<br/>\nStr: 15 (+5)<br/>\nDex: 16<br/>\nCon: 14<br/>\nInt: 14<br/>\nWis: 14<br/>\nCha: 6<br/>\n<br/>\nSkills:<br/>\n<br/>\nHeal: 23 (+2)<br/>\nIntimidate: 4 (-2)<br/>\nTumble: 20 (+3)<br/>\nSpellcraft: 8 (+2)<br/>\nListen: 23 (+2)<br/>\n<br/>\nUnspent: 24 (if I did my maths right)<br/>\n<br/>\nLevelling progression:<br/>\n<br/>\n1: Monk (Dodge, Cleave, Improved Unarmed Strike, Evasion, Flurry of Blows, Stunning Fist)<br/>\n2: Fighter (Weapon Focus: Kama)<br/>\n3: Fighter (Mobility, Expertise)<br/>\n4: Fighter +1 Str<br/>\n5: Fighter (Weapon Specialisation: Kama)<br/>\n6: Fighter (Spring Attack)<br/>\n7: Fighter (Two Weapon Fighting.

      "content": "<div>Hi!<br/>\nAfter a quick glance on the build:<br/>\nI would go monk 6 / fighter 6 / wm 8, this way the toon gains +1 bab, +1 on reflex saves and 2 hp. The loss of 2 skill points and and the wholeness of body feat is not a big price.<br/>\nYou can't take spring attack at lvl3 because of the +4 bab prereq, you should switch it with expertise.<br/>\nI think you miscalculated the skills somewhere a bit, my cbc sheet says you have 45 points left (43 with my class distribution). I would take full discipline, and a detection skill with the rest. Listen is a class skill for both wm and monk, but the spot is only for wm, so it has less dump levels. Also I would consider drop heal completely, and take some crossclass trapping, so you get an alternative way of killing enemies.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Changing the level to WM doesn't gain me any BAB, so it would only be the +1 reflex save (and 1 more use of Ki Strike). Which is still more valuable than Wholeness of Body, so I'll make that switch.<br/>\n<br/>\nNoted, on the feat ordering.<br/>\n<br/>\nI rough mathed the skill points by hand so there's probably some mistakes there. Taking a detection skill makes sense, though I'm not sure cross classing set trap is going to amount to much. Wouldn't be able to set anything better than deadly traps, and most every boss I would ever try to use them against on that server have and saves high enough to generally ignore them. Evasion isn't that rare either.<br/>\n<br/>\nEither way, updated the initial post with the small changes and tried to math out the skill points again, which should now be correct.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Is the base race for this a half elf or does the server use haks to make Tiefling a separate race at character creation? If it doesn't use haks then you will be missing 4 skill points since your INT doesn't increase to 14 until after character creation, which might account for the skill point discrepancy.<br/>\nAlso. does the Ambidexterity granted by the server count as a prerequisite for ITWF? Sometimes bonus feats do not count as prerequisites for classes or feats and need to be taken anyway, although with haks this might not be a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnto the build, you should lower the starting STR to 15 and increase either CON or INT by 2.<br/>\nThe feats look good, although personally I would move the dual-wielding feats to levels 15 and 18 in order to get Blind Fight and IC earlier. If concealment and invisibility is uncommon on your server then leaving Blind Fight at 18 probably won't be an issue.</div>"

      "content": "<div>It's available at character creation. The Ambidexterity does qualify, as far as I'm aware. If not, that's going to be disappointing (and I think someone would have noted it by now...but I won't know for sure until I get there)<br/>\n<br/>\nBlind Fight is available on helmets, and while not the helmets I would prefer to use in the long run, I can have it provided during the levelling process, so I'm fine with backending it.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrength starts at 16 because there's the vague potential of taking the character to epics (the server allows levelling to 30, though most PCs end up getting stopped at 20 and staying there for their entire career). I guess it would make sense to drop 1 point in this case, still.</div>"
