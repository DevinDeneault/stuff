with an AB of 36, it squeezes in lasting inspiration at 39 and RDD 10 at level 40 with the current split it allows for PM 10 / RDD 10 earlier, with more AB at the expense of LI (which comes late as well), if you're like me and retire characters after 40 then it just enhances playability.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaximillan Kane's\u00a0Cursed Half-Dragon Chanter a Bard 20/PM 10/RDD 10 build is similar to DaMouse404's build in that it tries the LI 39/RDD 10 squeeze but is more offensively focused with Str 38 and AB 43.<br/>\nI chose to take a bit more HP (about 120 more) and leave AB at 42, there are heaps of AC/AB buffs in the build already.<br/>\nI liked the Str 38 in that build which can be capped at 50.\u00a0<br/>\nNice feeling when you see that on the character sheet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway with all that AC sneak/crit immunity it didn't make sense to have EDR III anymore so I dropped it and boosted her offensive capabilities with her spear.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\nJust wondering what you guys think.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dispel issue with the shields previously did bother me, it might be ok in some environments but by going PM I can just forget about them and just have massive AC and crit/sneak immunity.\u00a0<br/>\nIf I want some shields I can cast wounding whispers but they might struggle to hit me now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Bard(17), Pale Master(13),

I've traded EMA, EW and some PM AC for this.\u00a0<br/>\nIt's stronger in a party as a result at the expense of these powerful defensive abilities.\u00a0<br/>\nSolo this build should do fine too.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
