      "content": "<div>KidMiracleman and Empyre65.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was looking at the Monk 35 Fighter 5 by Tattooed Monk, and although it's an OK build, have you considered a couple of changes would make it MUCH stronger? At first glance, all these Monk levels seem like a waste to me, except for the fact they make you move as fast as a cannonball. Let's agree that your ideal total of Monk levels is 16, and then we need 6 Fighter levels to get EWS for our fists, that leaves us a WHOPPING 18 FREE levels that we can add of any other class to make this guy more combat-effective. If the levels are taken in a class that adds Tumble as a class skill, then you don't even need to wait a long time to get all your Monk levels going. Why not take Assassin 18? That gives you Death Attack, extra d6 of damage, 2 Epic Bonus Feats, Improved Invisibility, Invisibility, Darkness, UMD at the cost of some mildly useful Monk bonus feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm talking about A Fighter 6 Monk 16 Assassin 18 build that can have a full attack schedule, extra SA damage, can surprise the enemies in Stealth or Invisibility and PARALYZE them in the first flurry, dealing an INSANE amount of damage through the combination of DA d6 dice and a d20 fist with a huge STR bonus.

If the monsters follow you, and leave their paralyzed comrade behind, you can lose them, go back and kill him and then paralyze another one. Anyway, hope you like it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

Problem is, you've never played one, so you don't know how DEADLY it is. I suggest you play one through Aielund (just make sure you don't use any Henchmen cuz the enemy can only be paralyzed if he or she is out of combat mode). Assassins do better solo or in parties with Humans that understand that the Assassin ALWAYS STRIKES FIRST.

You'll lose ONE BONUS FEAT from these two levels of Fighter to get 36 rounds ONCE A DAY of Concealment that you can get from scrolls (which are dispellable, but last 70 Rounds and can be rebuffed if necessary), and when you attack and become visible, I'm not so sure, but I think the Concealment bonus can't be dispelled anymore, can it?<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I'd stay with the Bonus Feat in this case. Have you considered what you'd drop in exchange for Empty Body in your suggested tweak?<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div></blockquote>\n\nEmpty Body is twice per day, duration = monk levels, so two 18 round uses of undispellable 50% concealment and are not dependent on scrolls.  That's pretty good in my book.  Of course mixing in 5 levels of fighter gives an extra attack, 6 points of damage and +1 AB, so maybe M18/F5/A17?  I have never played an Assassin so the merits of 17 levels are unknown to me.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Not really Theo.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the time you reach that 18th Monk level, you'll be faced with the following dilemma: If your combat lasts more than 18 rounds, which it will, then it'll probably last WAY MORE than that, as you'll be facing a very tough encounter, and your EB will expire midway through, which is BAD. If it's not, then it's probably not worth using, not to mention shortcutting. If you have 10 Improved Invisibility scrolls in a shortcut, you'll be able to rebuff numerous times, regardless of dispels, and if you have 10 stacks of 10 II scrolls, then you'll never run out. Now, again, why waste two levels to take a class that will give you something that you ALREADY HAVE? I'm not even saying it's not good, I'm saying, you already have INFINITE access to Improved Invisibility and a once-per-day VERY HARD TO DISPEL use from Assassin 9. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in that suggested spread of yours, you just dropped 2 feats. Fighters gain a bonus feat every 2 levels, so a drop from Fighter 6 to Fighter 5 costs you a feat (probably EWS) and Assassins get an epic feat every 4 levels after 10, so 14 and 18, so you lost another feat going from Assassin 18 to 17. <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, you GAVE UP 2 epic feats to get something you already have. How can you think it's good?<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"
