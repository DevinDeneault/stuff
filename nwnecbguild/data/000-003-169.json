      "content": "<div>Hi there, Nekro83, and WELCOME!<br/>\n<br/>\n It's bad luck that I happen to be your first reply, because I won't pretend to be anything like a master at building (I might carry a hod, but I'm no mason or architect).<br/>\n<br/>\n That said, I'm fairly sure those who could give constructive help will need to know a few more things. Which server are you using, because some of the stats you give seem very different from most - for example, with all the NwN stuff I've played and read about, extra points in any stat (in your case STR or CHA) are available every 4 levels (4, 8, 12, 16, 20, etc). Equally, Divine Wrath seems to work differently (standard is that for every 5 levels of CoT you take - after the first +3 5/1 at level 5 - attack and damage bonuses increase by a further 2).<br/>\n<br/>\n These are just examples. Other questions might include: what sort of Divine Spellcasting are you looking for? What's the overall nature of your intended build? Solo ass-kicker or party member/leader? What sort of enmvironment will you be playing in (high, med or low magic - what's available to be picked up)?<br/>\n<br/>\n Hope this doesn't sound negative, I'm just trying to lay the groundwork for the sort of quality build these guys produse.<br/>\n<br/>\n Again, good to have you aboard! <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/11.gif\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT:</strong></em> Except I'm not your first reply! The mighty Empyre got in there earlier. He'll ask more sensible questions!</div>",
