He's always been quite human AFAIK.\u00a0 The fact that he comes from the North Pole would probably indicate some Nordic or Germanic ancestry but since he is a myth I suppose anything goes.\u00a0 The elves are his workers and I doubt they would enjoy a dwarf as their employer, not under typical AD&amp;D mythology anyway. Gnomes are extremely clannish and mistrusting of those outside their race.\u00a0 I don't see them as a match at all for agregarious sort.<br/>\n<br/>\n Yeah, probably wizardly or even a druid, if you go divine.\u00a0 His history suggests some god-like legacy and magicians (or at least some sort of diviner) are as close to gods as one can get.\u00a0 He should use a staff I guess, a staff with one of those globes filled with snow mounted on top that he shakes when he yells \"Ho ho ho!\".\u00a0 Leaves his other hand free to sling the bag over his shoulder.\u00a0 He might need to re-light the fireplace after the concussion from his sudden visit settles down, so perhaps some fire-kindling spell like Burning Hands would be handy.<br/>\n<br/>\n I don't think St. Nich is a trickster, nor bard (which is just a thief who happens to sing show tunes).\u00a0 The occasional bag of coal is given as a warning of his own disappointment rather than a punishment.\u00a0 Generally, he is a kind-hearted soul so either NG or LG works for me.\u00a0 CG?\u00a0 Probably not.\u00a0 I don't see a chaotic Santa wearing a straight-jacket and being administered meds to get him back into social graces.\u00a0 I've often wondered what Santa did after Christmas... his elves make all the gifts.\u00a0 Who grooms the reindeer?\u00a0 Elves would need ladder to reach them.\u00a0 Just wondering... maybe spend some quality time with Mrs. Claus in Bermuda?\u00a0 But then there is that bikini issue.\u00a0\u00a0 Hmmm.... needs more ruminating, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\n I am not familiar with the series of modules you are referencing.\u00a0 Does it use CEP? Is this new content?<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks for posting a topic in the holiday spirit, Mr. Fist.\u00a0 It is the first (and possibly the last) of 2015.\u00a0 Happy Holidays to you and those dear to you! <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The Trickery domain and some Rogue levels would help him sneak into people homes to leave gifts.<br/>\n For his alignment, his morality axis would definately be Good. I'm not sure where to place him on the ethics axis. Lawful because he judges whether children have been naughty or nice? Chaotic because he breaks into people's homes?<br/>\n What about the other domain? Knowledge to help him divine children's niceness or naughtiness? Healing? Good? Or even Magic? Maybe another domain that I didn't think of?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

LC is the toughest shift to achieve without a manager of some sort judging from all the PWs and CC I've played, though not the BoK series.<br/>\n<br/>\n Not sure what the value of extra music achieves with 24 per day already in the queue. I'd discard that completely, post the Curse version and be done with it.\u00a0 Dump the Toughness so IKD appears within pre-epic.\u00a0 WIS 11/INT 13 opens up Expertise to sub in the Toughness slot if IKD is not desirable.<br/>\n<br/>\n Another shame is Dirge and Icestorms failing cast quite often in heavy equipment.\u00a0 A high-level Bard would usually go Autostill to enable the full range of spell repertoire without robes.<br/>\n<br/>\n Maybe shift the excess UMD and the token Lore allotment into Taunt to help vs. high Conc types (even with song boost, current Taunt level will fail most of the time and waste a combat round).\u00a0 I'd have no compunction subbing ESkF:Perform for more smiting.\u00a0 Screw the puny pre-epic skill boost. You've gotten other needs. Naturally, unless the module abounds in custom blueprints biased towards evil types (as your chosen venue may well contain), smite opportunities will be limited to undead, drow... the typical evil creature types.\u00a0 With the epic skill boost you may actually be able to raise enough to perform a level 24 song at 70.<br/>\n<br/>\n TM's Knight Who Says Nee was similar.\u00a0 Not DevCrit but more damage and AC with Divine boost feats.<br/>\n<br/>\n At any rate, Santa should steer clear of high-level mages who will shred any mantles erected with scrolls quickly and then Bigby and steal his bag of goodies... unless the module uses a lame AI that allows a PC to get within taunt range of them.
