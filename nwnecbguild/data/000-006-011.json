      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">I have visited the concept of a full-plate warrior that emerges from the shadows and delivers incredible punishment twice in the past, in the form of <em>The Dark Assailant</em> and <em>The Shadow Warrior</em>, both weapon masters in the trade. I always took measures to correct their inherent weaknesses, namely their faulty saving throws above all else. The solution that I found comes from abolishing the weapon master part and welcoming the true and trusty Champion of Torm, as it not only corrects that part but leaves enough bonus feats to have everything I've ever wanted and then some. Here comes Knight Artorias with 50 stealth in full-plate armour, delivering improved knockdown-devastating critical alpha-strikes with maximum strength and then melding into the shadows again, rinse and repeat.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/file/Dark-Souls/hd_artorias_fan_art.jpg\" /><br/>\n<br/>\nFighter(14),

It's all very annoying and not at all surprising! <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\nI don't have anything really to add...except that Artorias would obviously make a splendid dwarf (easy enough to lose LoH), except the loss of skill points could really hurt. Oh well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did make use of the 3 classes myself (F12/ CoT 14/ SD 14), but as a dual-wielding Epic Dodger, in my\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/lostara-yil-fighter-12-cot-14-sd-14-t2355790.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lostara Yil</a> build. She's an RP build, though, so not min-maxed. It's nice to see the potential flexibility of the 3 classes though.<br/>\n<br/>\nA great build, Valerfor - thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Been thinking a bit more about a dwarven version - and you don't need to lose those skill points. Keep CON at 12 and make both INT and DEX 14 - ta-da! So, you'd just lose 1 to all saves (except Reflex) - meh. Short beardies for the win!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

For dropping dev crit attacks against the flat-footed and unsuspecting, it is almost overkill (pun not intended).<br/>\nThis one should work well as a front line fighter too, even if it has less than 500 hp. You can bolster your defences with Shadow evade, or bail out with HIPS if it gets too rough.<br/>\nThe saves are very good and have a good synergy with several of the defensive feats from the SD class.<br/>\nEven with 14 fighter- and 10 CoT levels, you have to make priorities, and I can understand why you chose to drop EWS.<br/>\nI only have one minor suggestion, and that is to start taking listen one level earlier. You have 7 skill points to play with at lvl 26.<br/>\n<br/>\nStag has shown how you can build this one as a dwarf. Actually, you can do the same with Half-orc (!) starting with Str 18, dex 14, con 12, wis 8, Int 14, cha 6. But also there, you have to drop one of the less essential pre-epic feats to make it work.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
