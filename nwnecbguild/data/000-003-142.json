Much more a \"bring it to me\" character. Warhammer and shield, heavy armour, high STR and CON - a veritable immovable object and imposing presence, but a great tactician. Slow to rile, but once roused...Probably ought to be LG, but unfortunately that would knacker Barbarian. My best guess would be a few levels of Barbarian and Fighter, and loads of CoT, but it just doesn't seem quite right. Too...simplistic, perhaps, particularly given that she's supposed to have an indomitable will - and boosting Half-Orc INT may be a thankless task.<br/>\n<br/>\n Any thoughts? (Other than \"go away\")<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That seems pretty much what I was looking for. As with my previous request, this is DW build, so that gives me some scope re feats - and I can drop some DEX (don't need Ambi) for more CON, and given that she'll be \"full plate and packing steel\" rather than wearing wire wool, that shouldn't impact hugely on AC. Oh, assuming a 15 DEX isn't a HS requirement (never played that before either).<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway...Good stuff!

I suppose that means finally heading into a PW, but my friend (who's read everything wot I've wrote, and these two do spend a lot of time in each other's company) has just got Baldur's Enhanced, so I might give them separate run-throughs in Aielund first, just to see how they perform (I'm guessing this particular character will be mine)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I tend to be a bit obsessive with each campaign, trying to master it in several incarnations, before going on to the next. Thus, my first year was spent exclusively on the OC + Aribeth's Redemption and SoU + HotU, then this last six months has been Aielund-centric. That would seem to indicate that I'm about due a shift in focus. I have Sands of Fate loaded already, so it'll probably be that next. I've been recommended the Adam Miller campaign almost since joining here, but I can't remember the names of the mods for it and the Vault doesn't seem to recognise a search for 'Adam Miller', so perhaps you could remind me, please?<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

To avoid that, I alternate between different campaigns with different builds. Here is what I played in the last few years:<br/>\n<br/>\n DEX-based Elf Rogue 16 / Wizard 2 / AA 22 with longbow in SoU ... Sands of Fate<br/>\n STR-based Bard 11 / Fighter 14 / RDD 15 with scimitar in the OC + Aribeth's Redemption<br/>\n STR-based Bard 11 / Fighter 14 / RDD15 with longsword in The Eye of the Beholder<br/>\n DEX-based Rogue 19 / Monk 11 / Fighter 10 with kamas in SoU ... SoF<br/>\n STR-based Cleric 4 / Fighter 14 / WM 22 with katana in Aielund<br/>\n STR-based Fighter 18 / Bard 7 / RDD 15 with longsword in SoU ... SoF<br/>\n STR-based Monk 32 / Fighter 8 unarmed in Aielund<br/>\n DEX-based Rogue 19 / Monk 11 /  Fighter 10 with kamas in the OC + AR<br/>\n STR-based Rogue 7 Fighter 8 / WM 25 with longsword in SoU ... SoF<br/>\n STR-based Rogue 26 / Fighter 4 / CoT 10 with longsword in the Adam Miller Campaign<br/>\n STR-based Fighter 18 / Bard 12 / RDD 10 with katana in Aielund<br/>\n STR-based pure Cleric with morning star in Saleron's Gambit<br/>\n STR-based Monk 25 / Sorcerer 1 / RDD 14 unarmed in Aielund<br/>\n STR-based Rogue 26 / Fighter 4 / CoT 10 with longsword in Eye of the Beholder<br/>\n STR-based Fighter 24 / Bard 9 / WM 7 with scimitar in OC + AR<br/>\n and currently, <br/>\n STR-based Dwarf Fighter / Bard 6 / RDD 10 with longsword in SoU ... SoF<br/>\n<br/>\n There are some other builds I played before that, but I don't remember exactly what and in what order. Here is what I have planned for the future:<br/>\n<br/>\n DEX-based Elf Rogue 17 / Wizard 1 / AA 22 with longbow in Aielund<br/>\n STR-based Fighter 8 / Bard 4 / RDD 8 with longsword in Adam Miller campaign<br/>\n STR-based Rogue 26 / Fighter 4 / CoT 10 probably longsword in Saleron's Gambit<br/>\n STR-based Druid 28 / Fighter 4 / CoT 8 with scimitar in OC + AR<br/>\n DEX-based Monk 25 / Fighter 10 / Shadowdancer 5 in Aielund (I'll need to update my ancient Aielund for this)<br/>\n DEX-based Halfling Rogue 25 / Fighter 4 / CoT 11 with daggers in SoU ... SoF<br/>\n STR-based Monk 25 / Sorcerer 1 / RDD 14 with kamas in Eye of the Beholder<br/>\n STR-based Cleric 17 / Fighter 3 with longsword in Adam Miller campaign<br/>\n STR-based Rogue 26 / Fighter 4 / CoT 10 with katana in Aielund<br/>\n DEX-based Elf Rogue 17 / Wizard 1 / AA 22 in OC + AR<br/>\n STR-based Monk 25 Sorcerer 1 / RDD 14 with kamas in SoU ... SoF (repeat from long ago)<br/>\n STR-based Fighter 8 / Bard 4 / RDD 8 with scimitar in Saleron's Gambit<br/>\n STR-based Fighter 20 / Bard 10 / RDD 10 with shortwords in Aielund<br/>\n<br/>\n I would be happy to share any of these builds.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks for the Adam Miller link, Empyre, greatly appreciated. IIRC, it's a low-med magic campaign, which should test transferable builds more strongly than mid-high magic environs - and that has to be a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'll be putting your campaigns history into my 'favourites', so I'll always know where to find it and ask for details. I suspect our prefered styles synch, in that we seem to prefer a more mundane (as opposed to arcane) approach. That said, you have much more discipline (as well as ability) in your focus than I. I tend towards a butterfly approach - whatever build grabs my fancy at a time - sometimes several at once. Sad but true.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, first in line is your persuasive archer (see, I remember!). Please do let us know how that goes - I'm guessing in the Aielund thread.<br/>\n<br/>\n To get back on topic (and demonstrating the butterfly nature in action): I think maybe I was seduced by going Dwarf because I'm familiar with that type of build and race. So I've decided on Half Orc to test myself. I'm torn between a variation on Valerfor's Savage Strike (F12/Rog2/CoT26) and Max's aforementioned Daelan build.<br/>\n<br/>\n Great fun, Boo!
