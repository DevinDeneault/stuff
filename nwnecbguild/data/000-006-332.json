      "content": "<div>First, AmbiSEXterity?  That sounds like an epic feat... or maybe not.. not sure what that feat would allow.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOk, now that the bad, immature, typo joke is out of the way.. I'm not sure this build should have went directly to this forum.  This is usually reserved for pretty well finished builds.  You might have wanted to start in Build requests with this one.  The format is also a little off.  Typically, skills are listed separate from attributes/feats.  This makes it easier to follow your progression.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it seems your playing intention is a sneaking dev critter.  It feels like Shadowdancer is kinda forced into this melee heavy build of Fighter/WM.  I'm wondering if it might work better with rogue instead of WM?  You'd lose 1 BAB, but gain Sneak attack (a way to take advantage of your sneakiness), a ton of skill points so you can up your Hide/MS, and more convenient (and less awkward) skill dumps for those roguish, sneaky skills.  Forcing the issue by cross classing those skills with fighter seems less than ideal, especially for only two levels of SD.  Taking Rogue will also allow you to cut back on one level of SD as it would be redundant.  1 level of SD would give you HIPS and another skill dump.  I'm thinking a Fighter 28/Rogue 11/SD 1 kind of spread, Fighter 16/Rogue 4 pre-epic.  Finding a way to fit in KD and IKD would enable your character to get in more sneak attacks and take advantage of Crippling strike (which you should get at Rogue 10).  Spaced properly, you'd be able to max Hide/MS and get a full 40 ranks in tumble.  Also, drop WIS down to 8 and pump CON up to 12.  The one downside is that you would suffer a 20% xp penalty for a good majority of the build if you insisted on Half-Orc.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, in summary, I'd tweak your build a little to either take more advantage of the Dev Crit sneaker idea, or forget the sneaker angle.  Forcing it into a Fighter/WM split seems awkward.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Final max HPs?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only scenario I can possibly justify to take Epic Toughness is if you have a spare slot in epic and there is nothing else worthwhile so take a single ET feat.  Otherwise, ALWAYS take 2 Grt CON instead of 2 Epic Toughness (I notice you have four of them selected in epic) to gain both the HP and Fort save.  You can select Armor Skin, Epic Prowess &amp; other feats as ftr bonus to allow you do get the HP boost you are after.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust the first things that jumped out at me.  Please keep in mind that it is much easier to read a build if you keep the skill distribution separate from level-up sequence.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas this build been run through a trainer or play-tested at all?  For finished, published builds, this should be a prereq.  You will discover many inefficiencies that simply do not show up on a build chart.  Even better, pick a server so you can see how it performs depending on the magic environment you have selected.  It makes a HUGE difference!</div>"

      "content": "<div>I applaud the attempt.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if wm is the best idea for the build.  The investment in feats is high.  The thinning of the stats is gimpific (yes, my word) - i tend to be a min/maxer.  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do I mean?  In my day, i have played around with dev critters like this.  IN PRC land, I built an Tempest build (twf specialist) that was ALSO a cleric, and pumping BOTH wisdom and Strength (and having the 15 dex for the twf feats), I still ended with a higher strength than this guy.  AND, he was human, which tells me that, with this class split, you SHOULD have (with half orc) dev crit by lv 22 TOPS!  (yes, i play aggressively).  <br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you go for twf, you MUST, not need, MUST have a way to boost AC to protect yourself because you are lacking a shield.  Dexers use dex!  My Tempest used Cleric spells (i had lv 26 caster level for cleric    ).  How is this guy going to do that?  HIP is NOT AC!  Sure it hides him, but when in combat, being turned base, he needs to be protected.   This is an inherant problem with 2 wpn strengthers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn order to make up for it, you can use ALSO super high strength.  Strength pumps BOTH AB (which you use WM lvls for), AND Dev crit DC (Wm has no affect on this).  What this tells me is, you should be getting Gr strength 7!  WIth all the epic bonus feats (and ftr feats in epic), you have more than enough room to do that.  <br/>\n<br/>\n21:1SD  Gr st 1<br/>\n22:WM9<br/>\n23:WM10<br/>\n24:WM11~STR+1gr st 2<br/>\n25:WM12<br/>\n26:WM13~ overwhelm<br/>\n27:F13~  Gr str 3<br/>\n28:F14~STR+  DC<br/>\n29:F15~<br/>\n30:F16~~Great STR 4, EWF<br/>\n31:F17~<br/>\n32:F18~STR+1 ews<br/>\n33:F19~Great STR5<br/>\n34:F20~epic prowess<br/>\n35:F21~<br/>\n36:F22~STR+1Great STR6, armor skin<br/>\n37:WM14<br/>\n38:WM15<br/>\n39:WM16~Great STR7 / FREE FEAT<br/>\n40:SD2 str<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, str is 18 + 5 + 7 + 5 = 35 ! <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, your AB is higher.  Your Dev crit DCis higher (so they have a harder time rolling for safety).  With the Free feat, I may even want to go 19 wm to squeeze out more AB and still find an epic feat by dropping sd2 and ftr 21 22, and taking SD1 at lv 37 for dump.   <br/>\n<br/>\nBut still, by doing that, you have to wonder, \"how am i going to go against bossess?\"   You will find resorting to sword and board, and with pve areas at or slightly above your level, that will be the normal way you play (to increase AB and AC), which makes the whole idea of str twfing moot.  At least, in my years of playing, that is what I found to be the case.  TWFing is fun AS LONG as you have others there to rely on as you become a mediocre meleer.  <br/>\n<br/>\nJust my 2 cents<br/>\n<br/>\n*note, i did not show how I would go for lv 22 dev crit as I didnt want to change the build much.  I would have dropped wm for RDD and really pumped the strength (add +10 to strength base) for 45.  Now you are playing at MAX DC range and possibly max AB range.  With UMD and some AB clerical scrolls.. omg!  LOL</div>"

Since DW forces you to allocate significantly to DEX and INT can only be boosted a great expense point-wise, there is a big hole to dig out of. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, in my example, INT was left at the min for Expertise and could have been set to 14 as you did.  But a paltry 40 more skill points will not be enough to max both Hide and Move Silently, both necessary to make HiPS worthwhile.  Tumble could have been ignored but AC with maxed tumble is barely \"okay\" as it is with +8 Tumble AC.  I feel SD is a waste in this combo.  Reflex saves will be relatively low (@23) which pretty much wastes Evasion... and with heavy armor (assuming that would be your preference) the most your toon will lose without UD in effect is 1 AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, DWing scimis will cause a -4 DW penalty, one that will cause your AB to become very pedestrian (your +43 AB will become +39 on both hands... not good).<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep trying!  Use the combat debugging mode (like in a trainer) to see how your attacks are actually working out in practice.  That's about all I can suggest to make building more effective.</div>"
