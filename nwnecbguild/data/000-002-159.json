      "content": "<div>I'm with you all the way on this, Valerfor.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany PWs and most modules won't allow you the luxury of playing at level 40, and many players either don't have the inclination or facility to do so, and we would be remiss in our mission to assist in building to <em>all</em> levels unless we gave those level 20 and 30 builds some love.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd apart from helping players, it's surely a good discipline for the builder to squeeze what they can into the levels available. I've seen several putative builds lately that take pre-epic feats in epic levels - and that's a luxury only afforded by builds that will reach those glorified heights. How quickly we forget...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yes, an excellent idea. Builders get to hone their skills, players get to benefit - win /win!<br/>\n<br/>\n(And Mick started up something similar back in November 2017 about quality low-level - below 10 builds which we may sadly have let rot on the vine... <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/what-makes-a-strong-low-level-1-10-build-t2354767.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/what-makes-a-strong-low-level-1-10-build-t2354767.html</a>)<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, what can we do but do better?</div>",

Then I started playing WoG with its Epic Challenges etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuggest 20, 30 (Arelith) and 28 (for HoTU) -&gt; we can run a challenge perhaps.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe Level 28 can be a subsection forum to acknowledge that is essentially the Lvl cap for HoTU<br/>\n<br/>\n'Highest AB' playble warrior for HoTU challenge or something like that\u00a0</div>"

If we agree other areas need more attention, let's just attend to them, eh?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also averse to making something like a level 28 sub-forum, or the floodgates open and we have a level 36-38 Aielund build sub-forum, and so on. Just know it's a good general build or where the build will be played and construct accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

I think there were two ideas for the strongest lvl 1 build, a 18 Str fighter and a Druid level 1 with improved expertise<br/>\n<br/>\nOr the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/concept-yardstick-builds-t2293896.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">yardstick builds thread by TyrTemplar</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMight be a bit of fun you know<br/>\n<br/>\nAielund sub-forum... hmmm... good idea... but its pretty close to level 40... &gt;:)</div>"
