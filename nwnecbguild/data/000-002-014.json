Perhaps an EDR Half-Orc or Dwarf of some type?<br/>\n- Then you have the stealthy, slashing sociopath: Assassin definitely (maybe with some SD thrown in).<br/>\n- The diabolic is next up - maybe a Sorcerer/ BG/ RDD (don't even know if that's possible)? *<br/>\n- Mustn't forget the dear old undead, so PM can finally make an appearance (I've been trying to avoid it until now: a shame Cleric isn't a 'feed' into the class, really).<br/>\n- Werewolf pretty much has to be a Druid, and I want to say Barbarian.<br/>\n- Almost forgot the more playful sprite type - Rogue of some sort (maybe hin?).<br/>\n- There really should be a Cleric in the mix somewhere: after all, it is All Saints' Eve, so has (un)holiness all over it.<br/>\n- I could go on, but won't.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a few ideas to encourage folk!<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: * Oops - of course it's possible - <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/moghedien-melody-of-the-dark-bard-26-bg-4-rdd-10-t2350150.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Moghedian</a>. I am an idiot. I know that's a Bard rather than a Sorcerer, but it does make it better, I think.
