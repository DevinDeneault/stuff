But it's a good, playable build that I'd recommend to many an aspiring shootist. Oh, and you get a BOGOF here, as Empyre volunteers his Persuasive Archer later on in the thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd here's a wee snapshot. I believe Robert's saying, \"You swore blind that this was a fancy dress party!\"</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/a1fdkG3.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\nI blame Empyre and Mick entirely for this. They're both going through Aielund with AAs and I feel left out. Empyre's being rogueish and persuasive, and Mick's come over all holy, so I thought I'd have my first stab at an AA build. I'd initially contemplated a Fighter 12 / Wiz1 / AA 27, but then thought: who's my main man? So have ended up with a Monk 12 / Wiz 1 / AA 27 Elf. I'm relatively certain I haven't max-ed its potential (no Zen Archery, to start with, and utterly useless until L3), but I've tried to keep it simple.

As is ever the case with these things, what's one of the first enhanced bits of kit I pick up in my test run through Aielund - Tiger Gloves+1 (enhancement+1 and +1 slashing damage - Monk only). I'll keep them equipped until either some Dex gloves come along or an enhanced Kama. As yet, however, as you say, I've only used my bow (well, technically Dante's bow, I nicked it from him when I picked him up - he can have it back later, after the Ranger quest). Sneaks/AoOs are a bugger atm, so will need to keep my elven eyes peeled for something that defends against them. Am currently at L4 and have just gone under the church crypt. The toon's looking quite cool atm - a female Drow monk archer is less expected than the Spanish Inquisition!<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks for having a look.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I should have picked that up myself, but suspect I still had my Fighter goggles on and merely transposed Monk over the Fighter levels I'd had. Lazy: bad Stag. Nice for the Spellcraft boost, too. I'll also pick up what you say about Rapid Shot.<br/>\n<br/>\n I think I'll stick with 3 levels of Monk in epic - at 22, 32 and 40. I know 40 seems a strange time to take the final Tumble dump, but to take it earlier would be to push back Epic Prowess and the final Enchant Arrow bonus by one level each, and +2 AB (and +1 damage) trumps +1 AC at that stage. Taking Monk9 at level 22 forced me to think about when to take EWF:Longbow. I didn't really want to push it back to level 25, so have settled on bringing it forward to level 21 and dropping a GreatDex back to 25 (AA14).<br/>\n<br/>\n As far as Discipline is concerned, I confess that I'm torn. While I do understand what you say about going toe-to-toe - and I intend to avoid it where possible - my worry is that if I'm left with no choice I don't want to be spending too much time knocked flat, so it's a sort of comfort blanket. Also, what to replace it with? I could take more in Concentration for Taunt resistance, but that too only applies in a toe-to-toe situation. I could cross class some Search and Trap skills, I suppose, or even go for Persuade. Any advice welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I started from the position of taking a full 30 AA levels, and whittled them down one at a time to accommodate playability (that is, <strong>my</strong> playability, I'm sure others can comfortably do an AA29 or 30). I'm hoping to be a stealthy, speedy archer wearing robes at all times (I do appreciate that taking Rogue would give me access to UMD and thereby some Monk gear) - I only included the AC in plate etc for the sake of completeness, and it's wrong in any case because AA only gives access to light and medium armour.<br/>\n<br/>\n Following Mick's suggestion, I'm losing Monk12 now, so bang goes the unbreachable SR, which won't help your confused state any!<br/>\n<br/>\n My intention is to travel with companions - including a front-liner/tank, to hopefully draw attention and allow me some space and time to pick my targets. The Finesse, Discipline and Concentration are for those times when that doesn't work, and even then I'll be shieldless. Perhaps there is some perversity to this build - I just didn't want to replicate what others had done, albeit to great effect.<br/>\n<br/>\n I did say at the end of the OP that I recognised the stupity of the longsword option.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cin's Singing Sniper was certainly worth a look - and manages to avoid the xp penalty very cleverly - but old habits die hard, and I can't quite bring myself to go for a STR10 build. Sorry, muleish to the end!<br/>\n<br/>\n I think I'd like to see how this one pans out in practice, even if it does mean I'm making life unnecessarily difficult for myself!<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers for the input <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /></div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If some of the bad guys come after you, running and shooting can also serve as a means to divert some of the pressure that is on the meat shield. <br/>\n But monk is not only about speed. Monk serves well as tumble class and grants evasion and improved evasion. Monk also has better AC than other high-dexers, in part because of the extra AC you get every 5th level, but even more because of the extra AC you get when you add to wisdom from items or spells.<br/>\n Monk also has better saves than the alternative classes, with 3 primary saving throws and the still mind feat. Immunity to poison and disease is also a nice bonus.<br/>\n Lack of uncanny dodge is a problem with monks in general, but a run'n gun archer seems to do well without it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\n<br/>\n Get the boots of travelling from the clothes merchant in Bracksford asap.

That solves the entire mighty issue easily.\u00a0 But thanks for at least resolving the armor confusion.\u00a0 I've seen CHA AA builds that revolved around shooting in heavy plate but those were essentially PBS builds that did not use extensive artillery methods and sucked trying to avoid AoOs.\u00a0 Cin's barb AA can rage twice a day to make up for that bit of mighty loss, if necessary, but it never is.\u00a0 The barb speed, however, does lend itself to the sniper technique and is not negated by gear as a monk's speed would be.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Rogues have UD, SA and UMD. Monks have speed, better AC and better saves. Both have an arcane caster class that can use scrolls and other class items. Monk doesn't need UMD to equip those monk boots and robes and whatnot.<br/>\n Run'n gun involves a lot of running. Speed makes crowd control possible by keeping distance, shooting, keeping distance, shooting etc. Melee is not a good option, period. If you are forced to melee you will need discipline and finesse. You have KD and can use gloves or kamas with a sub par AB (no WF or EWF). But a monk archer is a ranged specialist and is built to to be able to keep the distance for crowd control.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I've had a thought on the Discipline issue - I'm sure you'll let me know if it's a stupid one. Rather than thinking which skills I could use instead of Disc, what if I dropped INT down to 12 and simply lost the 40 SPs? The 2 points could be added to WIS at creation, giving that stat a +1 and therefore +1 to AC and the Will save (as well as adding 1 to, iirc, Heal and Spot). Admittedly, I'd need 1 more point in Spellcraft, which would have to be cross-classed, but given that I'd have 3 to play with, I'd still have 1 spare (to raise Heal to a mighty 2). Worth it?<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, I might - at a pinch - be prepared to drop STR to 10 or 12, much as it goes against my better nature, which could either boost CON by 2 (for HPs and Fort) if 10, or WIS again if 12 or 10 (again for AC and Will - possibly even Zen Archery, but I don't know much about that feat, except it doesn't count for AA bonuses). Or even more DEX (which would involve dropping Epic Prowess for another GDex so as not to end on an odd number).<br/>\n<br/>\n Dagnabbit - you see what happens when choices present themselves?! <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT:</strong></em> Sorry, hadn't realised this took us to page 2.

I've just cleared the Barbar camp in Aielund Part 1 at level 7: poor old Dante has been through the bacon-slicer a fair few times, but hey, he's asking for it, while I, as a monkish archer atm, am happily trotting around knocking barbarians' noses off - I even got a few to chase me, thereby alleviating Dante's plight and giving Nell chance to put a plaster on his wounds.<br/>\n<br/>\n It's not how I've played before - and I've only been any kind of archer once: Hip's superb Wulgar - but I'm getting used to it now, and it's fun!<br/>\n<br/>\n Btw, Mick, ta for the spoiler - it takes a lot to put another item on hold, but it's working thus far (I've kept the other beasties for later application)...Hope this doesn't break the covenant of the spoiler.<br/>\n<br/>\n Any further Aielund-specific stuff, I'll stick on the relevant thread, but I thought I'd confirm the utility of a Monk-AA build - even though I've yet to take an AA level.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">All right, I've taken this build across Aielund, and had a thoroughly great time doing it. However, I'm reluctant to shift it to the Full Epic forum. I, albeit reluctantly, have to admit that Rogue would have been a better tertiary class for what I was hoping to do (if I hear an \"I told you so\" even whispered from Hip I shall be most vexed). I made very little use of my stealth skills, and, given they took up two maxed skills, that's an awful lot of wasted skill points.<br/>\n<br/>\n I did, however, get an insight into a different way of playing: Mick's aforementioned gun'n run. That worked really, really well, but it's a sod if you're both travelling with companions and give a shit about them - because they <em>will </em>die. Quite a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm pleased I gave it a go, and that I succeeded in my test-run. There's probably a better version out there somewhere, but it's the first time I've actually finished a campaign with a shootist, so do give her a try if you fancy trying something different. She's not a <em>bad</em> build, but she's a long way from optimized.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks to all for contributions <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
