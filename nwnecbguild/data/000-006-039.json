      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hallo everyone!<br/>\nThis is my first post in the level 40 section. I would like to share what I consider a very strong and versatile build, which can be seen as a modern (EE legal) version of the classic \"Puff the magic dragon\".\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is a competent divine and arcane caster who can morph into a dragon and hit people with Monk attack schedule. She can turn on damage shields and Epic Warding and let herself be hit with near 1000 HP, all while piercing enemy casters' EW with her claws. She can stack up to five Storm of Vengeance plus Stonehold, Grease, and empowered Evard's on top of enemies before the fight even starts using Time Stop. If Harm is not nerfed, she can use True Strike+Harm (or Heal) to insta-kill non-spell resistant bosses. And if everything else fails, she has access to the true and tested Time Stop/Empowered IGMS/Still IGMS/IGMS combo.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis witch can be tough to play, but she has so many aces up her sleeve to overcome any situation that might arise. I enjoyed playing her greatly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Features:</strong><br/>\n- Full Druid and Wizard spellbook.<br/>\n- Dragon Shape with Monk AC and Monk attack schedule (5 APR).<br/>\n- Epic Warding (can be cast in dragon shape, and lets creature weapon pierce +20 DR).<br/>\n- Extend, Empower, and Still Spell. The latter lets you wear any uber-powered armor you might find and still cast some arcane spells, but it's mostly used for spellbook management.<br/>\n- Craft Wand and Scribe Scrolls.<br/>\n- Druid summons.<br/>\n- Many skill points, can be tailored to the environment to a great extent.<br/>\n- Can set all deadly traps except gas by casting One with the Land.<br/>\n- Undispellable crit immune polymorph (Elemental Shape) is available if needed.<br/>\n- OK HP in human form.<br/>\n- Good saves in dragon form.<br/>\n- Evasion, Cleave, Poison immunity.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Weaknesses:</strong><br/>\n- Very, very subject to dispels. This is the weakness of many dragon builds, as you cannot just Greater Sanctuary and rebuff when shifted. This build in particular, with her low caster level, will get stripped to nothing by every Mord and be left with little even by Greater Dispelling. I would say this is the single most difficult part of playing her, but it can be overcome.<br/>\n- Strong spell resistant enemies can be tough before level 40. This is usually easier to deal with than dispels, with some creativity.<br/>\n- The DC on Druid spells is OK but not stellar, on Wizard spells it's basically unusable. I still felt like Spell Focus feats are not really needed. Know thy enemy's weak save!<br/>\n- Saves are meh in human form.<br/>\n- No Discipline until 40.<br/>\n- Gear is hard to manage, with the shifting and everything. In particular you cannot use items granting Wizard bonus spell slots.<br/>\n- Late blooming, with Dragon shape at 33, level 9 Wizard spells at 35, EW at 39, and the final big power spike at 40. On the other hand, it never stops growing and almost every level brings something new until late epics!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Credits:</strong><br/>\nThanks to Mick Dagger and Ten Pura for their comments on an early version, and to Orion, Aquarius, and WebShaman for helping me refine the build and giving invaluable play tips for WoG. I understand WebShaman has in fact played the exact same level split 1-40 on WoG, so this build is not quite original. It is not written anywhere I believe, so I posted it. Those interested in the evolution of the build, and in some playtesting report, can find the original post <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-mountain-mystic-druid-18-wizard-21-monk-1-t2355519.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>\u00a0(different build name).<br/>\n<br/>\nI did not find any build with Druid 17 and Wizard 17 in the epic character search engine or on this forum, and the only builds there that get Dragon Shape and EW are illegal nowadays (DS needs Druid 18 instead of 14). <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">I feel like the most similar build to this one in spirit is actually Maximilian Kane's <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-magical-master-cleric-15-wizard-23-monk-2-t515401.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Magical Master</a>, which uses maxed out Cleric buffs instead of Dragon Shape\u00a0</span>\u00a0EDIT: Maximilian Kane disagrees, so I am likely wrong.

Changes to consider depending on the environment and playstyle are:<br/>\n** Craft Wand should probably not be taken without very good access to gold and XP.<br/>\n* These feats are not vital for the build and can be tailored. In my playthrough I actually had SF:Conjuration, GSF and ESF instead of Still Spell, Spell Penetration, and Epic Prowess. I missed Still Spell and did not feel the need for spell focus feats. Armor Proficiency:Heavy is also a consideration if you know you will find good \"spellsword\" heavy armor (you have 8 STR though).<br/>\nYou have a lot of skill points, you can do what you want. I had Animal Empathy and did not like it much, and I felt Search is very important on WoG.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are brave, you could start with 8 CON and 17 INT to gain a feat at the cost of 80 HP in human form. And if you really want to play for level 40 power: do not cross-class Tumble, dump Search and Spot, and max out Hide and Move Silently at 40. With dragon form DEX score and Camouflage, you have the potential to be an excellent sneaker! I went for more playability early on, but then again I did not know the environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here it is, I welcome questions, feedback, and any comments.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hail, TheSquid!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first post you make and you come with a REALLY TOUGH build to play! Kudos for playing it, especially on WoG. Dispels there are pretty much around every corner, so if you were able to play it there, it's probably a good build.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd like to say that my Magical Master isn't really similar to your build. I'd point you towards GDL's Dracolich of Autumn Twilight as a more similar build (goes for a Crit-immune dragon and gets Epic Warding), but doesn't have Monk attack progression.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso Order of Jormungandr is actually by Kail Pendragon, who made the original one when only 14 Druid levels were required for Dragon Shape. Then he reinterpreted it much later with the new changes as Druid 18 / Cleric 20 / Monk 2.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe obvious problem I see with this build is something that you can't do anything about, which is a dispellable polymorpher. These two things don't stack up well with each other. It may be playable on WoG, but I think it's not able to solo for the most part. The only thing I'd change in this build is the class split. If you go for Wizard 20 / Monk 2, you become a little more dispellable, but you gain Deflect Arrows and a MUCH NEEDED skill dump at level 22. IMO totally worth the tradeoff.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Again, I'm speaking from experience with my Champion of the Wilderness. He had 16 pr-epic BAB, which is 2 points higher than this build, and he couldn't reliably hit most high level bosses on WoG (AoO, Lolth and WDK). He could tank them, though. I was never able to solo the WDK with him either, which I believe this build could do with spells.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'd point you towards GDL's Dracolich of Autumn Twilight as a more similar build (goes for a Crit-immune dragon and gets Epic Warding), but doesn't have Monk attack progression.\u00a0</div></blockquote>\n<em class=\"mention\">@Maximillian_Kane</em>\u00a0:\u00a0Point taken, original post edited, but let me clarify my thinking. I think of my build as a Wizard with added perks, versatility, and the melee presence of a Dragon. I understood your Magical Master as Wizard with added perks, versatility from Cleric spells, and the melee presence of a good DEXer with Cleric buffs. Both are not good at penetrating SR nor are DC arcane casters, and both are subject to dispels. Still, I trust you on this as obviously you understand your own builds (and likely the game) way better than me.<br/>\nThe Dracolich of Autumn Twilight which I found\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build251344.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>\u00a0is a Druid26/Bard4/PM10 and does not have Epic Warding; did you mean a different build?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Yunim said, the reason for getting level 21 Wizard is to get EW. A level of Monk earlier would definitely make your life easier, but I would not say it is needed. And as WebShaman said, the reason you want EW is mostly to pierce enemy EW (sure it is fun to stand still with EW, damage shields, and 1000 HP though). As Maximilian Kane pointed out, this is not so interesting for the main bosses as both EW are likely to expire before anyone is close to dying if you fight fair, but not so for mobs. In particular, I don't know what this build would do without EW against a couple drow wizards and three warriors for instance. If the wizards decided to open up with EW and I were shifted,\u00a0 I would consider myself in an embarrassing situation. With EW though, a wizard dies in less than one round and there is no problem (except of course you cannot really do this every encounter). I did not dare test this before level 40, maybe it's not so bad.<br/>\nAnother reason why you might like to have EW is that you are susceptible to KD by some bosses (it takes a 20 to hit you but they might beat your discipline); and since most of your AC is DEX and Dodge, once you are down you are likely to stay down. If you have damage shields and EW up, you might have a chance (even with only EW, you can pray for the 1). If you rely on Dragon DR, not so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nI played this build exclusively solo. I did beat WDK, and indeed with spells. I was level 37 or 38 though, I think at 40 you can do it by hitting him (after baiting out his dispels), as WebShaman says. When I have access to online NWN again I will try.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>IIRC the fully buffed AB of this build is 53, correct?</div></blockquote>\nOn WoG, you can get a \"free\" +10 AB by using Tenser's Transformation, which conveniently can even be found in bottled form. Then I believe you have an AB in the 60s, which lets you hit 80 AC with some consistency.\u00a0 In vanilla NWN, this is not the case though.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'd point you towards GDL's Dracolich of Autumn Twilight as a more similar build (goes for a Crit-immune dragon and gets Epic Warding), but doesn't have Monk attack progression.\u00a0</div></blockquote>\n<em class=\"mention\">@Maximillian_Kane</em>\u00a0:\u00a0Point taken, original post edited, but let me clarify my thinking. I think of my build as a Wizard with added perks, versatility, and the melee presence of a Dragon. I understood your Magical Master as Wizard with added perks, versatility from Cleric spells, and the melee presence of a good DEXer with Cleric buffs. Both are not good at penetrating SR nor are DC arcane casters, and both are subject to dispels. Still, I trust you on this as obviously you understand your own builds (and likely the game) way better than me.<br/>\nThe Dracolich of Autumn Twilight which I found\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build251344.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>\u00a0is a Druid26/Bard4/PM10 and does not have Epic Warding; did you mean a different build?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Yunim said, the reason for getting level 21 Wizard is to get EW. A level of Monk earlier would definitely make your life easier, but I would not say it is needed. And as WebShaman said, the reason you want EW is mostly to pierce enemy EW (sure it is fun to stand still with EW, damage shields, and 1000 HP though). As Maximilian Kane pointed out, this is not so interesting for the main bosses as both EW are likely to expire before anyone is close to dying if you fight fair, but not so for mobs. In particular, I don't know what this build would do without EW against a couple drow wizards and three warriors for instance. If the wizards decided to open up with EW and I were shifted,\u00a0 I would consider myself in an embarrassing situation. With EW though, a wizard dies in less than one round and there is no problem (except of course you cannot really do this every encounter). I did not dare test this before level 40, maybe it's not so bad.<br/>\nAnother reason why you might like to have EW is that you are susceptible to KD by some bosses (it takes a 20 to hit you but they might beat your discipline); and since most of your AC is DEX and Dodge, once you are down you are likely to stay down. If you have damage shields and EW up, you might have a chance (even with only EW, you can pray for the 1). If you rely on Dragon DR, not so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nI played this build exclusively solo. I did beat WDK, and indeed with spells. I was level 37 or 38 though, I think at 40 you can do it by hitting him (after baiting out his dispels), as WebShaman says. When I have access to online NWN again I will try.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>IIRC the fully buffed AB of this build is 53, correct?</div></blockquote>\nOn WoG, you can get a \"free\" +10 AB by using Tenser's Transformation, which conveniently can even be found in bottled form. Then I believe you have an AB in the 60s, which lets you hit 80 AC with some consistency.\u00a0 In vanilla NWN, this is not the case though.</div></blockquote>\nNah, it was my mistake. I rebuilt that toon in 2 versions. One the same way as GDL, the other one as Druid 18 / Bard 3 / PM 19, which then I got Epic Warding with, so I mixed things up a bit. My apologies.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand why you say your build is similar to the Magical Master, and I agree with everything you said about their similarities. You are right on all accounts, and you didn't need to edit the post, I don't mind you mentioning it at all. However, let me explain why I think the Magical Master is different. He has access to \"all his tools at all times\", whereas this build, because it polymorphs, loses access to casting, and if not polymorphed, can't hold its own in melee, so it can't do both things simultaneously. The Magical Master CAN do both at the same time, and that difference alone makes it way more playable and powerful. The COMBOS you can do with the Magical Master.... Makes me almost not want to mention them, with fear that some mod will read this post and make them illegal. LOL. All I can say is that Lolth dies before she has a chance to move.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, is there a way to buy those Tenser's potions? If they're for sale, I forgot where. I know one can get a couple during a certain adventure or two (Dragon Cult and Duergar IIRC), but I\u00a0 dislike the idea of farming them. I don't think I've ever seen them for sale. If you know where, would you mind telling me about it? The Champion of the Wilderness could use about 50 of them LMAO! 11 rounds of godliness!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

And of course, everything else being equal, the build would be stronger if you could cast in dragon shape. What does not follow is that a different build, where everything else is not equal, is way more powerful for this particular reason. This is a weakness of this build, which you play around like all weaknesses.

I would like to share what I consider a very strong and versatile build, which can be seen as a modern (EE legal) version of the classic \"Puff the magic dragon\".\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nShe is a competent divine and arcane caster who can morph into a dragon and hit people with Monk attack schedule. She can turn on damage shields and Epic Warding and let herself be hit with near 1000 HP, all while piercing enemy casters' EW with her claws. She can stack up to five Storm of Vengeance plus Stonehold, Grease, and empowered Evard's on top of enemies before the fight even starts using Time Stop. If Harm is not nerfed, she can use True Strike+Harm (or Heal) to insta-kill non-spell resistant bosses. And if everything else fails, she has access to the true and tested Time Stop/Empowered IGMS/Still IGMS/IGMS combo.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis witch can be tough to play, but she has so many aces up her sleeve to overcome any situation that might arise. I enjoyed playing her greatly.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Features:</strong><br/>\n- Full Druid and Wizard spellbook.<br/>\n- Dragon Shape with Monk AC and Monk attack schedule (5 APR).<br/>\n- Epic Warding (can be cast in dragon shape, and lets creature weapon pierce +20 DR).<br/>\n- Extend, Empower, and Still Spell. The latter lets you wear any uber-powered armor you might find and still cast some arcane spells, but it's mostly used for spellbook management.<br/>\n- Craft Wand and Scribe Scrolls.<br/>\n- Druid summons.<br/>\n- Many skill points, can be tailored to the environment to a great extent.<br/>\n- Can set all deadly traps except gas by casting One with the Land.<br/>\n- Undispellable crit immune polymorph (Elemental Shape) is available if needed.<br/>\n- OK HP in human form.<br/>\n- Good saves in dragon form.<br/>\n- Evasion, Cleave, Poison immunity.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Weaknesses:</strong><br/>\n- Very, very subject to dispels. This is the weakness of many dragon builds, as you cannot just Greater Sanctuary and rebuff when shifted. This build in particular, with her low caster level, will get stripped to nothing by every Mord and be left with little even by Greater Dispelling. I would say this is the single most difficult part of playing her, but it can be overcome.<br/>\n- Strong spell resistant enemies can be tough before level 40. This is usually easier to deal with than dispels, with some creativity.<br/>\n- The DC on Druid spells is OK but not stellar, on Wizard spells it's basically unusable. I still felt like Spell Focus feats are not really needed. Know thy enemy's weak save!<br/>\n- Saves are meh in human form.<br/>\n- No Discipline until 40.<br/>\n- Gear is hard to manage, with the shifting and everything. In particular you cannot use items granting Wizard bonus spell slots.<br/>\n- Late blooming, with Dragon shape at 33, level 9 Wizard spells at 35, EW at 39, and the final big power spike at 40. On the other hand, it never stops growing and almost every level brings something new until late epics!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Credits:</strong><br/>\nThanks to Mick Dagger and Ten Pura for their comments on an early version, and to Orion, Aquarius, and WebShaman for helping me refine the build and giving invaluable play tips for WoG. I understand WebShaman has in fact played the exact same level split 1-40 on WoG, so this build is not quite original. It is not written anywhere I believe, so I posted it. Those interested in the evolution of the build, and in some playtesting report, can find the original post <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-mountain-mystic-druid-18-wizard-21-monk-1-t2355519.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>\u00a0(different build name).<br/>\n<br/>\nI did not find any build with Druid 17 and Wizard 17 in the epic character search engine or on this forum, and the only builds there that get Dragon Shape and EW are illegal nowadays (DS needs Druid 18 instead of 14). <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">I feel like the most similar build to this one in spirit is actually Maximilian Kane's <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-magical-master-cleric-15-wizard-23-monk-2-t515401.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Magical Master</a>, which uses maxed out Cleric buffs instead of Dragon Shape\u00a0</span>\u00a0EDIT: Maximilian Kane disagrees, so I am likely wrong.

In my playthrough I actually had SF:Conjuration, GSF and ESF instead of Still Spell, Spell Penetration, and Epic Prowess. I missed Still Spell and did not feel the need for spell focus feats. Armor Proficiency:Heavy is also a consideration if you know you will find good \"spellsword\" heavy armor (you have 8 STR though).<br/>\nYou have a lot of skill points, you can do what you want. I had Animal Empathy and did not like it much, and I felt Search is very important on WoG.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are brave, you could start with 8 CON and 17 INT to gain a feat at the cost of 80 HP in human form. And if you really want to play for level 40 power: do not cross-class Tumble, dump Search and Spot, and max out Hide and Move Silently at 40. With dragon form DEX score and Camouflage, you have the potential to be an excellent sneaker! I went for more playability early on, but then again I did not know the environment.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here it is, I welcome questions, feedback, and any comments.
