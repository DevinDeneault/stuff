      "content": "<div>The best mage killer is another mage but this build is a close contender. This is built specifically for fighting mages, since it is a very late bloomer I wouldn't recommend using it for PvP before 40. I also wouldn't recommend playing this on servers where +12 CHA is not achievable since the main source of damage is Divine Might. It is more suited to high or medium magic worlds than low magic ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing Divine Might with a ranged weapon allows it to ignore DI/DR and it can completely ignore damage shields. 61 SR gives immunity to most spells, and it has high saves and immunities for any spells that aren't resisted. Empty Body gives 7 minutes of undispellable 50% concealment which combined with speed forms your main defence. At level 40 this build can use epic traps and any scrolls or wands thanks to Set Trap and UMD.<br/>\nThe main disadvantages of this build are low AB, low damage, and low HP. Against high AC mages or mages with healing capabilities this build will be a distraction rather than a danger. It has fairly mediocre AC, which can be mitigated by buffing WIS (on top of buffing DEX, CON, and CHA) and swapping Called Shot for Divine Shield. There is also a multiclass penalty for most of the build which can be avoided by changing from halfling to human.<br/>\n<br/>\nHalfling was chosen as the race since it has the highest AB and is immune to Evard's Black Tentacles, although Monk 20 makes you practically immune to EBT anyway. Elf gives Keen Senses at the cost of lower AB, you will need to rearrange your skills in order to get Listen or Spot. Human lets you ignore the multiclass penalty but it will have lower AB than a halfling.<br/>\nCalled Shot can be effective against builds that neglect Discipline but due to your low AB it might be worth choosing a different feat. It can be swapped for Divine Shield, Extra Turning, IC: Sling, or Toughness, depending on what you want from the build.<br/>\nSling was chosen for the weapon since halflings get a +1 AB bonus when using it and this build needs all the AB it can get. Any throwing weapon will work too, but slings are much easier to use than throwing weapons. If you change race from halfling to elf or human then I suggest switching from slings to longbows for better damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n61 SR gives immunity to anything with a modified SPen level of 40. This means that level 40 mages without any Spell Penetration feats or level 34 mages with Epic Spell Penetration can't beat your SR. A pure level 40 mage with Epic Spell Penetration has a 30% chance of landing a spell, although not many PvP mages bother with SPen feats. If 61 SR isn't enough then you can swap EWF: Sling and Epic Prowess for two Improved Spell Resistance feats to reach 65 SR at the cost of 3 AB. Alternatively you can make a Monk37/Cler1/Figh2 which has 67 SR at the cost of 2 AB, 1 APR, epic traps, and UMD. There are some spells and monster abilities that ignore SR but most of them can be ignored due to race and class immunities.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nClass: Monk 35 / Paladin 4 / Rogue

The main problem with rakshasas is that they're shifters, which have plenty of problems when it comes to adaptability. Another problem is that default rakshaha Ice Storm is level 4 which means that Globe Of Invulnerability completely negates it. A Monk21/Dru9/Shif10 would work though, although depending on the server 9d6 Cold damage might not be enough to take down a mage.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Focusing on single-wielding kamas rather than a sling only loses 1AB as a halfling, but the main reason for using a ranged weapon is to avoid damage shields. Damage shields are a huge threat for most melee builds unless breach scrolls/wands are available. I've tested Druid/RDDs and RDDs with EER: Acid but usually they're just not good enough to fight a decent mage build, at least on low and medium magic worlds where damage shields are not nerfed.<br/>\nAs for IKD, most PvP mages will have decent Discipline scores. A standard Sorc38/Monk1/Pal1 can easily achieve over 50 Discipline, and since most PvP servers have Discipline boosting gear a low AB monk will struggle to keep a decent mage down. Your suggestions might work for PvM servers where epic caster mobs can be a serious threat, usually they tend to be fairly squishy so IKD spamming could work.</div>"
