the \"Full Epic 40\" section. <br/>\n<br/>\nRecap:<br/>\nAfter having played Orion\u2019s Boccob tricky devastator (nice build, btw), roleplayed as an evil follower of Erythnul, I thought to make a \u201cgood-aligned\u201d version.<br/>\nHowever, one of the features of the Tricky Devastator is the presence of...devastating critical!<br/>\nInitially a build with devastating critical has been made: it uses monk instead of rogue, to take advantage of the free cleave feat. <br/>\nTo increase challenge, I preferred to remove dev. crit., and so monk has been less useful: swift with rogue class, and extreme focus on Taunting ability, so to furtherly increase AB (think about adding a bard to the party....that would raise taunt to godly points!).<br/>\n<br/>\nMain features:\n<ul>\n<li>wields a rapier (anyone can choose a different weapon) and she crits more than longsword-wielding creatures;</li>\n<li>Extend spell feat doubles the castings of divine favor/aura of glory so CHA can be kept MAXed (reducing the need for specfic items), and craft wand to be able to make many wands (bless, bless weapon, holy sword, GMW, buls, eagle\u2019s splendor, etc\u2026);</li>\n<li>Extreme focus on taunt skill, which can reach more than 60 points with capped CHA;</li>\n<li>Mundane AB is 44;</li>\n<li>Divine might/shield for additional aces up on her sleeve;</li>\n<li>The only (??) build that takes \"Epic Reputation\" feat. </li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\nPaladin(32), Fighter(6), Rogue(2), Human<br/>\nFully tested up to lv 40 on World of Greyhawk

favor = 43 (86 when critting).<br/>\nDevastating critical DC (with capped STR): 46<br/>\n<br/>\nAC:\u00a0 base 30 + 20 (5 armor, 5 deflection, 5 dodge, 5 natural armor) = 50 + 5 shield + 8 divine shield + 5 expertise = 68 <br/>\n(one may want to take improved expertise feat to furtherly enchance AC)<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Notes about the build:</span><br/>\nEarly on, as happens for each paladin, no spell slots are available: the main scope of these very low levels is to get through hordes of enemies by heavily using the \"Taunt + expertise\" combo (which is very effective).<br/>\nThis helps reducing enemy's AC and reducing the AB penalty from expertise; later, she can rely also on \"Divine Favor\" to temporarily offset the AB penalty.<br/>\n<br/>\nCraft wand has been chosen due to WoG server customization (e.g. 50 charges per wand), so it can be replaced by many other feats.<br/>\nStarting from level 12 and (subsequently) 15 she can use Divine Might/Shield so to increase the damage dealt or AC, and that can increase the likelihood of survivability (especially on one-to-one battles against bosses): thanks to \"Eagle's splendor\" and \"Aura of Glory\" spells she can almost cap CHA, hence she relies less on CHA-enchancing equipment than non-paladin CHA builds.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main gains from the taunting ability are obtained late, as ESF:Taunt is obtained at level 36 and \"Epic Reputation\" at level 40: when level 40 has bene reached, taunt points are now 59 (65 with capped CHA) and she alone can taunt effectively also bosses.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Alternative suggested by Stagmeister:</span> to swap rogue levels for Harper Scout.<br/>\nTwo feats have to be replaced by \"Iron \"Will\" and Alterness\" (Craft Wand and...?); however, this allows for an additional feat (like ESF:discpline) that can furtherly boost her skillset.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Comparison with other builds (old and new guild), that have more than 30 Paladin levels.</span><br/>\n<br/>\nHoly Avenger: paladin 40 (human) by: GhostNWN<br/>\n<br/>\nPure paladin build, has many useful feats (e.g. divine shield/might), and has 43 AB.\u00a0 Would have benefitted more from a maxed Taunt (add ESF: Taunt?) and concentration Skills rather than Heal (so she can safely cast Divine Favor when near to the enemies). Weak point is lack of multiclassing, but one cannot have it all.<br/>\n(similar comment for the paladin yardstick builds in the new ecb guild).<br/>\n<br/>\nAn Unruly Knight: paladin 38 / rogue 1 / sorcerer 1 (human) by: Ithacan<br/>\nHidden Smiter, Crouching Avenger: monk 6 / shadowdancer 2 / paladin 32 (human?) by: Ithacan<br/>\nPaladin 33 / WM 7: paladin 33 / weapon master 7 (human) by: o0ophrostbyteo0o<br/>\nFocused on smiting, so more CHA rather than STR. Different concept.<br/>\n<br/>\nExhaulted Harper: paladin 35 / fighter 4 / Harper scout 1 (human) by: m_beaubien<br/>\nSTR build, has improved expertise and devastating critical. -1 AB and -2 STR, but +2 CHA. No defined skills (but taunt is one of the preferred ones).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
