Are you sure you have ALL the prerequisites? I see that you have the required feats and 25+ DEX by then, but do you have 30 Tumble?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your opponent has Blind Fight, he gets to make two concealment rolls and only if both rolls fail does the concealment block his attack, which effectively squares the concealment, so 50% becomes 25%, 40% becomes 16%, 30% becomes 9%, 20% becomes 4% and 10% becomes 1%. Because of this, builders usually go for all five Self Concealment feats, or they don't bother.<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Concealment\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Concealment</a><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

As you rightly say 50 becomes 25 (2x lower), 40 becomes 16 (2.5 times lower), 30 becomes 9 (3.3 times lower) 20 becomes 4 (5x lower) and 10 becomes 1 (10x lower). I confess, I don't know the answer, but that appears to be the logic - as far as logic can be said to apply, of course!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\n(Some Valerfor ninja-work going on, but I hope this is still useful)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd maybe, in Valerfor's Pit Fiend example, maybe the 70 become 52 or 53 (roughly 1.5x lower). A hypothetical, I realise, but that might follow the \"logic\"...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
