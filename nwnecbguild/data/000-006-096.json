      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I'm heavily biased to playing on a PW, also I know nothing about druids. That being said, here are some thoughts from the PW point of view:<br/>\n- Expertise is not needed for playing on PW, since if you can't stand the heat, you find a cooler kitchen. Just go elsewhere and grind for a while. Exception is on high level, but then you're a dragon.<br/>\n- Is there a practical use for the Animal Empathy skill? I've never seen it used on a PW.<br/>\n- Domains: If your PW has perma-haste or Speed potions available, you could choose Trickery for ImpInvis and Magic for more/better spells. (War with Battle Mastery is only once per rest and therefore not very useful on a PW.)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want this toon to be your one-stop-shop and never ever change to another toon, you might drop two wisdom feats and get Craft Wand and Scribe Scroll. Then you'd be totally self-sufficient and could live your life on the PW of your choice forever. Still, not sure it's worth it. It might be better to just make two more toons.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You don't get it otherwise &amp; I don't trust lowly potions in high-level play with their pathetic 3CL.<br/>\n<br/>\nb) Animal empathy is good, you can dominate dire bears/tigers with it, even an Androsphinx if you find him, or a basilisk, cockatrice or gorgon. The last three, all have petrification attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\na) Expertise is good, no doubt about it.

Is it an idea to allocate 4 buy points to intelligence for 43 extra skill points? There is room for several more ranks in the stealth skills and one more rank in animal empathy.<br/>\nYou have put 1 rank in set trap and open lock. Sadly enough you will not be able to use them in Dragon shape where you would get a huge bonus from the high dexterity and I question if they are worth it at all. The bonus from Divine trickery comes late and maxes out at +10.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for domains I say Trickery every time here for Improved invisibility. Second on the list is Travel unless there are perma haste items available, items that merge that is.\u00a0<br/>\nWar is nice for Cat's grace. You already have Aura of vitality from Druid and Battle mastery lasts too short to count here.\u00a0<br/>\nAnimal is another way to obtain Cat's. You also get better summons, an early true seeing and the polymorph spell, so you can disguise yourself as a tiny pixie. I would rather pick Animal than war, if nothing else for the RP value of the pixie polymorph.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I understand what you say about Expertise and the potential for IKD, but would Weapon Focus: Unarmed translate to dragon claws and be viable instead (again with a jigging about of pre-epics)? If so, that's potentially an AB bump, but which could also lead to swapping out Epic Prowess for Armor Skin at 39 for the same AB as now but +2 AC. If it doesn't translate, then please ignore the above as verbal diarrhoea. Unless WF in sling (or a crossbow if taken after getting Cleric) would help at early levels with Zen Archery?<br/>\n<br/>\nJust thought I'd ask.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I, too, think that's a great pic - better, even, than the potential Daeneyrs/Drogon mash-up.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I was trying to straighten out the need for IKD or not, so I read here:<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Knockdown\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Knockdown</a><br/>\nBut, I only got more confused. It's obviously wrong, since it states that \"A character can only make a <em>knockdown</em> attempt on opponents that are one size category larger than himself, or smaller\", which is obviously wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, ignoring that.... The way I interpret the KD/IKD feat is that if you have IKD you count as a bigger attacker against your opponent. The question then becomes, but what if you're already a Huge Dragon? Being Huge gives you +8 on the roll. Being Huge with IKD gives you one size larger, but you're already huge. Does that mean that you actually don't have any use for IKD? Unless you're knocking down another dragon in which case you get +8 instead of +4?<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, I'm so confused, but my point is: Do you need IKD if you're huge? I couldn't figure out if you did. In a feat-starved build it felt important to figure it out.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Damn, but it's hard to get to level 20.</div></blockquote>\nHi Cornflower<br/>\n<br/>\nCongrats on making it this far! I'm super impressed. I as well, hit a bump around level 18ish even with the Monk level\u00a0which hung around until I got to Dragon Shape (after which it gets cruisy).\u00a0I don't know if this is your first time playing the druid class either? Apologies if I'm covering ground you already know well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a limit on usages of dire bear shape and water elemental shape as well, which I presume are the shapes you are using. Around this stage I learned that running around super buffed as a bear or elemental was not going to be enough and I had to use other tools.<br/>\n<br/>\nApart from monk + shapes (which can be buffed with stoneskin/greater stoneskin/premonition, barkskin, Bull's strength, Owl's insight, extended blood frenzy, extended aura of vitality, freedom, death ward and true sight) your other tools are your animal companion and your spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding the animal companion, its offensive capabilities are excellent + can be buffed with greater magic fang too. Its defensive capabilities poor, as its AB will scale up much faster than its AC, and the bear companion (the one I used for maximal AB and HP) isn't knockdown or stun immune. Animal companion will also fall off as you take more levels of cleric (but you will grow stronger with the cleric buffs). It is always handy to buff the bear with stoneskin, freedom, barkskin and use heal to keep it alive as long as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding spells and fighting in Druid form. 22 Wisdom is good + when buffed with Owl's Insight + one wis item to cap it, it should lead to decent spell DCs (+12 modifier with Wis 34) even without spell foci.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso OoJ has zen archery so peppering them with a sling or shuriken (if you have strong ones) can be ok to save spells although 1d3 damage means things will tend to die slowly to your ranged weapons albeit you will hit them accurately.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy philosophy when playing Druid is to never fight fair. Always fight in a grease pit or stonehold cloud if they are susceptible where possible, add in summons or animal companion then shift to fight. Its like you are creating a toxic environment which doesn't affect you, but affects your enemies!<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are my favourite spell combos:<br/>\n<br/>\nAgainst mobs of fighters, clerics and mages (weak reflex saves) - Grease/Entangle/Stonehold/Storm of Vengeance + Summon Creature XIII or IX or Elemental Swarm and spam a whole bunch of call lightnings and/or fire storms then either shoot them with zen archery or polymorph and hit them in melee. Make sure you cast Freedom on yourself and your animal companion (if you use it). Elementals of that level are immune to stun and appear knockdown immune where I play (WoG) but my bear could easily be knocked down. If one has invisibility and speed potions this is invaluable to get all these spells casted before shifting when you run out. If mobs are susceptible to those spells nothing generally will survive this onslaught, they are making four saves per round or getting disabled, whilst you are immune. I got quite a bit of exp gain with this method. You can cast SoV and a summon without breaking invisibility, but other spells will break invisibility. Knockdown immunity is extremely valuable to get the combo off.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAgainst rogues and assassins (high reflex saves with evasion but poor fortitude and will saves) - Stonehold, Finger of death, Invisibility potion/Slay living, Drown. Usually little point casting evocation spells with reflex saves for 1/2 damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgainst mages - Invisibility potion + slay living/finger of death before buffs are up, if you can, otherwise grease can be quite effective<br/>\n<br/>\nAgainst constructs - Grease (sometimes they are not knockdown immune), Crumble (no save), Summons, Creeping doom (no save)<br/>\n<br/>\nAgainst undead - heal/mass heal, sunburst and sunbeam are probably good too but I've never had to use those spells<br/>\n<br/>\nAgainst single target animals or monsters - Hold animal or monster can be useful if they have a weak will save.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nHarm is good against everything that isn't spell resistant that you can get into melee range with<br/>\n<br/>\nAgainst spell resistant types (ie bosses, monks) - creeping doom will generally still work, otherwise its summons + animal companion, buffs to the hilt then either ranged weapon with zen archery or shift to elemental/bear form to do damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheese: creeping doom and invisibility potion.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps. Can't wait to see OoJ in its full glory!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Also, now I have the two toughest quests this side of lvl 38 to do. One boss will hit you with 100ish electric damage every second round or so. Another does the same, but with fire. My problem right now is I can't provide enough damage (even with Harm) before they wear me down. I think I might have to give up soloing these two bosses and find someone to travel with.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe companions have been buffed a bit on Blackstone, basically they have extreme AB so they always hit, but they need to be buffed in defence.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you Orion for the tips, some were known before, some not so much.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Update. The wild shape and the elemental shape is more or less worthless on Blackstone, due to two things: 1. Crazy immunities, saves and resistances on the bosses. 2. The high-level magic loot you can find, buy or craft. Basically, the bonii (bonuses?) on the gear you can get at lvl 22-23 are way better than the bonus you get from your elemental shape. Also, I'm not quite sure why not all the bonii transfer to the chosen shape, but according to people that has dragon shape, many will transfer to the dragon shape.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, now that I've gotten lvl 9 spells for my druid, it's a bit less hard to play. Will have some playing time this weekend, so I hope I can reach 33 and get my dragon shape soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I made a stupid mistake when I collected gear for this druid toon. I didn't think about the penalties to monk wisdom AC if you use shield, so I need to reconfigure my gear. A lot. Oh, well, live and learn.<br/>\n<br/>\nStonehold and empowered creeping doom works well against most critters.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The upside is that I have gloves with 3d10 extra damage that will transfer to the dragon.

I also have +12 WIS that I hope will transfer to the dragon. I also have two \"wands of quick buffing\" (great item, you cast all your buffs on it once, then you only use the wand once and get all your spell effects instantly) that will give me all my buffs before the fight. So, we'll see. Either way, there are only two or three builds on BSK (DD Fighter/Rogue, Wiz and Bard/Fighter/RDD) that can manage to solo the high-level areas and there are only one or two party combinations of those builds that can manage to clear out the highest bosses, so when you're bored with that fact, it's not important that you can kick ass, it's important that the build is interesting and fun.

Conclusions so far on BSK: <br/>\n<br/>\nThe druid/Cleric combo is actually way better than I thought. Can't wait to see what happens when I get the final monk level. It's fairly powerful if you max-buff your familiar (which are already buffed in general on BSK) and yourself, cast various combos of Stonehold, Inferno, Harm/Heal, Extended Creeping Doom and Storm of Vengeance depending on who you're fighting. You're pretty good as a fighter under those circumstances. <br/>\n<br/>\nSadly, it's like Valerfor predicted, the Dragon Shape is not as good as it would be in a low-magic environment. Still, against some mobs, you can really enjoy the awesome Dragon-ness. I'm going to craft some new uber-gloves or possibly scimitar (which will hopefully give better damage) and armor with 25% slashing immunity and see if I can improve my dragon a bit, but that's a long process to gather materials and such, so it will take a while. (Theoretically, I can make a weapon with three different +2d12, keen and 2d12 mass crit and +5 EB under the level 40 limit, but that's theoretically. No way the RNG gods will give me that. But we'll see what I can do.)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I love double spellbook builds myself, and I'm certain you'll love playing this one. It might not be as powerful as a Wizard hybrid (no Time Stop, no Mord, no IGMS, no Lesser Spell Breach....) but you'll have <em>a\u00a0</em><em>lot\u00a0</em>\u00a0of spell slots which you can actually fill with DC spells. Very satisfying.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would drop any of Expertise, IC:unarmed, or Empower Spell pre-epic if you want to make room for Scribe Scrolls. In my attempts at playing similar builds, I found that Empower has only two real uses: Blade Barrier (which is extremely strong) and filling your Druid 7/ Cleric8 /Druid 9 slots with Fire Storms for the style points (not so strong).\u00a0<br/>\nDepending how much power you are willing to take away from your dragonshape, you could go another route. You could even get rid of all three feats and get GSF evocation or conjuration, even.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom the epic feats, I have no doubts: Armor Skin goes. I think the ESF:Discipline idea is very good, actually!<br/>\n<br/>\nPro tip: you know those high-level rooms full of pesky spell-resistant Drows? 12 Earthquakes in a row will do.<br/>\nAbove all, have fun!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Cleric buffs give you up to +16 AB in this build (not to mention an extra 8 hard-to-resist damage).<br/>\nThe long answer is that these three classes synergize very very well (for instance, you take Cleric for the buffs and end up with a second DC spellbook).<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: good coordination, Max, good coordination indeed<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Order of Jormungandr is definitely the most advanced build of the 3. It is unquestionably the most powerful, but also the one with the highest skill cap. I'm not familiar with the Sneaky Archdruid, but I presume it's a Druid / Monk / Rogue or Druid / Monk / SD. Either way, it won't be as hard to play as this one. Champion of the Wilderness isn't that novice-friendly either, but I'd put it more halfway in the spectrum of complexity, since you only have 1 spellbook to concern yourself with, but at the same time that Monk level only comes after level 20, so as to avoid the loss of a BAB point.<br/>\n<br/>\nGrizzled Dwarflord's World Ender might be the most novice-friendly dragon build in recent history. I'd start with that one and move up in CR after you get the basics down.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
