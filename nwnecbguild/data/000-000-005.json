      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hi everyone!<br/>\n<br/>\nDoesntplayanymore (DPA) has created a brilliant search engine function to find builds with his programming skills whilst on his vacation.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuch a search engine is only as good as the data supplied to it. The ECB Filter currently covers 2011 to August 2019 and about 310 build entries which is great, but we can make it even better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the biggest improvement to the ECB filter would be to complete the dataset by adding the ECB archives 2002-2010. This is an additional 8-9 years worth of builds which would probably more than double the number of builds in the filter. Mithdradates for example, wrote 60-70+ builds on his own. Cinnabar Din, Grimnir, Grizzled_Dwarflord, Ithacan, Thax'ylssia, TyrTemplar are just a handful of other authors who have been very prolific.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy expanding the database, DPA will have created a comprehensive 'one stop' search engine to allow all NWN players to search for whatever ECB builds they would like. DPA has improved on the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/buildsearch/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/buil ... index.html</a> search engine so it would only make sense to enable his search engine to access this data.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've liaised with DPA about the idea and he is keen on it.<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine if DPA's search engine could search for example, approximately 1000 ECB builds? How powerful would that be?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dataset will be added in reverse chronological order (ie 2010, then 2009, then 2008 etc etc). The dataset will be limited to ECB builds only and the first part of the project will only include level 40 builds. Further parts of the project will be to include Level 20, Level 30 and Free Builds from the archives.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm happy to take responsibility for coordinating this, ensuring data validity with the search function, using my search skills to try to comprehensively identify all builds from a particular year and supplying it to the individuals doing data entry, and helping with data entry<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm a big believer in teamwork and Aquarius233 will be helping with data entry.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone else is interested in data entry please let me know! DPA was able to update 2.5 years worth of builds in about a day. I think there will be more builds closer to the games release date, so there will be more data to enter as we approach 2004-2006. Even so I think such a project will be completed rapidly with a few people on board, more hands make light work!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Addit 1 7/8/19:</strong><br/>\nHere is an example of some data entry for 2008 (I have given Aquarius 2010 and probably 2009). Please note Maximillan Kane wrote quite a few Holy Weaponmaster with Cheese versions, this is v2 (a charisma based version), the finalised version posted in the forum is STR based.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span class=\"inline-attachment\">\n<dl class=\"fileimage display\">\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/201908/10759084_dbc7b3917332ef13705693de8897843d_t.jpg\" />\n</dl>\n</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Addit 2: 7/8/19:</strong>\u00a0have entered 20 builds now. enjoyable reading through some of them. others just make my head spin lol. quite a few WM and AA builds I've read through in 2008.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Waiting a bit will synchronize with my own progress on the Archive since I have not even begun fetching anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother is: I may have time to create some tools to help with making the .xls lines. 1000 or so builds is no joke and I think not having to for instance fill out class level spread, some of the characterization, author name etc. for a few/some/most of the builds will be a big time saver.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nEven just making a GUI editor with boxes for everything so The Scriber doesn't have to interface with the slow and clunky excel program seems like an improvement.

From my perspective what you have done is essentially complete unless there is something that I'm not aware of, and any errors can be picked up in beta testing and fixed later. I see errors even in the ECB Archive as I trawl through it.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nTo give another example, Beamdog recently released a fix to the NWN EE enhanced edition\u00a0<br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>Beamdog wrote (on Steam):</strong><br/>\nC++: Thousands of cases of undefined behaviour have been addressed. A lot of code duplication has been removed in the process.</div></blockquote>\nAnd these are professionals! You're doing this on a voluntary basis in your spare time :) What you have done so far is just simply bloody awesome<br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>DoesntPlayAnymore:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nAnother is: I may have time to create some tools to help with making the .xls lines. 1000 or so builds is no joke and I think not having to for instance fill out class level spread, some of the characterization, author name etc. for a few/some/most of the builds will be a big time saver.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nEven just making a GUI editor with boxes for everything so The Scriber doesn't have to interface with the slow and clunky excel program seems like an improvement.

I think the important thing about any tool would be to check for dual build posts just in case human error causes one of the builds to be missed (in a later thread)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have 310 builds in the current filter, and that means only 690 odd (assuming there are 1000, that's just a educated guess intended to be\u00a0inspirational\u00a0, there could be less).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI was worried about overloading you with stuff so I didn't really push you for it\u00a0<br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>DoesntPlayAnymore:<br/>\n</strong>Lastly, I want to release something soon-ish. I don't want to wait several weeks before The Archive 2.0 comes out.</div></blockquote>\nThe release of the current search engine &amp; updated filter data doesn't have to be delayed by this new project to make the filter cover the Archives 2002-2010 - this the logical next step adding on top of what you are doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway from my perspective (like yourself) I'm keen to make the most of my time before I return to work in a few weeks so I've started collating a whole list of builds with links from the downloadable ECB Archives etc and going to start data entry soon<br/>\n<br/>\nI could get some help from you DPA - I'll send you a PM<br/>\n<br/>\nGlad you are taking a break from your project by the way!<br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>Kalistez :\u00a0</strong><br/>\nOne thing to be aware of is that many of the early builds were made prior to patch 1.69, and are therefore no longer legal.</div></blockquote>\nThanks for pointing that out, I have considered this. There is a checkbox in the data entry in the filter database which will comment whether a build is legal in 1.69. Maybe this should be added to the search engine. I'll add a comment to DPA's post.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
