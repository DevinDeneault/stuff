      "content": "<div>I made an original post here: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/fast-as-possible-battle-priest-build-needed-till-lvl-30-t515497-10.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/fast- ... 97-10.html</a> But I've tried to include everything in this one, so you shouldn't need to refer to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI play a female drow cleric of Lolth, that is the Matron Mother of a noble house of the drow city on Amia (for anyone that cares anything about the RP side). This is why I have certain limitations I have to work around. My current build is extremely weak, as I outlined in the above post. But since she is a faction leader, I will HAVE to get DM approval for a rebuild and it will HAVE to be RP appropriate. Now I can RP rationalize a great many things... so here goes <br/>\n<blockquote><div>\nWhy BG? And why in epic levels? It seems to offer nothing to the build. </div></blockquote>\nIn my previous build I actually took BG at level 11. I then abandoned the class because I realized I did not have the Cha modifiers to make it useful, and someone talked me into going epic cleric for the epic spells.\n<blockquote><div> <br/>\nWhat is your preferred weapon? Without fighter or a class that offers at least martial prof, your choices will be very limited. Warhammer is fine but the crit range is awful so we are back at PvP vs. PvM. </div></blockquote>\nI have no preferred weapon. I got stuck with the warhammer because I found one that gave bonus cleric slots, and then an underling went and found me one with good bonuses including Keen.\n<blockquote><div>\nWhy no fighter level pre-epic? You will need to be wasting a precious epic feat (clerics are feat-starved) on weapon specialization and could use that extra damage in early levels. </div></blockquote>\nOnly because I'm clueless \n<blockquote><div>\nPvP or PvM? No build can be MAXIMIZED for both, so choose one purpose and build for that. Otherwise, you will result in a compromised, all-purpose build that will never excel, never be a power build. </div></blockquote>\nPvP - While there is not a lot of PvP, Drow RP, and my char specifically, is all about political power. Most can be done by RP manuevering, but on the rare occasion that PvP is called for, I'd BETTER NOT FAIL!  \n<blockquote><div>\nIf PvP focus, what are your most principal adversaries' builds? Are there any PMs with at least 10 PM levels among them? </div></blockquote>\nPrimarily very high powered multi-class clerics. As far as I can tell, most use some kind of fighter/shifter/rogue/or bard mixture for skill dumps and added abilities. Of only slightly lower priority - Sneakers (Assassins, SDs). By PM I assume you mean Palemaster? No PMs are not a real threat as far as I know. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe following requirements and choices listed are based on server and RP requirements for this specific char/char type. I welcome any additional suggestions, as there might always be something I've overlooked.<br/>\n<br/>\nNOTES ON LEVELING PROGRESSION: Cleric is a prefered class for drow females and does not count toward XP penalties.

Heavy, blunt force dealt by a pommel or leaden arrow can temporarily stun a foe, leaving them vulnerable to a follow-up strike.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Shrill Strike</strong> - (Deafness) (Turn/Assassin, Fortitude)<br/>\nThe importance of the sense of hearing in combat is not lost on the Assassin. An attack upon the auditory organs leaves the ears of the Assassin's foe ringing painfully.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Beshaba's Favor</strong> - (-d4 all stats) (supernatural permanent, doesn\u2019t stack, Will)<br/>\nThe Assassin becomes adept at turning disadvantage to advantage, weakness into strength, bad luck into blessed fortune. Provided, that this misfortune falls upon the Assassin's victim.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Stalker's Throat-Dart</strong> - (Silence) (1 Round/Assassin, Fortitude)<br/>\nLanding a blow to the throat is one of the most difficult attacks an Assassin can make. By no chance, it is also one of the most rewarding.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Induce Amaurosis</strong> -  (Blindness) (1 Round/Assassin, Fortitude)<br/>\nThe Assassin knows that something as innocuous as a culinary spice can have more malign uses. Pepper, thrown into the eyes of the foe in the heat of battle, leaves them a bit burned.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Blade of Terror</strong> - (Paralysis) (1 Round/Assassin, Will)<br/>\nThe appalling viciousness of the Assassin's assault cows the target into submission. The assassin may make a death-attack that causes overwhelming fear to the target of this ability.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Bloodlet</strong> -  (Level Drain) (supernatural permanent stacks, Fortitude)<br/>\nThe Carotid and Femoral artery are prime targets for a cutting or piercing strike. An accurate slice can cause the most extreme case of profuse bleeding: untreated, such a strike is as good as a death-sentence.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Kneecapper's Knife</strong> - (Knockdown) (Rounds/3 Assassin, Reflex)<br/>\nThe legs are a promising, if difficult to hit, target. They are often more lightly armored than the torso, as even the most rigid plate armor has many joints and thin parts in its metal.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Murder</strong> -  (Death, Death Immunity ignored, Fortitude)<br/>\nThe most valuable and feared tool at the Assassin's disposal is not their famed agility or skill with blade or bow, but their knowledge of anatomy and flagrant disregard for the niceties of honorable combat. This attack leaves nothing about the Assassin's motives to question. A feint, a flash of steel from the shadows, or a careful shot: a strike made with the intent to bring their target down instantly, no matter the cost.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#008000\">Optional Epic Feats: </span>These feats must be taken as epic bonus feats on Assassin (level 14 or 18 Assassin).

The caster gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength, Constitution, and Dexterity for Turns/Level.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnholy Sword <br/>\n8 Blackguard levels, 14 Wisdom<br/>\nThis spell transforms the caster's melee weapon into a powerful Unholy Avenger, a specially blessed weapon that, when wielded by a Blackguard, acts as a +5 unholy weapon that dispels on hit for Rounds/Level<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:120%;line-height:normal\"><strong><span style=\"color:#008000\">CHAMPION OF TORM [LOLTH]:</span></strong></span><br/>\nChampion of Torm are no longer considered followers of Torm on Amia. Instead, the class has been changed be more general as a Divine Champion. Along with having a free range of deity choices, they are able to be of any alignment, and to meet the prerequisites, any Weapon Focus feat may be taken; they are not restricted to melee weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition, Divine Champions do not gain Smite Evil at level 3. In its place, they gain the Purge Infidel feat. Divine Champion levels do still stack for the damage of Smite Evil, even if they do not gain the feat anymore.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"color:#008000\">Feats:</span></strong> These feats are new to the Divine Champion class.<br/>\n<br/>\nPurge Infidel<br/>\nGained at 3rd level, it gives the Divine Champion the ability to gain bonus damage equal to their class level, for the duration of their Charisma modifer. The bonus damage however, works only against creatures and people who have a different alignment than the purging Divine Champion. Against opponents with same alignment as the purger, the Purge Infidel ability does not work.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:120%;line-height:normal\"><strong><span style=\"color:#008000\">SHADOWDANCER:</span></strong></span> ??might be an RP stretch??<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#008000\">Modified Feats:</span> These feats are modified from the default Shadowdancer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Hide in Plain Sight</strong> - This feat is gained at level 6, rather than level 1.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#008000\"><strong>Shadow Jump:</strong></span> - In an effort to make the Shadowdancer PrC more appealing the following two supernatural abilities have been added to Shadowdancer\u2019s repertoire:<br/>\n<br/>\nLesser Shadowjump: <br/>\nThis will enable you to teleport from shadow to shadow, four times per day. You must have at least 4 SD levels and received tutoring from a fellow Shadowdancer of level 10 or above.

I'd expect AB to get to at least 40 or above pretty easily with full buffs in place for mundane kukris and with a 15-20 crit range, 12-20 with keen kukris.  I usually cast Extended DP first and then follow up with Empowered Bull's to get the highest damage but you may have your own casting strategy.</div>"

For offensive spells, Maximize can be more useful, mostly with arcanists.  But we are considering a melee buffer here rather than a caster.  <br/>\n<br/>\nEmpowered can boost abilities up by +7 (+3 or +4 modifier depending on odd/even pre-buff level.)  Maximize guarantees +5 (+2 or +3 modifier depending on odd/even pre-buff level).  Also, you don't need to wait as long to gain the benefits of Empowered versions which start showing up 2 caster levels before Maximized versions.  The last reason is:  my preference.   \n<blockquote><div>\n2) Why do you need Bull's if you are using Weapon Finness?\n</div></blockquote>\nDamage.  You'll still be deriving the physical damage from the STR modifier regardless.  So, since DP gives you 18 (+4) automatically, then Empowered Bull's another STR+7 (if lucky), your damage will end up being +7.  Especially for low-base value weapons like kukri (1-4), it almost triples the amount of damage possible per hit.  (In this respect, I am ignoring the magical, divine &amp; fire damage adjuncts which are characteristic of ALL cleric builds.)<br/>\n<br/>\nRemember:  Depending on boosts from items it can become EXTREMELY easy for clerics to reach the +12 ability cap.  So slot the empowered versions where the increase will be of most value, addressing either AB/AC or damage by Cat's or Bull's respectively.  In my experience it has been more useful to wear STR-boosting items for a pre-buff dexer since a dispel against the AB will have a less significant effect on the overall attack (AB &amp; AC will still be very good while damage will all but disappear).  <br/>\n<br/>\nYou may find it a bit easier to use a single kukri with shield in early going until you get enough DEX &amp; HPs to sustain attacks even with TWF feat selected.  However, once you've gotten buffs like Magic Vestment, Shield of Faith and Extended Divine Favor slotted, you should be able to drop that shield with no discernible added hardship.<br/>\n<br/>\nKeep us posted as to how the build fares under PvP conditions on your server and the kinds of PCs you are facing since it is so dependent on an individual's implementation to become successful.  And good luck to you!</div>"
