      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Discussion:<br/>\nThis spellsword focuses on both \u201cspell\u201d and \u201csword\u201d as reliable weapons. 26 caster levels makes the buff spells immune to greater dispelling. The build has the ability to cast without restrictions, like any sorcerer, only in full armor for good AC. <br/>\nAutomatic still spell opens up for the \u201con the spot\u201d flexibility that metamagic feats give a sorcerer. <br/>\nThese kinds of spellswords are late bloomers, with full caster flexibility only after you get the auto still feats. With that in mind the character has a strong melee presence all the way from level 1 for full playability while waiting for the magic to mature.<br/>\n<br/>\nA \u201cnaked\u201d AB of 40 is better than most spellswords. Most listed builds have an AB between 32 and 38.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis 1-40 build goes for RDD 10 asap for easy levelling. The AB, level by level through the pre epic levels is close or equal to a normal fighter that starts with str 16 and takes weapon focus at lvl 1. You get 2 attacks at lvl 8 and 3 attacks at lvl 15, like a cleric or bard does. Draconic strength, the ability to cast from all arcane scrolls and access to caster gear helps make levelling easy while you wait for access to higher level magic.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome builds wait until near lvl 40 before they take RDD 10. That opens up for a discipline skilldump. I try to compensate for that with epic skill focus: discipline, ending with an effective unbuffed discipline of 45. That can be a bit low in the highest levels, but can be compensated for with items with a skill bonus or KD immunity and the fact that you have access to full sorcerer spellcasting at that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith 26 caster levels and greater spell penetration, the character pierces standard epic SR 32 equipment 95% of the time. <br/>\nIf you soften up your enemies with a breach spell or mordenkainen\u2019s disjunction, you will lower their SR in addition to stripping their defences. <br/>\nThe build does not have room for the high charisma and spell focus feats you need to get a high spell DC. The best you can hope for with buffs and items is a DC of 23-31, meaning you primarily have to focus on \u201cno save\u201d attack spells to guarantee an effective spell attack. <br/>\nYou will find a couple of popular spells that allow a saving throw on my suggested spell list, but you risk a high failure rate if you use them against anything but mobs. Spells that do half damage on a successful reflex save can be of some use though against creatures that don\u2019t have evasion.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hey Mick, I've read all your comments and strategies, which was good to see how to use this build. I have to say that I don't like that combo all that much, and some of your feat selections aren't much to my liking either. I do, however, like the idea of a Sorcerer 20+ RDD 10 spellsword. Here's what I would do differently:<br/>\n<br/>\n- I would go Bard instead of Paladin, lowering the AB a little and the saves a lot, but you can compensate that by having Protection from Spells as a lvl 7 spell. This way you would gain +4 AC from Tumble, UMD and a little stupid unimportant Bard Song which would compensate the AB lost by the dropping the Paladin class, if needed. Then you'd need to drop Toughness for Martial Weapons Proficiency, since bards only get simple weapons. There could be 2 alternative spreads for this build: 26/4/10 as is now, or 23/7/10, a little more dispellable. Since Charisma is also a Bard's primary casting ability, you'd have lvl 1 and 2 bard spells with 7 levels of Bards, easily dispellable, true, but not all that bad.<br/>\n<br/>\n- I would drop the Penetration feats because, as you said yourself, you can lower the enemy spell resistance to a point where all your spells can hurt them. I would replace those with either Blind fight or Craft Wand (more inclined towards Blind Fight) and Maximize Spell. <br/>\n<br/>\n- With the Bard instead of Paladin, you could go pre-epic Sorc 8 Bard 2 RDD 10 (or Sorc 6 Bard 4 RDD 10 if ya go with the second spread), granting Discipline dumps throughout the build with the remaining 2-3 Bard levels, at 22, 27 or 32 and then at 37-40. You could also get Epic Mage Armor instead of that Great Strength, and put that last point into Charisma to end up with 20. You'd lose another AB point, for at least +5 AC, not to mention freeing item slots for Nymph Cloaks, etc.. since you wont need rings of protection and such items to boost your AC. Your unbuffed AB would be 37, which is considerably lower than what you currently have, but more buffable, like I said, because of the much higher chance to cap your stats with items.<br/>\n<br/>\n- To get UMD I'd consider dropping concentration, since your AC will be high and you will have 50% concealment, or you can go into GS mode and buff up.<br/>\n<br/>\n- I wish there was a way to anticipate that Epic Warding spell, but if there is, I don't see it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, even though I personally don't like the class combo, I certainly think its a well conceived build. Let these suggestions be alternatives available to those who would like to try this toon,<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

With Wizard you neglect CHA in favor of INT, which is quite good as you get better skill points, and there are a lot of nice skills to take as bard (Taunt comes to mind). I know I am probably over the edge here, but why don't you make him have shitty HP and count on the fact that your AC will be very good and you will have DR to survive and up INT to 14? Then you could max out discipline AND Taunt at the cost of HP. There will be times where you'll wish you hadn't done it (I should know, my Magical Master build has 228 HP at lvl 40, which is pathetic), but then your build would be much better in melee fighting. Heck, you will recover the AB lost by going Bard through Taunts. With a high and very buffable CHA score, you shouldn't have issues taunting any melee-oriented foe. <br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, with bard and some Divine Power scrolls, this toon could be a beast. Maybe less of a beast than the one you mentioned, as you well pointed out, that one has feats to help increase the stats. Still, the way Sorcerer spellbook works may be better for spellswords, compensating for the lower stats, as you won't have to memorize spells. They'll just be at your disposal, which is a HUGE advantage. I often find myself having leftover memorized spells on my book with my magical master build, while in the need for others of the same level. You wouldn't suffer from that! You could at least try it on the training mod <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I have to say that I don't like that combo all that much, and some of your feat selections aren't much to my liking either. I do, however, like the idea of a Sorcerer 20+ RDD 10 spellsword. Here's what I would do differently:<br/>\n<br/>\n- I would go Bard instead of Paladin, lowering the AB a little and the saves a lot, but you can compensate that by having Protection from Spells as a lvl 7 spell. This way you would gain +4 AC from Tumble, UMD and a little stupid unimportant Bard Song which would compensate the AB lost by the dropping the Paladin class, if needed. Then you'd need to drop Toughness for Martial Weapons Proficiency, since bards only get simple weapons. There could be 2 alternative spreads for this build: 26/4/10 as is now, or 23/7/10, a little more dispellable. Since Charisma is also a Bard's primary casting ability, you'd have lvl 1 and 2 bard spells with 7 levels of Bards, easily dispellable, true, but not all that bad.</div></blockquote>\nThe focus of this build is to have both a high AB and a fair spell penetration. I put effort in that to make both spell attacks and the sword reliable weapons. I didn't want to rely on spamming Mords to be able to hit against standard toolkit SR. Adding a tumble class will cost AB and feats. That will shift the focus of the build. The AC is quite all right in most low/mid magic environments as is with the bonus from RDD and tumble x-classed. With the early access to arcane scrolls and gear, I seldom feel need for UMD.\n<blockquote><div>- I would drop the Penetration feats because, as you said yourself, you can lower the enemy spell resistance to a point where all your spells can hurt them. I would replace those with either Blind fight or Craft Wand (more inclined towards Blind Fight) and Maximize Spell. </div></blockquote>\nLowering caster levels to 23 and dropping the penetration feats will make you miss 40% of the time against SR 32. \n<blockquote><div>- With the Bard instead of Paladin, you could go pre-epic Sorc 8 Bard 2 RDD 10 (or Sorc 6 Bard 4 RDD 10 if ya go with the second spread), granting Discipline dumps throughout the build with the remaining 2-3 Bard levels, at 22, 27 or 32 and then at 37-40. </div></blockquote>\nSorc 8 bard2 rdd10 will drop pre epic bab to 12. Sorc 23 will cost a feat and be dispellable. Disipline can be a weakness in the build at some levels. Empowered bull's help some and I seldom have problems against mobs. Against bosses I use the bigby VI as knockdown or bigby IX as hold. \n<blockquote><div>You could also get Epic Mage Armor instead of that Great Strength, and put that last point into Charisma to end up with 20. You'd lose another AB point, for at least +5 AC, not to mention freeing item slots for Nymph Cloaks, etc.. since you wont need rings of protection and such items to boost your AC. Your unbuffed AB would be 37, which is considerably lower than what you currently have, but more buffable, like I said, because of the much higher chance to cap your stats with items.</div></blockquote>\nEMA is worth considering, but it will be at a price\n<blockquote><div>- To get UMD I'd consider dropping concentration, since your AC will be high and you will have 50% concealment, or you can go into GS mode and buff up.</div></blockquote>\nI prefer both spellcraft and concentration to UMD in an arcane build. I often take UMD in other builds to get access to arcane scrolls. Divine power scrolls would improve the situational AB by +6 for 7 rounds, but the build seems to do fine even without, and I don't want to sacrifice +3 or +4 regular AB to be able to get there.\n<blockquote><div>- I wish there was a way to anticipate that Epic Warding spell, but if there is, I don't see it.</div></blockquote>\nYes, so do I\n<blockquote><div>Well, even though I personally don't like the class combo, </div></blockquote>\nIs there anything other than the lack of tumble and UMD as class skills?\n<blockquote><div>//there are a lot of nice skills to take as bard (Taunt comes to mind). I know I am probably over the edge here, but why don't you make him have shitty HP and count on the fact that your AC will be very good and you will have DR to survive and up INT to 14? Then you could max out discipline AND Taunt at the cost of HP.// </div></blockquote>\nTaunt and discipline are both paladin class skills. You will get access to more skillpoints if you start out with Int 14 and Dex 8. Taking a late pal level for a skilldump will cost one sorc feat, but you wouldn't need the epic skill focus anymore. On the other hand, it is tempting to get both EMA and Epic spell penetration if one could find a way to free up a feat, but perhaps that is just wishful thinking.\n<blockquote><div>I certainly think its a well conceived build. Let these suggestions be alternatives available to those who would like to try this toon,<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div></blockquote>\nThanks again for feedback. Why don't you post a sorc/bard/rdd build in this forum or in the build request forum so that we can see what is possible with that class combo?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You could make pally here somewhat more useful by using Divine Might and Divine Shield as part of your combat strategy; dropping that last Great Strength at lvl 39 and getting EMA and +1 to Charisma with that last stat increase at 40, ending up with 32 STR and 20 CHA, gaining a few more spells (iirc at lvl 5 and 1), +1 to saves and, if going with DM and DS and able to cap CHA, +11 to AC and to damage for 11 rounds, which is not to be underestimated. You'd get 14 Turn Undead uses with a capped CHA that way, which means 7 times a day 11 round godliness.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>Taunt and discipline are both paladin class skills.

Perhaps you coudl start with Con 12, Int 14 and Dex 8 to make up for that. But by taking all your pally levels pre-epic (which I don't think can be helped), you can't focus on Taunt or discipline without changing the spread, even so because of the low skill points. Thing is that if you do go with DM / DS, the improvement is significant, and will make me like the class combo more. Sadly, keeping this spread, you have no more pally levels to make Taunt investments, so the INT increase I suggested in the bard variant would not be required or useful.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>Thanks again for feedback.

When the situation clears a bit, I will do that, thanks .<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
