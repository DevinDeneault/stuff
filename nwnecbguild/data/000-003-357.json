      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I think Empyre's suggestions are spot on. Blind Fight needs to be in there, the question is, at the expense of what? At first glance, I would drop Disarm, for 2 reasons:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- Disarm works best with 2-handed weapons, and Katanas are one-handed.<br/>\n2- Disarm without Improved Disarm generates an attack of opportunity for your enemy when you try to use it. <br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, Great Cleave without Devastating Critical is a bit useless. You're not going to kill many monsters in 1-round at that level, so the general rule is: you either take it for Devcrit, or, if it's disabled in your server, you don't take it. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can drop Great Cleave for Improved Disarm if you're really keen on having it, then you have to choose another feat to drop for Blind Fight, or you can drop Disarm for Blind Fight and then Great Cleave for something else, like Knockdown, which your build doesn't have, strangely. Is immunity to KD very common in your server? If so, then take Toughness for more HP. If not, drop Disarm for KD, delay Improved Critical a bit and take it earlier, then drop Great Cleave for Blind Fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also second Empyre's advice on skill dumps. This is one of the most essential things in character buildings. Not just what class you'll take, but WHEN will you take it. SD levels should be taken in levels that will allow your skill ranks in Tumble to reach multiples of 5. If you'd read my guide, you'd know this. See, being lazy has its setbacks lol <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the feat choice is cool in epics, but I'd take Fighter 7 and Fighter 8 RIGHT AFTER WM 13 for earlier EWS. I'd also consider taking that last SD level at 37 for the last Tumble dump so that you can have your clone for more levels. You'll lose a couple of Stealth points, but you'll have 2 of yourself, which is COOL.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
