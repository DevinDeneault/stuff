However, I have learned that this focus leaves the AC somewhat lacking (Massively) and the AB was rather reduced.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an Arelith character, each class chosen must have a minimum of 3 levels once selection for the first time.<br/>\n<br/>\n----- THE TO THE POINT BIT ----<br/>\n<br/>\nI would like a level 30 Build<br/>\n<br/>\nRace : Elf<br/>\nClass : Monk / Cleric<br/>\nWeapon : Duel Kama<br/>\nFocus : Melee / AC<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Even so I will suggest a tweak. <br/>\nEven though you loose 8 skill points, I believe it is easier to level the character if you take cleric first and get a quick developement of the spellcasting, let's say up to cleric lvl 9 or so (for extended divine power) before you take monk. With the cleric buffs in place, the AB will be good. Taking weapon focus can wait until later when you have weapon proficiency monk and can choose wf kama. Use a mace, dagger or sickle as finessable weapon until you have the monk wp.<br/>\nAC will eventually be good with cleric buffs and wisdom based AC from monk. Once you can buff dex and wis, and get AC up to a decent level, you run this guy in robes rater than armor. <br/>\nIt differs a bit from server to server at what level it is best to start wearing robes, depending on what gear is available.<br/>\nFor cat's grace and aura of vitality to boost dex, take war domain if you can.<br/>\nWith the cleric buffs AB and melee damage will rock!<br/>\nA weakness with this class combination for dexer characters is that you don't get the Uncanny dodge feat.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I am with Mick here. I would take the first Monk level after having 9 levels of Cleric. Levelling up a 10 str monk from 1-3 is INSANE IMO, unless you start at lvl 4 or something. I tried to level an 8 str monk past lvl 1 and wasnt able to without help from my friends, so I know what I am talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue what Mick says about UD, losing your DEX AC can be painful. My Wizard / Cleric / Monk suffered terribly from that when he faced HiPS or invisible monsters, or when he got blinded by a well-placed Word of Faith spell. You can always solve this by giving up 3 Monk levels and losing KD and IKD (and a bit of Monk speed) for 3 Rogue levels and gain Uncanny Dodge, Sneak Attack and access UMD. Just an idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Just noticed that the Cleric / Monk / Rogue variant would require some serious restructuring because of the 3 levels in a row server restriction. So, basically, if you decide to do that, go Cleric 15 straight, then take 3 Monk, 16, 17 and 18, then Cleric all the way to 25, (Cleric 22/Monk 3), then Rogue 3, and round up the build with the remaining Cleric level. That way you can get as much UMD as possible, getting the last Rogue level at 28, with -1 CHA, you'd have exactly 30 UMD, which is as high as it can get. Then round up the build with the last 2 Cleric levels. There is also the alternative of taking the 23rd Cleric level for the Bonus Feat and only then starting to take Rogue levels, but I prefer to take Rogue earlier, as the Tumble and UMD dumps alone will increase your battle prowess tremendously.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
