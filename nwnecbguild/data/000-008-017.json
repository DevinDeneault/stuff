At times the walls seemed to close in on his massive form, but the dwarven path was smooth and level. As much as he hated the puny earth dwellers, he had to admit they worked the stone well. Perhaps he would enslave some on his next raid and force them to build his fortress. The fire giant stroked his red beard thoughtfully as he paused to check on the status of his underlings -- hill giants, ugly and stupid. The mere sight of their misshapen yellow-gray fawning forms filled him with rage. Still, he supposed, they were the best he could find in this frigid wilderness. There was even a shaman among the group who had sworn fealty to him. They were struggling to drag along the logs he had taken from a grove a few hours ago. One those human tree lovers, what did they call them? Ah yes, a druid, had tried to stop him, but a few snaking vines and insects did not mean much to a group of six of giants. He left its broken form in the center of the grove as a warning to any who would challenge his will. Surtr laughed as a hill giant tripped over his cargo and stumbled clumsily against the ravine walls while the shaman brutishly barked orders from the rear trying to bring some order to the chaos around him. Perhaps when he had carved out his kingdom he would keep these buffoons around as entertainment.

Whether is sneaking through tall grass and trees in hide armor, or leading a charge in shining armor, he cuts down those who desecrate the pristine wilderness with a single blow from his mighty

Shield<br/>\nTrap Kits <br/>\n<br/>\nPrimeval Champion Advantages<br/>\nDevastating Critical. With a 41 DC and a high threat range weapon, the Primeval Champion can smite down the defilers of the wilderness who are vulnerable to critical hits.<br/>\n<br/>\nA 41 fortitude save. This should be good enough to make the devastating critical attack of most unbuffed characters. He also has little to fear from death magic.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes a lot of damage per hit. With epic weapon specialization, a high strength, favored enemies and bane of enemies. He can do a great deal of damage against his favored enemies and a fair bit of damage against normal opponents.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood AB. It could be better, but he has an AB over 40 while dual wielding medium weapons and a pretty good AB against his favored enemies. <br/>\n<br/>\nCan cast level 2 Ranger Spells. The ranger may have the worst spell list of any of the casting classes, but ultravision, protection from elements and cat's grace can be handy.<br/>\n<br/>\nPrimeval Champion Disadvantages<br/>\nHe has a limited number favored enemies. His enemies have been chosen to eliminate most of those who are immune to critical hits. He will have to rely on devastating critical to deal with those are not immune.<br/>\n<br/>\nMediocre hit points. With only 520 hit points, the Primeval Champion has to avoid protracted battles and use hit and fade tactics.<br/>\n<br/>\nLow will and reflex saves. The saves are not low enough to be ineffectual, but they could be higher.<br/>\n<br/>\nFavoured Spells<br/>\nLevel 1: Ultravision, Resist Elements<br/>\nLevel 2: Cat's Grace, Protection from Elements<br/>\n<br/>\nMagic Item Wish List<br/>\nMagical keen scimitars. Despite a good AB, the Primeval Champion could always benefit from a magical weapon. An extended threat range would also help him land his devastating critical attempts.<br/>\n<br/>\nImmunity to mind spells item. With a 24 will save (28 vs. spells) he may not be particularly vulnerable to will spells, but this will save is still too low to guarantee success against these spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nImmunity to critical hits item. This will help against high DC devastating critical attacks. Also, even if he makes his devastating critical save, those critical hits still hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaving throw boosting item. Even with a 41 fortitude saving throw, he's still vulnerable to devastating critical attacks (the highest possible DC is 53), he is also vulnerable to mind spells and fear auras.<br/>\n<br/>\nA permanently hasted item. Who would say no to an increased movement rate, +4 to AC and an extra attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nAC boosting items. With his mediocre hit points, a high AC is crucial to character like Primeval Champion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAB and Damage<br/>\nWith no buffs, normal scimitar:<br/>\n45/40/35/30 17+1D6 (15-20 X2)<br/>\n(47/42/37/32 23+3D6 (15-20 X2) vs. favored enemy)<br/>\nDevastating Critical DC 41 <br/>\n<br/>\nWith no buffs, light armor, two normal scimitars:<br/>\n41/36/31/26 17+1D6 (15-20 x2)<br/>\n41/36 11+1D6 (15-20 x2)<br/>\n(43/38/33/28 23+3D6 (15-20 x2)<br/>\n43/38 17+3D6 (15-20 x2) vs. favored enemy)<br/>\nDevastating Critical DC 41 <br/>\n<br/>\nWith +12 to STR and a +5 keen scimitar:<br/>\n56/51/46/41 28+1D6 (13-20 X2)<br/>\n(58/53/48/43 34+3D6 (13-20 X2) vs. favored enemy)<br/>\nDevastating Critical DC 47<br/>\n<br/>\nWith +12 to STR, light armor and two +5 keen scimitars:<br/>\n52/47/42/37 28+1D6 (13-20 x2)<br/>\n52/47 19+1D6 (13-20 x2)<br/>\n(54/49/44/39 34+3D6 (13-20 x2)<br/>\n54/49 25+3D6 (13-20 x2) vs. favored enemy)<br/>\nDevastating Critical DC 47 <br/>\n<br/>\nMaximum AB with scimitar 71 (73 vs. favored enemy)<br/>\nMaximum AB while dual wielding scimitars 67 (69 vs. favored enemy)<br/>\n<br/>\nAC<br/>\nWith full plate and tower shield): 26<br/>\nWith hide armor and +4 to dex from cat's grace): 21<br/>\nWith +5 full plate, +5 tower shield, +5 ring of protection, +5 amulet of natural armor and boots of speed: 50<br/>\nWith +12 to dex, +5 leather armor, +5 ring of protection, +5 amulet of natural armor and boots of speed: 41<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
