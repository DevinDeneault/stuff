      "content": "<div>First of all, since I really like Rangers, I like this way of thinking, and it looks interesting.\u00a0 Certainly combining Ranger and RDD is interesting.\u00a0 There is even a bit of synergy with the Cha boost and Animal Empathy (if one goes all 10 levels of RDD) and some extra Int for more skill points (always useful for a Ranger build, that has so many skill areas that can be covered - I like to call Rangers skill point starved).<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps for the Dev Crit version, take RDD to 10 levels.\u00a0 That would probably help mightily with the reqs for Dev Crit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand the need for lots of Ranger levels for FEs, but I do strongly feel that one can get more out of having two Bard levels - one to get some UMD, Tumble and RDD earlier, and the last level around 37 or so to top off Tumble and and last dabs to UMD, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know, it's like \"I just need some more levels here!\u00a0 We need more than 40 darnit!\"\u00a0 I really think that Bioware missed a clever synergy with Harper Scout not being able to combine the FEs with the Ranger stuff.\u00a0 Just thinking of the possibilities...*sigh*<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I really like this idea.\u00a0 Ranger I think is really a \"lost class\" so often...so much potential and promise, crippled with design decisions.</div>"

Add 6 more from Strength and 5 from a magic weapon you're at 36-53. Off- hand is lower by 9, but that's sweeeet damage. I have played High level ranger Weapon Masters and it's fun.
