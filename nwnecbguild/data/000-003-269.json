      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">That is a tough one, it is really a build that pretty much you gain nothing from switching to Human except the aesthetics of course. As you said already in WoG, craft wands is extremely helpful but for your other PW there is no clear substitute. Logic dictates that you take lightning reflexes or a skill focus, but personally i would take exotic for the coolness since you already went Human for that. Another option is to take a third spell focus in enchantment perhaps.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Fight unarmed <strong>without </strong>the Improved unarmed fight feat, so you provoke attacks of opportunity against you.<br/>\n Unless I knew that I would get an item with Knockdown immunity, I would pick Skill focus Discipline. The modified rank of 43 is a bit on the low side. I would be looking for items with a Discipline bonus.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I could always cross class a few ranks if needed, I have an abundance of skill points.<br/>\n<br/>\n Edit: \u00a0Does 3 ranks make that much difference ?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">You don't need any ranks in Discipline to take the Skill focus.<br/>\n A strength based warrior that maxes Discipline will normally have a modified Discipline rank in the 50's.<br/>\n<br/>\n A successful Discipline check allows the character to resist Knockdown. If I recall correctly, the DC is equal to the attacker's attack roll (1d20 + AB + size difference (+4 per size category)). To defend against Knockdown you roll an opposed check (1d20 + modified skill rank).<br/>\n As your skill rank becomes higher than the attacker's AB, you will gradually tilt the outcome in your favor.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
