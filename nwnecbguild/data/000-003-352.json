      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I'd like to extend you the welcome as well, and give you further info about our posting rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou need to post a build in a format that will make it easier to visualize. We have a standard for posting builds here, or you can just copy the Output tab of the CBC like we do, cuz it's very similar.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, as to the build, a build is MUCH MORE than just deciding Wizard 20 PM 10 SD 10. A build is ALL THE CHOICES you make, starting stats and stat increases, feat selection, skill point distribution and skill selection per level, leveling order. What you posted here is what we call THE SPREAD, which is basically the division of the forty levels between the classes you chose. So, as for the build itself, I'll help you out in the original topic once you post something more conclusive.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/a-complete-guide-to-the-basics-of-character-building-t515440.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">In this guide</a> you can find information on what it actually means to build a character, ECB standards. At the bottom of the post, you'll find a rough spreadsheet on which to fill in the information on your character, but there is a better tool, which is called the CBC (Character Build Calculator). It's an excel plan that makes all the calculations for you. You can find a link to download it and some other cool building tools <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/tools-of-the-builder-t515320.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll right, I think this is enough to get you started.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
