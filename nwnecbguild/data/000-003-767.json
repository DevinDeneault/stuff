Others will comment on the sorcerous qualities of this build, but I'd just like to throw my two bits in on the other stuff. That said, does that 24th level of Sorcerer trump the extra 1/- DR from 17 Barb? (Genuine question.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut more importantly, what is it with you Wogglers (Woggies, Woggers, etc)? Pay some attention to the early stuff! Knockdown at level 1? Really? And your chances of landing one? Come on, don't dis the pre-epics!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
