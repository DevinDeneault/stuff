      "content": "<div>Greetings mortals!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm trying to set up a new build that is not necessarily the optimized build, but fits my playing style and preferences, also considering I play on Blackstone, where you can get +12 CON, +12 STR, +10 Damage resistance against averything and weapons with +20AB/+10EB and a shitload of damages. What I would wish for is that you guys take a look and point out any obvious mistakes (that are not a matter of taste). Please?<br/>\n<br/>\nI've probably messed up the feats and one might discuss the weapon of choice, but Twin Katanas are so cool. (The best loot-weapon you can find on Blackstone is a Battleaxe with +2d10 Magical and +2d10 somethingelse, but it gets boring lugging around battleaxes on all your toons after a while....) I'm going to lug around a shield for low-level survivability and also for those extra +9AC that is useful on mid-high level. The high-level bosses is gonna hit me regardless, so that's where DPS comes in.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen it comes to skills, I need Discipline, UMD (for the wands that my Cleric makes me) and Tumble, but I want Lore/Heal/Search/Spot for playability (makes certain quests easier), that's why I waste 16 on INT instead of going for +1AB.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Fighter(15), Rogue(3), Weapon Master(22), Human\nSTR: 16 (32)\nCON: 10\nINT: 16\n\n01: Fighter(1): Dodge, Mobility, Weapon Proficiency Exotic\n03: Fighter(3): Expertise\n05: Fighter(5)\n07: Weapon Master(1): Weapon of Choice: Katana\n09: Weapon Master(3): Improved Critical: Katana\n11: Weapon Master(5)\n13: Weapon Master(7)\n15: Fighter(7): Two-Weapon Fighting\n17: Fighter(9)\n19: Fighter(11)\n21: Weapon Master(8): Blind Fight\n23: Rogue(2): {Evasion}\n25: Weapon Master(11)\n27: Weapon Master(13): Great Strength II, Overwhelming Critical: Katana, (STR=24)\n29: Weapon Master(15)\n31: Weapon Master(17)\n33: Weapon Master(19): Great Strength IV, Epic Weapon Focus: Katana, (STR=28)\n35: Weapon Master(21)\n37: Fighter(13)\n39: Rogue(3): Great Strength VI, {Uncanny Dodge I}, (STR=31)\n\nSkillpoints: 276\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +4\nAB (max, naked): 49 (melee), 32 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: \n\n\n01: Discipline(4), Heal(4), Intimidate(2), Lore(4), Spellcraft(2), Save(4), \n03: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(6), \n05: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Intimidate(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(8), \n07: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(14), \n09: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(22), \n11: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(30), \n13: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(38), \n15: Discipline(2), Heal(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), \n17: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(4), \n19: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(8), \n21: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(16), \n23: Search(5), Spellcraft(1), Spot(5), Tumble(10), UMD(10), Save(1), \n25: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(4), \n27: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(8), \n29: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(12), \n31: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(16), \n33: Discipline(1), Save(24), \n35: Discipline(1), Save(34), \n37: Discipline(1), Save(44), \n39: Search(12), Spot(16), Tumble(15), UMD(17), Save(1), \n\n</details></div>"

      "content": "<div>Hi Cornflower<br/>\nYour build looks strong.\u00a0<br/>\nCon 10 looks perhaps a bit weak, but since you can max it out with items, that helps a lot.<br/>\nI don't know if Fighter 15 gives you anything specific on Blackstone keep. Normally it doesn't. If you go Fighter 14/Rogue 4 instead of Fighter15/ Rogue 3 and takes Rogue on character level 1, you will gain 24 skill points, more than half way to be able to start out with Int 14 and still keep your skills. It will not affect BAB or AB since you already have a rogue level pre epic.<br/>\nDiscipline, Intimidate, Spellcraft and Tumble are as they should ( take 18 x-classed ranks in Spellcraft if you try Int 14)<br/>\nYou can save one! skill point on UMD and end it on 41 (40).\u00a0<br/>\nSo it boils down to how many ranks you want - or need - in Heal, Lore, Search and Spot.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for feats, the build is feat-starved even with 14 or 15 fighter levels, and you still have room for Armor skin in your build. You can solve that by dropping the exotic WP ( I know the dual Katanas look cool and everything, but even so...)<br/>\n<br/>\nPre epic I like to take Expertise before Mobility, and Weapon Specialization and Blind fight before Great Cleave. Much is dictated by the feats you need to qualify for Weapon master. But you don't necessarily need to take WM asap. That let you wait a bit with feats like Spring attack and WWA and adds some freedom when deciding when to take the different feats.\u00a0<br/>\nAs for Epic feats, your strength dictates when you can take Dev crit. I would add AS as a WM bonus feat. I would take EWF on the general feat at lvl 21( freed up from not going with WP Exotic), and I would give it some thought if I should take EWS before EP. It depends on what use +1 AB is compared with +4 damage in a WM build in a high magic PW.</div>",

I ask because in high magic settings the different AC sources often pile up to a total AC that makes it almost impossible to hit anything unless you roll a 20.</div>",

      "content": "<div>Well... Some thoughts from playing on BSK for years.<br/>\n<br/>\nAC is not relevant in the high-end game unless you get somewhere around 75-85, since bosses are gonna hit you anyway. Basically, if you can win the war of attrition through high damage and some relevant Damage Resistance, AC is not something to focus on. AC is relevant up to the high-level bosses and some high-level critters. I recently got creamed in three hits despite AC 77 when I stuck my nose in the wrong place. (100 physical damage + various elemental damages per hit.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAB is somewhat relevant since some high-end critters have high AC, but it's not that important with one or two points.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a dex-based AA that actually works rather well. In general dex-based builds work nicely, but even so, most people go for STR builds due to damage per second being more valuable than AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe latest fad right now is Fighter/Paladin/WM with three to five levels of Paladin just to get divine might and access to HA that will cut through boss resistances. Also various DD builds with high DR are fashionable.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, that's the bad things about BSK, you can't win against the high-end bosses unless you have a team with the perfect set-up of powerbuilds. It's very frustrating for me, since most other people are playing when I'm asleep, so I mostly solo, which gets me nowhere. So, what I'm trying to do is find builds that work well up to a certain point, but most importantly are FUN to play. Hence the somewhat unorthodox skill set in this case.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I think your comments and suggestions were very well thought out. I'll try to figure out what all the mysterious acronyms are and then apply it to my build. Thank you!</div>"

Starting with bonuses (bonii?):<br/>\n<br/>\nTypical weapons can have +20 AB, +10 EB, +5-1 EB depending on how good you are at crafting.<br/>\nMost items you can find or craft have +6AC as maximum. There are some few exceptions, but with around 20 toons and several years of play I have only ever seen one of those (if you manage to open the secret portal, you can visit a rural area where there are very high-level Attack Chickens, yes..., where there's a 1 in 1000 that they will drop a +10AC armor. I've never managed to kill more than a handful of those chickens, also I have forgotten which items you need to open the portal, so I won't get my hands on that armor anytime soon).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can craft items with 5% immunities (shield/helm) or 25% immunities (armor) against bludgeoning/piercing/slashing.<br/>\nYou can find items with 10 or 15 Damage reduction against various damages. Gloves with 15 Damage Resistance agasint slashing + piercing + bludgeoning comes to mind. Or a shield with 10 Damage Resistance against sonic+acid+electrical+fire.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can add abilities to any objects, so if you find a good cloak of protections, you can add a Forge Stone to it and give it INT+6 (only trouble is that which ability bonus you get is random) or something. You can add various things like Haste, Regen, Freedom, Holy Avenger, Divine Damage, Knockdown immunity, etc, etc, etc if you're good enough at crafting (80+). In any case, you can almost always max out 2 or 3 abilities on your toon if you can afford it. My Bard/BG/RDD at level 37 has AB47/AC67 and STR 49/DEX 10/CON 28/INT 12/CHA28 due to good items.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are variations of the big bads. Some have very high immunities, some score ridiculous damages, some have silly AB/AC. Those that I have most trouble with are those with really high AC and AB. There are several high-level critters with 80-85 AB or 80-85 AC. Occasional bosses have (or so I've heard) even higher. I'm not sure about 100 AB/AC, though. I've never gotten so close to those bosses that they left an imprint in my logs.... There are a couple of critters that have really bad damages, like: 100 physical damages + several d10 elemental damages / OnHit Harm / 100 magical damages per \"look\" (beholder mages).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general the only successful builds that can solo high-end areas are various DwDefenders, some dex-based Fighter/Monk and possibly the occasional well-played Wizard. Right now the forums are down, otherwise I could have linked the popular builds.</div>"
