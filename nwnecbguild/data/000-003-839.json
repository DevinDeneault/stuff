Having not found similar builds in the lv 20 pre-epic characters guild nor in this one (hope that I have not missed anything), I'll post it here for your comments and suggestions:<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCleric(9), Wizard(2), Arcane Archer(9), Elf<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 10<br/>\nDEX: 10<br/>\nCON: 12<br/>\nWIS: 18 (23)<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\nElf: (Hardiness vs. Enchantments, Keen Sense, Low-light Vision, Skill Affinity: Listen, Skill Affinity: Search, Skill Affinity: Spot, Sleeplessness)<br/>\n01: Cleric(1): Point Blank Shot, Domain Trickery, Domain Strength<br/>\n02: Cleric(2)<br/>\n03: Cleric(3): Weapon Focus: Longbow<br/>\n04: Cleric(4): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br/>\n05: Cleric(5)<br/>\n06: Cleric(6): Zen Archery<br/>\n07: Cleric(7)<br/>\n08: Cleric(8): WIS+1, (WIS=20)<br/>\n09: Cleric(9): Extend Spell<br/>\n10: Wizard(1): {Scribe Scroll}<br/>\n11: Arcane Archer(1)<br/>\n12: Arcane Archer(2): WIS+1, Knockdown, (WIS=21)<br/>\n13: Arcane Archer(3)<br/>\n14: Arcane Archer(4)<br/>\n15: Arcane Archer(5): Blind Fight<br/>\n16: Arcane Archer(6): WIS+1, (WIS=22)<br/>\n17: Arcane Archer(7)<br/>\n18: Arcane Archer(8): Called Shot<br/>\n19: Arcane Archer(9)<br/>\n20: Wizard(2): WIS+1, (WIS=23)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 172<br/>\nSkillpoints: 110<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 13/18/9<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +5, Mind Effects: +2<br/>\nBAB: 16<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 16 (melee), 28 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 12/23<br/>\nSpell Casting: Cleric(5),Wizard(1)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nConcentration 23(24), Heal 22(28), Listen 22(30), Spellcraft 23(25), Tumble 10(10)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Concentration(4), Heal(4), Spellcraft(4), Tumble(1), Save(2), <br/>\n02: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(1), <br/>\n03: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(2), <br/>\n04: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(1), <br/>\n05: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(2), <br/>\n06: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), Save(1), <br/>\n07: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(1), <br/>\n08: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(1), <br/>\n09: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(2), <br/>\n10: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Tumble(1), Save(2), <br/>\n11: Heal(1), Listen(3), Tumble(1), Save(2), <br/>\n12: Heal(1), Listen(5), Save(2), <br/>\n13: Heal(1), Listen(1), Tumble(1), Save(4), <br/>\n14: Heal(1), Listen(3), Save(6), <br/>\n15: Heal(1), Listen(1), Tumble(1), Save(8), <br/>\n16: Heal(1), Listen(1), Save(12), <br/>\n17: Heal(1), Listen(1), Tumble(1), Save(14), <br/>\n18: Heal(1), Listen(1), Save(18), <br/>\n19: Heal(1), Listen(6), Save(17), <br/>\n20: Concentration(10), Spellcraft(11)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI chose not to take empower spell, due to the fact that lv 4 slots (for empowered lv 2 buffs) should be already full (so many useful spells....).<br/>\n<br/>\nAdvantages:\n<ul>\n<li>Cleric buffs (many of these are +3, as 9th level is reached) and defensive spells will help for both ranged and melee battles (extended divine power: with strenght domain, I feel there is much more flexibility);</li>\n<li>High ranged AB;</li>\n<li>Strong Will save;</li>\n<li>High WIS means also bonus spell slots and a good DC for cleric offensive spells (Hammer of the gods, yeah, I'm thinking of you);</li>\n<li>No need for uncanny dodge (my nightmare for DEX builds);</li>\n<li>Full-plate brings much AC;</li>\n<li>Trickery domain (improved invisibility) helps avoiding melee attacks;</li>\n<li>Trickery domain can be replaced with plant, so there is a space free for a periapt of wisdom (if +4, 2 lv 4 slots can be obtained) due to barkskin (+3 Natural AC);</li>\n</ul>\n\nDisadvantages (hope that you can help me avoid the first):\n<ul>\n<li>Divine power not granting the extra attack at full-BAB (due to the high levels of AA);</li>\n<li>No rapid shot;</li>\n<li>Low STR means easy encumbrance (particularly if full plate is equipped: she/she will need to cast bull's strenght or find +STR items);</li>\n<li>Dispellable buffs at high levels (correct me if I am wrong).</li>\n</ul><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thank you for your advices!<br/>\n<br/>\nI decided to take knockdown to face wizards, as in high levels they tend to cast time stop and gain some turns over the fighter...however, I understand that if I don't have enough strenght, he/she will have the time to recover and, maybe, counterattack.<br/>\nHowever, I think you're right. Should it be much more useful to take called shot at lv 12 and, at 18, the improved critical feat (as an example).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor called shot: that feat save my live playing AL modules series. I didn't finish them, but I clearly remember that I defeated a drow priestess who was buffing, by spamming leg shots. She couldn't move almost at all and I was completely surprised by the power of this feat; hence, even if I know I don't make the most of it (as I don't have enough expertise and knowledge), I could be very happy to take it in earlier levels (at level 9, or first).<br/>\nCleric 10/Wizard 1/AA 9 is an interesting option to me as it would help for buff duration, as you already outlined (I took wiz even level only for the +1 to will save), but I won't reduce AA levels as I want to penetrate Premonition.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Cl17/R3, which is the power underneath such combination? I can only see taking a free greater spell focus feat...<br/>\n<br/>\nMick, I understand what you mean by saying: \"Even if your Tumble is cross classed, the dexterity and light armor will help you reach 15 to avoid AOO\u00a0 when moving.\", but, honestly, didn't thought of it. That means, if you know you will have a low AC (or a lower AC, considering environment and enemies), you have to face the threath by escaping attacks through movements.<br/>\nThis is a true option, considering that it grants rapid shot.<br/>\nReading through NWN Wiki, it would seem possible to delay the extend spell feat to arcane archer levels, but it would be too late...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
