Probably with a reason why but let's see if this can be viable. At least it gives me something to think about while WoG is down <br/>\n<br/>\nIt looks like this one will be really hard to level up, don't have much experience with bards though so i'm not sure. But my goal was a party buffer / melee damage dealer.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease comment on the basic viability of the setup and maybe feats that should we swapped out. Skills is fine as well because it lacks some points here and there. Keep in mind that this is a fast setup, i didn't optimize any leveling / choices at each level besides requirements at that point. If someone could do a level optimization that would be awesome, because i really lack the knowledge to it.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeats that i struggle with are impr crit or epic prowess but i had the idea that AB should not be a issue and more critical range would be fun. Also i took still spell to avoid combat issues, or well, it seems to be handy?<br/>\n<br/>\nBard(26), Fighter(4), Weapon Master(10), Human<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 16 (26)<br/>\nDEX: 14<br/>\nCON:

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi <br/>\n<br/>\nWas this build once a dex in development? *cheeky grin*  Because STR builds don't need weapon finesse. +1 feat<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a general rule you don;t want to be taking pre epic feats in epic levels, so I don;t like the imp crit:Gtswd there, but hey we have a spare feat now soooo move that to pre epic.  Now = +1 epic feat<br/>\n<br/>\n................<br/>\n<br/>\nI assume that with FTR giving you heavy armour prof you will be using it? If so, Dex 14 is a waste. Dex 12 is enough and really Dex8 is enough with potions or spell buffs. +2-6 stat points. WIS is doing not a lot at 10 either. 8 would give you another 2 stat points.  8 stat ponts means CON 14 and CHA 14 to start for +80HP, +2 fort save and two epic feats in the case of CHA. That means +3 epic feats<br/>\n<br/>\nand so, to answer one of your questions... Combat characters want Epic prowess. +1AB for one feat whereas you normally need two GT ABILITY feats to acheive a similar result. Blind fight is another feat missing. Melee characters hurt without this.  Now = +1 epic feat <br/>\n<br/>\n(...and breaking the pre epic in epic feat rule. *pout*)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut... I got a question... WHY WM10? The benefits stop at 7 unless you go 13+.  3 levels could be bard 29 for bonus feat, or extra FTR levels for bonus feat. (So yes, FTR6 is a better choice as you were thinking. Oh cool, we just got blind fight at a non general epic feat. *grin*   Now= +2 epic feats<br/>\n<br/>\n................<br/>\n<br/>\nLevelling wise, 12 bard pre epic would be +1 BAB, and ...\n <blockquote><div><strong>marshall wrote:</strong> but i had the idea that AB should not be a issue and more critical range would be fun. Also i took still spell to avoid combat issues, or well, it seems to be handy?\n</div></blockquote>\n\nCrit range of 13-20 is irrelevent if you need 15+ to hit . What I mean is, there's no auto hit for rolling a 20 on a crit, so the more you increase your threat range, the more you need a higher AB or you won't crit except against mobs. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'd argue that more AB and damage are always vital with WMs. Naked AB40 is the aim for a 3/4 BAB build like this. WM should be increasing it above that ideally, but bards are feat starved to begin with, never mind the requirements of WM stealing what feats they do have. 40 would be very acceptable with the added buffs and song of bard to elevate the base further. We gained 1 with EP. And we have 2 epic feats so two GT STR works nicely, no? AB40 <br/>\n<br/>\n...............<br/>\n<br/>\nFinal thought: Get more WM and FTR to pre epic lvls, boost that AB and get your feats earlier. Consider B25, (you still get the extra song boost and remain basically undispellable, just lose the bonus feat) and get FTR8 (where you regain the bonus feat, possibly). There's a lot you could do with your concept, (Gtswds always make me think about disarm opportunities) but bards will always be feat starved and yet are gorgeous to play anyway. *grin* <br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">WM 10 is doing basically nothign for you. Stop it at 7 and get another 2 FTR lvls (+1 feat, epic prowess) and another bard lvl (more skills and bardic power). Weapon Finesse has to go (for IC for example). Skills must be reworked. Tumble works in base ranks, multiples of five. You want 40 base ranks there. Perform must be maxed out, at the cost of some spellcraft ranks for example. UMD works in multiples of 5, modified ranks so your 34 modified ranks are counting on some cha enhancement to get to the 35 mark. Taunt is also a skill I'd max out. HPs are low, drop WIS to 8 and raise CON to 12. Toughness would further help too. STR 15, CHA 14 at the start will actually free up one ability increase in the form of an epic feat slot. I'd look into Craft Wand, BF and Toughness. Still spell can go if you get Craft Wand and one of BF and Toughness can benefit from the epic feat slot freed up by rearranging starting ability scores.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
