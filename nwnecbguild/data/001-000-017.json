      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">BTW, I think this will generally be a good thing. It will bring lots of people into the game and back to the game. Many people have trouble getting NWN to run on newer OSes and with recent hardware. Beamdog's version will, at the very least, run pretty much out-of-the-box, without tweaking compatibility and \"run as administrator\"-type settings.<br/>\n<br/>\nMoreover, having followed some of the Beamdog discussion and watched a couple of their NWN:EE podcasts, they are dedicated to preserving compatibility with community content. That is, most modules that run on NWN 1.69 will run as-is on NWN:EE. There are one or two things where that can't happen. (Apparently there are licensing issues with some media formats, so those may not play in community modules without conversion. BD's approach seems to be to go with non-proprietary formats, so that this issue doesn't come up again.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBeamdog has been fixing things that are broken. The Master Server will be (and apparently is already) back. They have been working with people in the NWN fan community (Shadooow who does the CPP 1.7x project, people from NWNx, AD from CEP 2.6x, etc.) and have been soliciting input. And, they have already fixed many known NWN issues (there is a list somewhere). <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, best of all IMO, with regard to fixes, the Beamdog approach has been: If it's actually broken or acting bizarrely, then we fix it; but, the emphasis is on <em>de</em>-hard-coding things that are hard-coded so that the community can address things that are really preferences. To me, that is the best approach. People who like NWN mostly as-is will get that. People who have been hankering for bigger changes like 3.5-style feats and classes will see that since the community will be able to code those. They are even talking about (not promising yet) things like pre-loading HAKs and so on so that new base classes are available at character creation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, all of that is good news, IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps less good is that, as has been the case in the past when new patches were released from Bioware, the client and server will have to be the same version. So, PWs that want to serve players with the new client will have to convert. A handful or two PWs are already running beta versions with NWN:EE (BD has made the pre-release version available to pre-order customers). That will cause some grumbling as people complain that the version of 1.69 that they bought from GOG for $5.99 is no longer supported by this or that PW. To me, spending another $20 on NWN is an easy call, given how much enjoyment I get from the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, the podcasts have been pretty interesting and (IMO) re-assuring for those worried about what Beamdog is planning for our beloved NWN. Trent Oster was one of the Bioware people who worked on NWN back in the day and he clearly really <em>gets</em> the game and why it's awesome. I am pretty excited about this.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'm still annoyed with EE that the enhancement was almost entirely on the back end and most the improvements are not seen. the advertisements i saw played to the graphics improvement when the reality is they didn't actually improve any graphics, the graphics just are more compatible with newer systems. For the common player, they spent $20 for effectivly what they had before. <br/>\n<br/>\nI get that beamdogworked hard on it... the release and advertisement just seemed misleading... Had they advertised it as an update to the backend and for all you players out there.... THE SERVER LIST IS FIXED AND WORKING!!!! Then i'd be like. Oh ya!\u00a0 But $20 for changes I mostly can't see.... ehhhh... if it was $10 i'd be more favorable.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">It's hard to compare it to something like Dota 2, which is a free online game run by Valve. It gets constant bug fixes\u00a0(like a patch every week minimum, possibly multiple every week) and new additions to game play. Sometimes it is patched so much, the patches cause problems and have to be 'repatched!\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe financial aspect is Dota is supported by community donations (in exchange for cosmetic items in game). The big fundraiser is a tournament called 'The International' which the community essentially donates money towards the prizepool for the players . Only 25% of donations are contributed towards this prize pool. The prize pool this year is nearly $25 million USD, and they are only halfway through the donation phase (53 days out of 110 - <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://dota2.prizetrac.kr/international2019\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://dota2.prizetrac.kr/international2019</a>). So Valve has raised about $100 million USD in approximately 50 days, and there is still time left for this get even higher. The issue here is Valve has so much income from their fundraising, are they doing enough with it? (The running joke for the players 'game is still in beta', 'Valve is still indie company with only 5 staff')<br/>\n<br/>\nI think NWN in comparison, even with a very loyal fanbase, has a very limited income stream for Beamdog, which seems to be the EE edition purchases and DLC? Like I got the EE edition on a Steam Sale. I cant remember how much exactly I paid for it, but it was probably less than $5 USD.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

As an example, those who play WoG may have noticed a couple of \"item design consultants\" (or similar) in the customization areas. Not a major thing, of course, but that wouldn't even be possible without extensions to the scripting system in EE.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, new releases have slowed tremendously and there are still lots of bugs to be addressed. That's disappointing to me. I can understand that Beamdog might want to hold off on some releases until bigger features are ready, such as the key holing in graphics and game playability across newer playforms. But, my preference would be to keep plugging away at actual bugs instead of trying to make NWN playable on people's phones. I couldn't care less about the latter. Well, of course I could, but we are at the point where very sensitive equipment is needed to detect any concern. ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, to be honest, I really prefer more bug fixes and \"opening\" hard-coded features (e.g. how many feats, skills, and combat mechanics work) to scripting over new modules and so on. I know that that sort of content is popular. But, the community has made great content and will make more, particularly as more becomes doable with the game. What is harder for the community to do is fix engine bugs and deal with hard-coded features.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Dual wielding keen scimitars, he one or two shotted everything that wasn't immune to crits including ancient dragons.

But most (or at least many) module and PW creators give crit immunity to bosses - much as they give them True Seeing and various other immunities. And you have to burn at least 3 otherwise pretty useless feats to get Dev Crit (what use Power Attack, Great Cleave and Overwhelming Critical in a strength-based build?), as well as hitting strength of at least 25 - thereby in all likelihood knackering your AC and will saves (unless you build carefully, of course <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" />). That's quite an investment!<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other end of the spectrum, is Epic Dodge also OP? Is HiPS? And don't even get me started on clerics' Harm or ba-bas' Terrifying Rage.

Dev Crit may well be a highly-powered feat (if you have a decent DC), but do we really want to say that it's ok for arcanists to insta-kill folk but we don't want to have meleers able to do the same? Talk about lack of balance...\n</div></blockquote>\nStag knows I've opened a can of worms here...\u00a0 or dug my self a big hole... sinking fast.... apologies...<br/>\n<br/>\nIn all seriousness Stag has some valid points. He has made significant efforts to explain it to me since I posted my comment which I sincerely appreciate. Its basically around casters and their ability to instant death enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example I've been having a great time as a druid spamming Finger of Deaths, Slay Living, Harm spells.\u00a0Sorcerers and Wizards can drink a Potion of Speed, cast Time Stop, Mord's to remove death magic immunity, lower their enemies levels and saves, then kill whoever they want. I haven't even started playing Clerics seriously, and they have Implosion (area of effect instant death which bypasses death magic immunity AND +3 spell DC).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yes Dev Crit is super strong like really strong. Some of the other spells are also super strong too.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIt takes a large amount of investment simply to have access to Devastating Critical. Strength 25+, and five feats (cleave,\u00a0great cleave,\u00a0improved critical,\u00a0overwhelming critical and power attack). On top of that, the player will want to increase the critical chance (improving the range from a 10% chance to a 55% chance with scimitar/rapier/kukri\u00a0weapon master ki critical and keen weapon) and succeed with a fortitude save (from sky high AB). Weapon master requirements include 6 feats (dodge, expertise, mobility, spring attack, weapon focus, whirlwind) plus 4 ranks of intimidate. So we are talking about taking a lot of feats and lots of investment for a very powerful ability.<br/>\n<br/>\nCompare that with a high Wisdom (say 36 unbuffed, 48 wisdom buffed) cleric with SF/GSF/ESF evocation running around with a potion of speed and invisibility. He sneaks up to a group he wants to kill, casts two implosion spells. AOE DC Fort save or death of 19+3+6+10+9 = 47. No death immunity. Two casts with the haste from the potion of speed. His investment is much lower than the fighter in this situation and he gets an area of effect instant death spell with a high Fort save required that bypasses death immunity.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Dev Crit I am no longer sure about. It's certainly a very strong ability. Whether it should be nerfed or not ... ? not sure.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe buff rogues or assassin or rangers. Give them an instant death skill too :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

For Rangers, given that the class has already been somewhat neutered in D&amp;D 3, it certainly wouldn't hurt to ramp up Bane of Enemies.

During single player I tried to both quicksave and standard save all the time. EE crashing whenever I played Aielund was super annoying. It is funny that playing WoG I no longer have the problem of crashes. Not sure why that is.

If not, you need to find wherever you put the steam version of NWN:EE and specifically the <strong>ovr</strong> folder.\u00a0 Inside that is\u00a0<strong>cls_stat_palema.2da </strong>which can be opened with notepad/wordpad etc. <br/>\n<br/>\nLook at that file and you see the AC bonuses are given one level later than they should be. All you need to do is move that \"2\" in the NaturalAC column one line higher and replace any blanks with **** . <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a known issue for Beamdog so it will get fixed but until then this temporary one will work.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

A couple of cosmetic changes were immediately evident upon launching. The main menu screen has changed and now when my PC is behind/under something which impedes the view of the PC, a hole appears in the obstacle as per the screenshot.

It's using half a gigabyte right now of RAM when I open windows task manager, and all I've got is Tapatalk and NWN Wiki open.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nRunning Microsoft Windows, I notice that I have to restart the computer after a period of time for whatever reason, (possibly inefficent code or something) if I find my performance drops. This seems to be more on my laptop than my desktop computer which is faster.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a discussion in the WoG forum about trying to improve the NWN performance on our computers and current server and my understand was performance might be helped by:<br/>\n- closing other programs like web browsers<br/>\n- consider memory upgrades if this is an issue<br/>\n- consider Linux because its more stable than MS Windows<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe Web or one of the other WoG players can correct me / add to this if I've missed anything here.<br/>\n<br/>\nUpgrading to the EE probably makes sense in terms of stability, like they have released a bunch of patches presumably looking at improving the code of the software but I'm honestly unsure how much bang for your buck you will get if some of the other stuff hasn't be utilised.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh and trialling NWN on Linux is something on my to-do list. I haven't done it yet, but it doesn't seem that hard. I believe Steam allows NWN to run on it, which is good. Presumably GoG will allow you to do the same.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Addit:</strong>\u00a0if you get the EE feel free to join myself, Grom, Web, Gkorjax, Ratty_Uk/Hoeder and others on WoG. It's a party server, solo is tough but doable (particularly with a bit of patience), Mick and Empyre are welcome too. It's all good fun.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way I had a total party kill (two of us, we were level 15) last night against a whirlwind attack using boss who did 120-150 damage on a critical hit!\u00a0Normally we just ignore whirlwind attacks on our builds heh :). \u00a0I bet he was a weapon master too, he did critical hits often!\u00a0I won't say where he is though to avoid spoilers, but even though we were all wiped out, I just had to marvel at the ingenuity of the person who designed the area. It was like.... 'Surprise!!!!' In addition we had improved invisibility and stoneskin up (from UMD)! In addition there was another boss who also nearly wiped us out from crippling strike. I was suddenly like - where's my strength? I'm encumbered!! Good times! I am very enlightened by that experience.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
