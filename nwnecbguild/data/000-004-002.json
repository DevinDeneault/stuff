I see. Sorry, I'd overlooked Tomi as well. From what I'm working on now, we've gone for a similar level order (which I had decided on looking at some other builds on the forums), but I've gone for the sling and left WF until epic.<br/>\n<br/>\n I feel like I should explain why I'm doing this a little bit more. You see, I like to take things apart and try to put them back together. It really helps me learn about the mindsest that some people would have had when making these builds, as well as why they made the decisions they did. For instance, I now know about the caster level of the improved invisibility of Assassins, which I didn't before I started, and that Self-Concealment wouldn't make sense on a build with this many Assassin levels.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Secondly, if I do decide to play this build, I have a reference I can\u00a0use that I've tailored to the way I'd like to play it.<br/>\n<br/>\n Like I said, I honestly want to get better at building toons. I think this is the best way for me to start, as well as asking you guys questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers!<br/>\n<br/>\n P.S Speaking of asking questions, could you\u00a0explain why you left SD\u00a0until 21?

      "content": "<div>Hey guys!<br/>\n<br/>\n Mick is right, you see! I am quite experienced (and not very modest as you can see lol), so I was able to understand\u00a0the reasoning behind his choices by looking at the build. He only has 20 levels, so he can't do one thing that is vital to do when POWERbuilding for level 40, which is building up BAB (for explanation on this, please read my Complete Guide to the Basics of Building in the Game Guides section). The leveling order and even level 20 spread would have probably been Rogue 12 Assassin 8 if Mick had 40 levels to play with, because the SD level would cost him a BAB point. I love the finesse with which he was able to attain both 50% concealment and 14 BAB by slightly bending the Rule of 4 and still got Shadow Daze as a small reward for his effort. UDAMAN Mick!<br/>\n<br/>\n I have to say, though, that Mick's pointed out Tomi build is not mine. It's actually Grimnir77's <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/515504/Tiny-Reaper-Rogue-13-Shadowdancer-1-Assassin-26#.VVUnOebbLmQ\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tiny Reaper</a> build which I \"borrowed\" with his consent because I thought it'd fit Tomi perfectly (and I needed to modify it a bit too because Tomi wields Kukris).<br/>\n<br/>\n I like your attitude CT! You're an ACTIVE LEARNER, such as myself, so if you want to chat about making builds, I'll be more than happy to help you out.

The second build gets earlier HIPS, gets better Death attack DC, has slightly lower sneak damage and slightly lower saves. Less rogue also means\u00a08 skillpoints less. The second build also gets Shadow evade (for what it's worth).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy original build has the skills needed for handling (recovering included) of all vanilla Deadly traps in a PvM setting. In a lvl 30 build handling of epic traps becomes an option. You need a modified Set trap skill of 45 to set epic traps. You want to max your search skill to detect them earlier (you need a modified search rank of 42 to detect vanilla epic traps immediately in PvM. To disarm those traps you need a modified rank of 38.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you ask me how I would\u00a0 convert\u00a0THIS build to a lvl 30 build,\u00a0my primary concern is to\u00a0stay true to the original concepts of the build.

The build benefits from the fact that halflings get a bonus to AB with slings and throwing weapons. You can always resort to melee, but you don't need to. HIPS is very good for crowd control. Rapiers are finessable medium sized weapons. Halflings and gnomes wield them as two-handers and cannot finesse them. And none of the 3 classes in this build has the shield proficiency.  Using traps is definitely an option. Wands, rods, mage weapons and other items with spells to cast also add to the versatility.</div>",
