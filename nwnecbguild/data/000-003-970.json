The 30 level max - is that for Arelith or somewhere else? Are there any changes/restrictions implemented where you play? How do you like to play? What do you think PDK would bring to the build? And so on...<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a read of the Build Request Guidelines - that should help.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Take instead one of the full tumble classes that also have UMD in their skill-set, such as rogue/ bard.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
