      "content": "<div>Hello All,<br/>\n<br/>\n I've been mulling around a Hin Monk/Rogue/CoT (or maybe Fighter for WS and thereby damage, if I can balance Monk and Fighter levels sensibly, which I doubt) level 40 DEX build, but before I start fully forming it I thought I'd best check this with you first. I appreciate that kama is a small weapon, and therefore okay for Halflings, but can a Hin successfully D-W them without hideous penalties? If it does attract penalties, would you say that losing Monk AB progression and APR would be offset by the efficacy of kukris or daggers, as tiny weapons?<br/>\n<br/>\n I suppose I'm trying to determine whether to go for D-W feats or not. Another alternative would be Elf, but that way XP penalties rear their ugly heads big time. And a Dwarf with Epic Dodge is always kewl. I know Human would be the \"sensible\" choice, but frankly I'm fed up with my own species atm.<br/>\n<br/>\n Btw, the only Hin Monk/Rogue/CoT I found in the legacy archive was Sidious Fell's Monk 20 / CoT 13 / Rog 7 - which is actually a Monk 20 / CoT 10 / Rog 10 build constructed by Syrath1001 during the course of the discussion. I also found a 2008 Empyre build as well, but it's Human: Skilled Monk (Rog13 / Monk 21 / CoT 6). I haven't found anything similar in Hip's Fantastic Contrapulator (Hin-Hurricane comes closest, at Monk 25 / CoT 10 / Rog 5, but obviously no ED).<br/>\n<br/>\n Or is the whole idea crap?</div>",

      "content": "<div>I've made these already.\u00a0 The net -1AB (halfling +1 plus -2 non-light penalty) never seemed an issue.\u00a0 It won't affect the AC, stealth and detection which is usually the main reason for going small to begin with.\u00a0 Well, that and Epic Dodge.\u00a0 Try building at either INT 12 or INT 13 depending on whether you need Expertise/IKD or not.\u00a0 The combo rog/mnk should be fairly skilled even without the human and extra INT skill boosts. But it depends how many warrior-class levels you stick in whether the skill set will be feasible for your needs or not.\u00a0 Personally, I just eat XP penalties when the build needs it.\u00a0 But building for SP is different than server play because, unless they scripted respawns, there's no easy way to get back any lost XP like there is playing a PW.<br/>\n<br/>\n There is no way I would give up the sweet monk progression let alone be pressed to multifocus into kama and some tiny weapon. This consideration assumes a DEX build of course since you'd be already vested into Ambi's DEX 15 prereq.\u00a0 With STR, I probably wouldn't be so fond of a small race seeing as how stealth would not be its forte'.<br/>\n<br/>\n If your UMD-ing monk can find Keen Edge scrolls, that would complete the picture nicely.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Thanks, Hip, that helps a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n While I don't pretend to be a fan of kamas (although a weird part of me would love to see\u00a0 a Half-Orc Barbarian / Black Guard giving them a try), I was looking to come up with a Dexer <em>I</em> could play that wasn't Mick's Halfling Champion (no offence to Mick, it's a lovely build that I hold very dear), and thumping just wasn't cutting it (pardon the pun), so I thought, \"hit the bad dudes a lot - the 2s and 3s will add up if I'm hard to hard myself\". Hence kama.<br/>\n<br/>\n I've ummed and ahhed a lot about splits - pretty much everything from Rog 10 / Monk 12 / CoT 18 to Rog 14 / Monk 20 / CoT 6, and lots of places in between. I knew I wanted at least Monk 9 / Rog 10 for ED, but was fairly flexible about other things. As it stands, I think Monk 20 / Rog 10 / CoT 10 is a pretty solid choice. I'm after nippy, hard to hit, hard to spell - a real bloody nuisance. I'm thinking \"wasp\" might feature in its heading!<br/>\n<br/>\n However, I digress. Dual kamas it is, then.<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and I put the subject here, rather than in the Build Request forum, because I <em>do</em> want to have a go at it myself - my hide's a lot tougher than it used to be! Right, where's my pencil...</div>",

      "content": "<div>Oh bloody hell, Hip - I was struggling enough as it was!<br/>\n<br/>\n Alright, so that's 13 Rogue minimum - and don't you dare talk me out of 20 Monk, it's the one thing I'm comfortable with!<br/>\n<br/>\n ...okay, I've had a bit of a think, and I reckon a Monk 20 / Rogue 14 / CoT 6 is do-able, but I'll have to do some severe examination as to to when I take CoT levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n Apologies, but I think further discussion probably does belong in the Build Request forum - after all, I was only asking about hairy-feets taking up a couple of farm implements initially. This is much more interesting, however! (Do please bear with me, I'll be soaking my head before a first posting there.)<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers</div>",
