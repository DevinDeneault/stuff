A wizard with 9 bonus feats normally isn't feat starved\n<blockquote><div>Ok,now I have it roughly worked out,no save spell,s,damage shields and umd for wands ,scrolls and robes etc.</div></blockquote>\nNo save spells?  If you plan on only casting spells that don't allow a save, you don't need any spell focus.<br/>\nSince you are a wizard, you don't need umd for wands and scrolls\n<blockquote><div>At the moment she has spell focus,Grt. spell focus and Epic spell focus,and Spell penetration,Grt,spell pen. and Epic spell pen.<br/>\nAlso Extend, maximize,empower and still for more slot,s.<br/>\nHowever,she will end up with 32 int,would it be worth dropping the focus line and/or the penetration line and just grabbing more Int? </div></blockquote>\nWith 35 caster-levels you don't need the penetration feats for piercing standard toolset SR (32). If you know that you will come across creatures with higher SR, you can take the feats you need to penetrate their SR. Dropping 2 fighter levels for wizard will also improve your penetration by 2.<br/>\nInt 38 is the max you can get with your setup. With Int 32, the DC of your spells will be 22 for lvl 1 spells and 30 for lvl 9 spells. If you take epic spell focus, the DCs for that school will be 28 for lvl 1 spells and 36 for lvl 9 spells.<br/>\nWith int 38 the DCs will be +3 better, but then you have to find room for 6 Great int feats. You have to start with int 18 and only take int at lvl up.<br/>\nWith int buffed to the cap (+12) the DC will improve by +6.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuggested feats:<br/>\nextend sp, silent sp, empower sp, max sp, quicken sp, craft wand, spell focus x2, g sp focus x2, epic s focus x2, Great int x8, epic mage armor, epic warding, leaving room for 1 more pre epic feat (2 if based on human character)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Mayhaps you need a more basic explanation...<br/>\n<br/>\nSpell Penetration increases your caster levels when trying to beat a certain SR. Maximum Toolset (non-character or custom boss with monk levels) SR is 32, so you should be able to beat them without the spell penetration line of feats. There are also spells that lower enemy SR in case you need them: Lesser Spell Breach, Greater Spell Breach and Mordenkainen's Disjunction (which lowers it by 10 points!!!!!!) in the Wizard spellbook and Nature's Balance which is a Druid spell and you should have access to it through scrolls and UMD.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for INT and Spell Focus, both affect the spell DC (the difficulty class the enemies have to beat in order not to suffer the effects of your spell). The higher your INT score, the higher your DCs, and you can further increase your spell DCs with the Spell Focus line of feats, just pick a school. I'd go for necromancy, because if they fail the save, they die, and if they succeed, generally speaking nothing happens (except Finger of Death, but even that one just does 3d6 negative energy damage, which is basically worthless). Wail of the Banshee, which is a 9th level area death spell, does nothing if the enemy makes the save. I would definitely prioritize the spell DCs even against some epic spells like Greater Ruin (which will no doubt have a lower DC than your high level SF school spells).<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
