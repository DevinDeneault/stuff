None of this is reflected in your character sheet.\u00a0 Pretty cool stuff. So as an example, if we take your unbuffed dragon with his 46 AB and you attack, say, another dragon, your first roll to hit may actually say 50 instead of 46.\u00a0 Since you have two claws and only one jaw, it seems like you are more likely to get this attack than that -2 which would be at a 44.\u00a0 Not sure how the engine determines which it will pick, but that\u2019s all hard-baked/hard-coded stuff in the engine.</em><br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>Beast Mode Dragon Saves*</strong> in Stance/Blood Frenzy/AoV<br/>\nFort: 42 (52)<br/>\nReflex: 33 (43)<br/>\nWill: 45

your character sheet in some situations.\u00a0 Here his AB is firing off at 58 because he is employing both of his +6 claws (but still suffering the -2 for size).</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Player\u2019s Commentary</strong><br/>\nThis was built and playtested in two environments \u2013 PGCC and the World of Greyhawk Action Server.\u00a0 I would love to try other environments but time is never on my side.\u00a0 Druids are sometimes misrepresented as the weaker of the caster classes, but it is my opinion they are one of the strongest.\u00a0 True, this combo does not get concealment, or UMD, or knockdown, but he never really needs it.\u00a0 He already has the best knockdown ability in the game \u2013 Grease \u2013 and it stacks with other Greases (Greasi?).\u00a0 He completely controls the battlefield with just 3 spells \u2013 Grease, Stonehold, and Storm of Vengeance, all Conjuration spells, and he sports great DCs in this category to make your opponents fail this sooner or later.\u00a0 Even mighty ancient dragons will fall down and go boom on your Greases.\u00a0 Don\u2019t be afraid to pepper the battlefield with everything you have.\u00a0 I have been known to cast 4 or 5 Storms of Vengeance at once, all in the same area.\u00a0 When I do that, typically there is nothing left but ashes and shadows burned into the stones.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nYou may drop the 33<sup>rd</sup> druid level for another level of Monk (perhaps to spread out a bit in Epic levels), but I didn\u2019t have any use for it.\u00a0 You only get Deflect Arrow for your troubles, while that 33<sup>rd</sup> level of Druid gives you more spell penetration, longer durations on everything, nets you another round on your Grease spells, and a slightly tougher Companion.\u00a0 <br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nDwarven Defender was woven into this build whose goal was to acquire Defensive Awareness (I and II) to give both your caster and your dragon the ability to not be flanked or get caught flat-footed (that dragon has lots of juicy Dex AC so you want to keep it if you can).\u00a0 I could have stopped at DwD5, but DwD6 was sitting right there with 3/- DR so why not?<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nThe dragon shape is quite formidable in melee, though his breath weapon is only of the ancient variety.\u00a0 If you want a breath weapon dragon, that will be a different build.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nRegarding Dragon Shape, it is important to remember that only 3 things will merge when you shift \u2013 your Armor, your Helmet, and your Shield.\u00a0 You\u2019ll want to equip your favorite shield just prior to merging.\u00a0 Don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t lose your Monk AC when you shift.\u00a0 Seek out those 3 items which have the most favorable properties for you while shifted.\u00a0 Regardless of your AC sources, only the highest enhancement bonus will be used from either your armor or shield.\u00a0 <br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nAnd if by some strange fate you die while in Dragon Shape, make sure to unequip and re-equip all of your items (the game doesn\u2019t seem to think you have them on when you die in Dragon form).<br/>\nIf you find yourself in a battle where either you have depleted all of your spells, or you aregoing against enemy where they are of no avail, they you make the shift to the dragon color of your choice and lay waste with your 6-8 attacks per round.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nOther Builds with these classes: there are very few, and most of them are now illegal by either 1.69/EE standards because they only took 14 or 17 Druid to acquire Dragon Shape.\u00a0 <br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build257125.html#\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dragon of the Stone Halls</a>:\u00a0 Druid17/DwD22/Monk1, this one only achieves 17 Druid levels and majors in DwD for the DR (and also probably not street legal)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\"
