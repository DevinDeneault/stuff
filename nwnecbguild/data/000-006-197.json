style=\"color:#000000\">This build is very melee oriented and can rape anything if it can arrive in contact. That's why he fears magic users and their Bigby's a lot and all the characters than don't follow the rules of a standard fight (archers, hit and run ...). He is also very weak against magic effects because of his weak saves and the lake of self magic protections. That's why he can make wonders in a group who can buff him.</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color:#000000\">Only the rogue's UMD can offer him a new horizon according to the PW you play in.</span><br/>\n<br/>\nRogue :\u00a0mainly offer skills and UMD skill particularly<br/>\n 1st level rogue allows many many skill points, but we lose 1 BAB, which is unimportant in this build<br/>\n Rogue levels are spread to allow tumble to improve regularly<br/>\n Offers a 3d6 sneak attack which is rather a cherry<br/>\n<br/>\nFighter :<span style=\"color:#000000\">\u00a0makes the build construction comfortable thanks to all the feats it offers</span><br/>\n Offers the many feats needed to become Weapon master and unock dev crit.

It will make you a really BIG hitter<br/>\n Adds AB which allows even the low AB attacks to hit<br/>\n Improves crit range and crit multiplier<br/>\n Offers many feats at epic levels<br/>\n<br/>\n In case Dev crit is not allowed in your PW, the build should be moved into Ftr 5 / Rog 10, WM 25 as 5 feats are no longer needed and rogue 10 has so many good things to offer. But that's another build :).<br/>\n<br/>\n I chose the bastard sword because hammer is for carpenters, axe for wood cutters ans long sword for simple soldier ... we are more than that !<br/>\n But if you want to be more effective against high DR, warhammer and battleaxe offer a better crit multiplier and you gain one feat.<br/>\n If you like really huge numbers, drop the one handed weapon and the shield to take a scythe and go make widows !<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks for reading.<br/>\n Feel free to help me with your remarks and corrections !<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#FF8C00\">[Edit] took into account HipRedux's remarks, comments and some improvement propositions.</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<em><span style=\"color:#000000\">edit: per Hip 20160909 (minor: Normal capitalization, title)</span></em><br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>Well, from top to bottom... <ul><li>Refrain from listing pedestrian traits (i.e. 3d6 sneaks) as PROs because they contribute little to the build's major advantages.</li> <li>This build really doesn't have many skills for a rogue if you look around at other rogue dump builds. (It doesn't even have Disable or Search to deal with traps which is fairly normal for a rogue build.)</li> <li>List the DevCrit DC: 41, 47 w/capped STR.\u00a0 That's an official \"PRO\" of this build.</li> <li>Your AC isn't really a CON if it's status quo.\u00a0 Sword and board, especially in Expertise mode is pretty safe.</li> <li>There is never XP penalty for any human build using at least one prestige class. Dunno where you got the idea that this build had any.\u00a0 You would run into a penalty as a dwarf, but this is not a dwarf.</li> </ul> Now to the build choices themselves...<br/>\n<br/>\n Weapon choice.\u00a0 With any optimized DevCrit build, you want the APR as high as possible. Any comparable DW variant of this concept will rip this to shreds by shear probability.<br/>\n Check out Mick's DW STR Kukrimaster (referenced in the similar builds comments) to see what I mean.\u00a0 Crit range only matters for the easier ACs but APR ALWAYS makes a difference.<br/>\n If going with either a 1h/shield or 2-hand weapon (not two-sided), it's usually more efficient to focus on damage rather than crits per round.\u00a0 That's usually something like Dwarven Waraxe/shield or Greataxe/Scythe.<br/>\n \u00a0<br/>\n I would take EWS right after you reach STR 25.\u00a0 There's no benefit in postponing Ftr10 that long and actually get a slightly higher Listen skill with WM at Level 40.<br/>\n<br/>\n Skill allocation could be managed better to address one of the build's weaknesses: Saves.<br/>\n<br/>\n Here's what I recommend:\u00a0 Set UMD at 34(33) which will cast all Level 9 spells by scroll w/o failure.<br/>\n Take those 8 points plus all the Set Trap ranks (like I said, without Search and Disable, what's the point?) and take 23 xclass ranks in Spellcraft. With your INT mod you will gain +5 saves vs. spells.<br/>\n If you are still devoted to set traps, all you need is 13 ranks plus 2 from the DEX mod to set all deadly except gas.\u00a0 Gas have a horrible DC for the relative skill investment.<br/>\n You'll need to unequip your armor/shield to set deadly traps of course.\u00a0 In any case, invest all the spare points you can into Spellcraft.\u00a0 IMO setting traps is a luxury for a WM.\u00a0 Fighting around your AoE traps in melee can become dangerous.\u00a0 Waving that sword in the air will not pull opponents into your trap field very well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a few similar and superior ftr/rog/wm builds around.<br/>\n<br/>\n Here are two I found posted to the ECB:<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2353598/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#0000FF\">Kukri Saint: Fighter 12/ WM 25/ Rogue 3</span></a></strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/522762/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#0000FF\">Weapon Specialist V2: Rogue 4/Fighter 14/WeaponMaster 22</span></a></strong><br/>\n<br/>\n Here are a few legacy builds (if you haven't installed the Javascript Search on your local machine to find them I highly recommend you do so):<br/>\n<br/>\n Stalwart Warrior fighter 8 / rogue 7 / weapon master 25 (dwarf) by Cinnabar Din<br/>\n Master of the Deathaxe v.2 fighter 8 / rogue 10 / weapon master 22 (dwarf) by Kail Pendragon<br/>\n Shin Slasher fighter 8 / rogue 13 / weapon master 19 (halfling) by Mithdradates<br/>\n The Enforcer fighter 10 / rogue 2 / weapon master 28 (human?) by Mithdradates<br/>\n<strong>The Skilled Swordsman fighter 10 / rogue 5 / weapon master 25 (human) by NolDrek</strong><br/>\n Blade of the Reaper fighter 11 / rogue 4 / weapon master 25 (human) by Big Meph<br/>\n TwinBlade fighter 12 / rogue 3 / weapon master 25 (human) by pocketbeetle<br/>\n The Forest Outlaw Staff Master fighter 12 / rogue 3 / weapon master 25 (human) by EROMB<br/>\n Fighter10/WM28/Rogue2 fighter 10 / weapon master 28 / rogue 2 (dwarf?) by ChristianJock007<br/>\n Gnarlic the Brute fighter 10 / weapon master 28 / rogue 2 (half-orc) by Zhoreb<br/>\n The Two-Fisted Weaponmaster fighter 10 / weapon master 28 / rogue 2 (human) by Kaliban99<br/>\n Dwarven Decimator fighter 10 / weapon master 28 / rogue 2 (dwarf) by LordAshton<br/>\n Revised Halfling Daggermaster fighter 11 / weapon master 28 / rogue 1 (halfling) by Zhoreb<br/>\n Halfling Daggermaster fighter 12 / weapon master 25 / rogue 3 (halfling) by Zhoreb<br/>\n Dwarven Avenger fighter 12 / weapon master 25 / rogue 3 (dwarf) by Veridious<br/>\n Skilled Melee Tank rogue 10 / fighter 8 / weapon master 22 (human) by Empyre65<br/>\n Versatile Weaponmaster rogue 13 / fighter 8 / weapon master 19 (human) by Jennalee<br/>\n A Taste of Their Own Medicine rogue 3 / weapon master 25 / fighter 12 (elf) by Ithacan<br/>\n<br/>\nNow for overall comments about your build format:<br/>\n<br/>\n It appears you use the CBC to generate your listing so have access to the skill allocation table.\u00a0 Please use it.\u00a0 It's a HUGE timesaver compared to doing this manually or by trial-and-error.<br/>\n Builds posted in the completed and tested section(s) are considered \"Plug-and-Play\" so that players who wish to begin using your build can hit the ground running and do not need to muck around figuring out when to save skill points and how many to dump.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n It's assumed you have tested every submission for PvM at least in a trainer from Level 1 to Level 40 since you've listed \"playable from 1-40\" which you couldn't claim unless you have actually played it through the entire range.\u00a0 So you should have intimate knowledge of which skills to allocate for each level already.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'll grant a few days chance for you to ammend a Skill Schedule to complete this build else move it to the unfinished section until all build information has been furnished.<br/>\n<br/>\n It's a good first effort so stick with it. I do like the way you avoided that lame Epic Toughness feat with DevCrit. Kudos! If you find any of my comments about slight changes applicable, feel free to incorporate them as your own build without any credit. I am more interested in contributions being optimized for most environments than expressing my own biases.\u00a0 Good luck!<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hi Earthcore, good to meet you! <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/11.gif\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n First off, if Hip's happy, all is good. I do have a couple of musings, though (and I ain't no skilled builder, so take them for what they are)...<br/>\n<br/>\n About the skills: unless you're playing in an ultra-rich environment, the modified 33 ranks of UMD seems like a good idea, which would free up 8 points for you, and Heal is, I believe, not terribly useful (unless you're going with a companion/henchman, and even then...), so I reckon you could lose a few points there - 2 would give the necessary points to get cross-classed Spellcraft up to Hip's recommended 23 points - further boosting your saves v spells. And do you really expect to be so heavily Taunted that you need so much invested in Concentration? I ask particularly because, as you say, this is a melee-orientated build, so presumably you'll be using your UMD buffs before going into combat, when Taunt isn't an issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n I flag that because there may be a case for starting with Fighter at level 1, then Rogue at 2 (which would allow for a straight 5 in Tumble), then following your schemata. You would, of course, lose skill points (though as well as the above I, personally, think Listen to the extent you've taken it is more of a luxury than a necessity in PvM/E), but you'd be able to take WS before level 6 because of the extra feat you'd gain at level 1, and bring Great Cleave into the pre-epic mix - again freeing EWF and EWS to come in earlier.<br/>\n<br/>\n Your call, though, my friend!<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and you've upset the hell out of me - this is a country mile better than my first build <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/14.gif\"/>. Congratulations!</div>",

      "content": "<div>Hello,<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#000000\">Nice to meet you too Stagmeister !<br/>\n The point in having F10 in the early 20's is a choice between having earlier +4 dmg vs concentration skill (because if concentration is not 42/43, there is no need to take it). According to me it's up to each player's playstyle : confort vs optimization. In my point of view, I prefer suffering and having a better char at 40. After lv 20 I already have a very nice AB, WS, 7+ WM levels and I am STR based : damage is already very good and you certainly won't need 4 more damages to do more damage that a lot of other classes. On the other hand, may be you will never face a pally or a taunting mob at 40 !\u00a0<img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/8.gif\"/> and concentration will really be unusefull. But in case you meet one, I prefer being fully prepared because concentation can be the difference between a victory and a defeat.<br/>\n<br/>\n I would gain no skill switching Rog1 Ftr2 into Ftr1 Rog2. Just trading skill points for early tumble which is not worth it in my opinion. The feat I gain at lv 1 is lost at lv 2. Having WS earlier implies replacing the rogue level by a fighter level ... so you lose the Rog1 skill points.<br/>\n<br/>\n I love listen a lot but rather to spot players because you're right, it souldn't be that useful in PvM. I want to point out that even in PvM environment, players sometimes like to PvP, and although this build wasn't PvP tested, listen can allow to detect hiden and eventualy invisible creatures : an invisible mage is rarely silent when running, but thinks he is safe if you don't have true seeing or see invisibility : show him he is wrong !\u00a0<img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/9.gif\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n I'm just thinking about how to raise a crossclass skill to 23 ...</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color:#000000\">I just tried on a personal test module and I only reached 21. That's why I limited spellcraft to 18(+2).</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color:#000000\">Have I missed something ?</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#000000\">Once I have your response I'll edit the build definitely.</span></div>"

PvP, not usually. Most wizards use high stealth (if they are smart) since they have the skill points to spread around and usually dump to either rogue, assassin or monk.\u00a0 In PvP, they all use Greater Sanctuary while venturing to prevent being targeted.\u00a0 Not so much for sorcs seeing as they are relatively unskilled.\u00a0 Just make sure that when you spot something invisible it's not their pre-buffed familiar because you are about to get Bigby'd or stormed with missiles.</span>\n<blockquote><div>\n<span style=\"color:#000000\">I'm just thinking about how to raise a crossclass skill to 23 ...</span><br/>\n<span style=\"color:#000000\">I just tried on a personal test module and I only reached 21.
