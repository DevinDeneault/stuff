      "content": "<div>Firstly I am not the greatest AA, Bard or Assassin player but I would say this looks solid MentalDekay!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe AB is delightful at 54. Assassin 11 is pretty solid to access the very special Assassin's Improved Invisibility. Plus UMD<br/>\n<br/>\nTo me this seems like a very strong and playable build! Well done<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you wanted some minor improvements then I have a handful of suggestions but feel free to ignore them if you wish<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>I think Blind Fight should be in the build to help deal with enemies with concealment\nOther nice feats would be Toughness, Called shot, Resist Energy feats (If possible, not sure if you have enough fortitude to get it) or Luck of Heroes\nI think Dodge and Mobility might not be the best feats to take in this build as one's AC will be very high from the dex score plus protected by Uncanny Dodge from assassin. Also extra music seems low value with a level 6 Bard song.\u00a0\nYour pre-epic split is Bard 5 / Assassin 5 / AA 10, which could be optimised to Bard 6 / Assassin 4 / AA 10 for +1 BAB. Then take the Assassin 5 level at level 21 for the skill dump.\u00a0\nAssassin 9 is a pretty strong power spike on paper, and I would suggest getting that asap epic levels, if possible\n</details></div>"
