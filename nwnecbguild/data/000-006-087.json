The details of this calamity are unclear, except the fertile heartlands of the Baklunish empire were transformed into the Dry Steppes, her great cities and rivers now entirely gone. There are not even ruins to mark the graves of ancient Baklunish civilization; Tovag Baragu stands alone where there was once a capital city.\u00a0 The kingdoms of the dwarves in the northern Crystalmists and Sulhauts were also devastated, and the legendary Axe of the Dwarven Lords was lost.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nIn retribution, the magi-priests of the Bakluni gathered within the stone circles of Tovag Baragu and conjured a mighty working, bringing down the terrible <strong>Rain of Colorless Fire</strong> upon the Suloise basin. This Rain burned people, buildings, even rocks and soil to ash, leaving the Sea of Dust as a monument to the hubris of Man. Together, the Invoked Devastation and the Rain of Colorless Fire are known as the Twin Cataclysms.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nAnd thus ended the Baklunish-Suloise Wars.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nThose few Bakluni who survived were the wayward mystics, ascendant priests, and oracles of the Baklunish goddess of Fate, Time and Space, The Lady of Our Fate, the Colorless and the All-Colored\u2014Istus.\u00a0 And none were more powerful than Oracle Queen who was nearly a celestial in her own right\u2026.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span class=\"inline-attachment\">\n<dl class=\"fileimage display\">\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/202003/10758933_145ee9cfbeee098e8b8f2d36b5c81cb2_t.jpg\" />\n<dd class=\"file-comment\">Oracle Queen of Istus</dd> </dl>\n</span><br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>Title:\u00a0 Queen of the Colorless Fire \u2013 The Oracle of Istus</strong><br/>\nAKA: The Sojourn Ascendant, Celestial of Istus<br/>\nClasses: Rogue 3 / Cleric 35 / Monk 2<br/>\nRace: Human (or Half-elf)<br/>\nAlignment: Any Lawful<br/>\nXP Penalty: 0<br/>\nPlayable 1-40, PvM<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Attributes</span></strong><br/>\nStr10<br/>\nInt14<br/>\nWis18 (38)<br/>\nDex10<br/>\nCon12<br/>\nChr8<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>Domains:</strong> Travel &amp;

From Alignment and Spellcraft, while Fort, in addition to Spellcraft, is further bolstered by Endurance, Prot. From Alignment, Death Ward and Negative Energy Protection.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nThis is a very powerful caster cleric.\u00a0 The high AC provides a kind of natural resistance to criticals.\u00a0 While I posted base melee AB stats, one wouldn\u2019t be engaging in much melee other than with your normal riff-raff.\u00a0 You\u2019ll be sending your foes to meet their fates by using your dirtnap spells \u2013 Empowered Blades, Harms and Silent Harms, Implosions.\u00a0 You\u2019ll control the battlefield with Hammers and Words of Faith.\u00a0 And you\u2019ll be weakening your opponent from a ranged position with your ranged weapon.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nFrom a powergamer perspective -- and if you are not bound by Domain choices -- one could swap Knowledge with Trickery to make the Oracle truly unhittable.\u00a0 In such an instance, I would also recommend dropping Extend for Craft Wand to garner a poor man\u2019s HiPS with Wands of Invis/Improved Invis.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nThere\u2019s a few builds similar and only one build like this and it is <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build241732.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MorteMeister\u2019s Artful Dodger</a>:\u00a0 The title doesn\u2019t really do that build justice.\u00a0 This is more or less a retooling of that excellent build.\u00a0 This one retains all of that\u2019s build\u2019s goodness, but gets better Fort and Will saves, more hit points, Zen Archery, and Epic Skill Focus in Concentration.\u00a0 I also make some different skill choices to maximize the Rogue in this.\u00a0 Hopefully the Oracle is just different enough to merit inclusion in the guild.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nOthers tend to delay Monk and Rogue until the end.\u00a0 That\u2019s all fine and dandy, but I prefer to play my characters from the ground up so I\u2019ll try to scatter those classes throughout the build.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nAnother build similar is the\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build167438.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Divine Caster Crook</a><br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build154182.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Evasive All-Seeing Phae</a>:\u00a0<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/demolition-man-cleric-38-monk-1-rogue-1-t515420.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Maximilian\u2019s Demolition Man</a>:\u00a0 (another example of waiting until build\u2019s end to take a Rogue level)<br/>\nIn all of the above listed, they used the old trick of stacking UEF for high AC.\u00a0 That is no longer a thing (was fixed somewhere between 1.67-1.69).<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nFinally, may folks prefer to play their Clerics as warriors on steroids.\u00a0 There are very valid reasons for that.\u00a0 I tend to find in Epics that they lack a certain punching power when it comes to bosses and high-end mobs (we\u2019re talking solo now).\u00a0 With a pure and raw casting cleric, they have that punch in the Epics that one wants.\u00a0 They maintain a variety of ways of dealing with casters with low Fort saves, high end melee warriors with low reflex or will, and something for everyone in between.

If 1 DC/AC makes a functional difference over the long run it will be be balanced out by +4 Dodge and 50% Concealment being up ... all the time, I am sure.<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
