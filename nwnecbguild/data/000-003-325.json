      "content": "<div>May i ask a few things?<br/>\n<br/>\nAre you set on this lvl split, cause it is somewhat deficient. Better would be (Paladin 23/ WM 7/ CoT 10) OR (Paladin 15/ WM 7/ CoT 18) for example. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, do you want Devastating Critical into the build, because that would require additional feats that the build hardly can spare, but can be done if you truly want it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, are you set on Dwarves, because they have a deficiency as well with their lower CHA, better would be a Human, but once again it can be done if you truly want it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to capitalize. You want a Dwarven Paladin with WM lvls and great saves along with EDR 3, correct?</div>"

      "content": "<div>Yes that would be great.  Though I imagine it might not be possible.  I just wanted more CoT levels.  Paladin 15/ WM 7/ CoT 18 sounds good<br/>\nDevastating Critical has been disabled on my server.  So the important parts are dwarven using a long sword.  I choose long sword because<br/>\nThere is a paladin quest that gives a long sword.  I like Dwarven because on my server there is a nice dwarven sub race that gives good Spell<br/>\nresistance.

      "content": "<div>David,<br/>\n<br/>\nIn very high magic servers the best possible builds are those that have pure stats. Let me explain this, if you can find items and/or sub-races with tons of additional things on them, then having 10 rogue lvls to get improved evasion for example isn't necessary anymore, and if you can find weapons that have 8d12 additional elemental damage then epic weapon specialization becomes mediocre at best. What continues to be important though is pure things like AB. Weapon masters for example are thriving in these PW's, if possible DEX-based as well for additional defenses. Also STR-based toons in general start to have diminishing returns unlike the philosophy upon which we build here in general. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as sub-races go, you will have to tell us the adjustments for those you are particularly interested but obviously Trolls/Ogres and the like go well with Damage builds and the reverse is true as well. Try to keep away though from those that have INT penalties as these make difficult to take important feats like IKD/ Expertise and the like and also affect the number of skills you will have available.</div>"
