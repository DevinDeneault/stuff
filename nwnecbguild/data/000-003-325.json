What about a Dex Barbarian/SD/Monk build? One that has a high DC terrifying rage and with epic dodge? I looked and didn't see one, is there a reason for that? I think it would be a cool build, no? mostly for PvP, lvl 40. I don't care if its playable 1-40 just good at lvl 40. HiPS, high DC on rage....that would be cool. unarmed attack?   I can get +12 stats due to crafting items on the server I play on. Around 4 diff. +12 stats if need be. So cloth armor, I can bump up the AC with wisdom? Would also like to be able to hit things lol.Any ideas? As always, Thanks for your time and wisdom!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
