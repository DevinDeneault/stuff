      "content": "<div>A Barbarian with divine damage/defense, sneak attack and a hellspawn, and a Blackguard with an intimidating aura, trained as a Fighter.<br/>\n I like it!<br/>\n The build is ambitious. Putting many things into a build usually takes away focus and weakens it. But here you have managed to keep a good AB, and a fair AC. And there are ways to improve them within the build itself with Strength buffs, DS and an optional Expertise.<br/>\n The damage output is very good with high strength, EWS, SA, PA and DM.<br/>\n The effect of the divine feats depends on getting Charisma items. The effect of those feats improve with the square of the Cha modifier. 4 damage/hit x 4 rounds is not enough to make DM and DS worthwhile. But when you can bring Cha to 30 with items/eagle's pot, things look quite different with 10 damage/hit x10 rounds. High Cha also improves saves, smite and gives extra turning attempts.<br/>\n<br/>\n One thing I like about the Barbarian/Blackguard combo is that you can buff strength to the cap with the Blackguard's Bull's, a Bull's pot and Barbarian rage.</div>",

      "content": "<div><blockquote><div><strong>blastmaster wrote:</strong><hr/>You can't take IKD on 6th level. It requires +7 BAB.</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">Quite right, blastmaster. Good catch. <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/6.gif\"/>\u00a0 Swapping the Level 18 feat will work fine for pre-epic IKD.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, since you've forced me to take a closer look at this, one can recoup that 1 excess rank in Tumble to boost another skill (Listen?).\u00a0 Only unmodified ranks of Tumble matter for the AC boost.\n<blockquote><div><strong>Valerfor wrote:</strong><hr/>\n One word about the Blackguard's Sneak attack, do not use Darkness or anything like that, just Improved Knockdown and while they are on their butts they will be unable to resist taking on the extra damage.<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n Where are you playing, Valerfor?<br/>\n<br/>\n This statement makes absolutely no sense to me.\u00a0 In fact, unless the opponent is either a True Seer or is pre-buffed with Ultravision, every successful attack automatically registers as a sneak attack while the darkness is in effect with damage contingent on whether the target was sneak/crit immune or not.\u00a0 This is true for both melee and ranged attacks and is quite possibly the easiest exploit in the game since <em>Darkness</em> is never nerfed (not on any server or within any CC module I've played anyway), has no save and does not check SR.\u00a0 The only way for the designer to counter the exploit is to apply True Seeing to the majority of creature skins which is dammed cheesy IMO.</div></div>"
