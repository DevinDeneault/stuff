      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hi all ECB'ers,<br/>\n<br/>\nJust looking for advice on Druid builds. I thought it would be time I gave this class a serious try on a playthrough through Aielund (or other modules - if you suggest I will certainly give it a go!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to try to create a very good caster, which would pretty much mean very high Druid levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've read Monk is very important for shapeshifter builds and I dont want to compromise this so I have included 1 monk level after you get access to forms, also for a tumble and listen dump. I thought taking a couple more levels of Rogue for dumps of skills points, which the Druid seems to accumulate in abundance. Useful skills I wanted to get were Concentration, Heal, Tumble, Spellcraft, Listen, Spot, Persuade and Lore.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've read through a few of Maximillan Kane's posts when designing this, including <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/nature-s-strongest-defenders-a-guide-to-druids-t515540.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Guide to the Druid Class</a>. He also suggested getting 1 rank in Open Lock so that if you are shifted to an Air Elemental you can pick locks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also curious as to the Shapechange spell, which is a level 9 druid spell. It hasn't drawn a lot of attention or love as far as I can see. Max's guide to Druids seem to suggest the best shapes you play with are your wildshapes (ie Bear), then elementals (ie. Water Elemental), then skill Dragon Shape between level 30-36 to turn into a dragon. He seemed to imply here is a gap between level 20 and 30-36 where your forms are very weak until you get the Dragon Shape feat. Why not use the Shapechange spell, which allows a Red Dragon form (albeit not as strong) or a Golem form which allows tremendous immunities? Is it because their AB or AC is bad or something?<br/>\n<br/>\nI've avoided taking Zen Archery given I'm going to shapechange into other forms for hand to hand combat<br/>\n<br/>\nMax seems to think Conjuration is the best spell focus school so I have taken feats in that. I think that Max also mentioned it is best you 'tank' while your animal companion does damage - I took improved expertise at level 1 and Cons 14 to reflect this.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI also tried to get Dragon Shape as soon as possible (level 30).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy reflex save also seems to suck but I guess I'm not playing a Paladin or Blackguard build anymore so I have to get used to it :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, here is my build - I would love any comments on improvements before I start to play it in game :) I haven't played Druid before, just read a few guides which are out there. So I'm curious to hear what you think.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Edit (15/7/2019):</strong>\u00a0this is the most up to date build, for use on the WoG persistent world, updated the title of the post as well to avoid confusion.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDruid(36), Monk(1), Rogue(3), Human<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 8<br/>\nDEX: 10<br/>\nCON: 14<br/>\nWIS: 18 (34)<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Druid(1): Spell Focus: Conjuration, Greater Spell Focus: Conjuration<br/>\n02: Druid(2)<br/>\n03: Druid(3): Blind Fight<br/>\n04: Druid(4): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br/>\n05: Druid(5)<br/>\n06: Druid(6): Extend Spell<br/>\n07: Monk(1): {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}<br/>\n08: Druid(7): WIS+1, (WIS=20)<br/>\n09: Druid(8): Empower Spell<br/>\n10: Druid(9)<br/>\n11: Druid(10)<br/>\n12: Druid(11): WIS+1, Scribe Scroll, (WIS=21)<br/>\n13: Druid(12)<br/>\n14: Druid(13)<br/>\n15: Druid(14): Spell Focus: Necromancy<br/>\n16: Druid(15): WIS+1, (WIS=22)<br/>\n17: Druid(16)<br/>\n18: Druid(17): Greater Spell Focus: Necromancy<br/>\n19: Druid(18)<br/>\n20: Druid(19): WIS+1, (WIS=23)<br/>\n21: Druid(20): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=24)<br/>\n22: Druid(21)<br/>\n23: Druid(22)<br/>\n24: Druid(23): WIS+1, Great Wisdom II, (WIS=26)<br/>\n25: Druid(24): Great Wisdom III, (WIS=27)<br/>\n26: Druid(25)<br/>\n27: Druid(26): Great Wisdom IV, (WIS=28)<br/>\n28: Druid(27): WIS+1, (WIS=29)<br/>\n29: Druid(28): Great Wisdom V, (WIS=30)<br/>\n30: Druid(29): Dragon Shape<br/>\n31: Rogue(1)<br/>\n32: Druid(30): WIS+1, (WIS=31)<br/>\n33: Druid(31): Epic Spell Focus: Conjuration<br/>\n34: Druid(32): Epic Spell Focus: Necromancy<br/>\n35: Druid(33)<br/>\n36: Druid(34): WIS+1, Epic Reflexes, (WIS=32)<br/>\n37: Rogue(2)<br/>\n38: Druid(35)<br/>\n39: Rogue(3): Epic Prowess, {Uncanny Dodge I}<br/>\n40: Druid(36): WIS+1, Great Wisdom VI, (WIS=34)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 394<br/>\nSkillpoints: 313<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 25/35/22<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9, Fear: +2<br/>\nBAB: 24<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 24 (melee), 25 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 30/30<br/>\nSpell Casting: Druid(9)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nRed dragon form (no items before polymorph and no buffs) -

Apart from that, I think the best 8 feats for pre-epic are: sf: conjuration, gsf: conjuration, sf: necromancy, gsf: necromancy, extend spell, empower spell, blind-fight &amp; ic: unarmed strike. The last two can change depending on what do you want from your build, how many druid levels it has &amp; how melee-oriented you want to be but they are solid choice regardless. You do not need penetration feats with 37 druid levels unless you expect to do PvP or you know there are very high MR enemies on the module that you play on.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I really like the fact you take Dragon Shape at 30, Dragon Shape sounds like one of the strongest epic feats in the game. Level 30\u00a0seems to be the earliest possible time one can ever take it, and from what I can see from the CBC spreadsheet even if you take Champion of Torm (which I don't plan to) for the bonus Great Wisdom epic feats post level 21, you won't dragon shape faster, because even though you can get Wisdom 30 at Lvl 27 by taking Great Wisdom at that level, you will need one more feat to get the Dragon Shape.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your comments on the spell penetration feats. I agree they are unnecessary. I think there is a spell (Nature's Balance) which also reduces spell resistance by 7d4 at caster level 37 which should more than compensate if I ever need to deal with SR. Or I could just change into a dragon. I'll change them to SF/GSF necromancy then. Finger of death against those sneaky rogue type enemies sounds pretty good!<br/>\n<br/>\nJust curious, Heavy Armor proficiency feat for druids? +3AC from full plate when you shape change? Armor Skin sounds better to be honest<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm feeling close to ready to go .. I'll sit and wait for a day or two to see if there are any other comments<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Dragon Shape at level 28 with four of CoT :)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I went D34 / M2 / CoT 4, it wouldn't excessively weaken the DC for spells or the ability to penetrate SR? Is this the amazing power of Owl's Insight? Mick was stating with his evil spell caster Sorc 35/M3/BG2 he noted there was some impact with the spell casting from taking those 5 levels away from Sorc, but Sorc doesnt have that super powerful +12 Wisdom spell...<br/>\n<br/>\nMinor edit: I've taken the plunge and been very much rewarded. Got to level 3. Levels 1 and 2 were super easy with Nelise and Dante. I would turn on Improved Expertise, which with a mundane Scimitar, Breastplate and Shield would lead me to having 26 AC. I'd let my summoned bear do the damage. Now I've learned I can't cast any spells however with metal armor as a druid in Aielund... so I'm selling that breastplate and getting some studded leather...<br/>\n<br/>\nFurther update: Pretty much finished Act 1 - I'm near the end. Level 7 (D6/M1) right now, nearly level 8. Druid is really easy to play, I thought it would be harder. I took my planned single level in Monk and am running around with AC 27 with a Kama +2, robes +3 and Monk boots +3, 10 tumble (+2 tumble AC) and 10 listen when I'm fully buffed with Bull's Strength/Cats Grace/Endurance/Owls Wisdom (from an item)/Barkskin. Call lightning is just sweet, especially when I can just walk up to mobs with Improved Expertise active (AC 37) and cast like 2-3 call lightnings at the start of battle, then turning into a bear to finish the rest of the fight. I'm playing total tank mode, running in and drawing the aggressing whilst my Panther, summon creature III and other companion focus on dealing the damage.\u00a0I can even fight reasonably with my single level in Monk in human form\u00a0with all the buffs\u00a0with the Kama +2 if I want to save my spells and shape changes. The Wolf form seems to have a bit more AC than the bear form, but the attack bonus from the bear form is just so good. Knockdown would have been really good combined with the bear form but I can see I'm pretty feat starved so I ended up taking extend spell for now. Maybe I will invest in knockdown but I will obviously lose some spell casting feats pre-epic which I might suffer from. All in all, Druid is a really nice class to play and I'm glad I took the plunge, much easier than I expected<br/>\n<br/>\nFurther update 2: Rather than just adding to the thread I thought I would just edit this post to give you a further update, just in case you wanted to know. Halfway through Act 2 now. Hardcore DnD rules of course (not yet brave enough to take the plunge to 'Very difficult' - not sure why I would want to put myself at an unfair disadvantage though!). The game is super cruisy right now. I'm running around with about 30 - 40 AC plus stoneskin, depending on whether I'm using Improved Expertise. Got to level 11 by clearing out a huge mob of orcs in one of the quests. Trying to minimise spoilers here, but there is a particular choke point where like 20-30 orcs are fighting you, and because its outdoors, I stand there with 40 AC (improved Expertise Active, +7 AC from Monk Wisdom - I had 24 wis) whilst the enemy are trying to hit me with a game of 20s, cast two empowered call lightnings and four standard call lightnings and they all got obliterated, and I pretty much gain an entire level by doing this. I get the feeling I could play the game without wild shape but its such a good ability at this stage of the game to clean up house once you have used all your spells. It is super cool to be a big bad monk bear with 32 strength, and doing four attacks with flurry (I'm sure its going to get better) and being able to use stunning fist once a day with super high wisdom. Dispel magic from some of the spellcasters was a nuisance (stripped half my buffs) is a nuisance but bear wildshape was more than enough to deal with that dude. People say clerics are overpowered, but druids are probably just as strong, just the crazy AB buffs are not nearly as numerous but you get other skills like shapechange to compensate.<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way I am super glad I took that single level of Monk at 7 - it just made everything much easier... 10 tumble (+2AC) and 10 listen the icing on the cake as well.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Just an update. I thought I would post I found a possible answer to my own questions.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>RE Shapechange spell and Heavy Armor Proficiency feat ?useful for druid characters.</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nWhen polymorphed via feats such as wildshape and elemental form, only the magical properties of the helm, armor and shield slot are transferred. The base AC from items is not transferred. So you could wear mundane clothing or mundane full platemail plus mundane tower shield and the AC the polymorph gains is the same (zero). If you have an +5AC shield and +5AC armor this mean +5 AC polymorph AC as only the highest AC value is transferred. Whereas if you had that same +5AC Shield and Robes of the Old Order (damage reduction +1 soak 5 damage), you would have +5AC as a polymorph, plus the damage reduction. Therefore heavy armor proficiency provides no value to the polymorphed druid, unless one wishes to obtain the magical properties from a particular piece of heavy armor, and in that particular situation, there are probably better feats to take anyway which Valefor has outlined in detail.\u00a0 Amulets, rings, belts, gloves and cloaks magical properties do not transfer to polymorphs. Bonus spells from additional wisdom (or Int/Cha if you are a wizard/sorcerer) from these items are lost when polymorphing so cast them as buffs before you do polymorph.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen polymophed via spells, such as Shapechange as far as I can see there is no such transfer of such magical properties from the helm, armor or shield at all or any items. Even though you are a big bad red dragon if you have powerful magical properties on helm, armor and/or shield slots it could be more advantageous to still transform into an elemental or greater elemental than use shapechange to turn into a dragon. I haven't got to level 17 Druid, which is when you get access to Lvl 9 spells to test it out in a practical sense in game. I can update this post once I get a chance to.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I thought I would share what I learned by playing the druid class, reading the Wiki (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Polymorph\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Polymorph</a>) and testing it in game with the PGCC Module v4.3 (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/module/pretty-good-character-creator-customizer-pgc3-powered-igipe\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://neverwintervault.org/project/nw ... ered-igipe</a>).

There are 5-foot steps (a pain in the butt of any DM), difficult terrain rules, reactions &amp; maneuvers like trip\u00a0(knockdown), faint, disarm, bull-rush, overrun &amp; sunder. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen there is \"reach\", which was never detailed before &amp; previously all monsters assumed to be engaged with the PCs in arbitrary distances but here a Titan wielding a polearm could have 30-feet reach &amp; with combat reflexes feat could take attacks of opportunity against anyone engaging him long before they reach him. About the only thing simplified from previous editions was Initiative which is a downgrade from 2nd editions masterpiece but better by a longshot from 1st-editions convoluted system.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would be happy to teach you some PnP but I'm afraid you are a long way from Athens, Empyre.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'd like to improve the saves by taking Lightning Reflexes/ Epic Reflexes / Epic Fortitude feats which synergises well with Evasion which means I would ditch Expertise/Imp Expertise/Knockdown and not take Improved Critical: Unarmed. I hope not taking IC: Unarmed doesnt excessively weaken the build. I definitely want to include both SF/GSF/ESF Conjuration and Necromancy that is super good<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso does Epic Prowess work for creature weapons (ie polymorphed druids)?
