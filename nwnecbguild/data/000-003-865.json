      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">I've been needing to get back to hitting things hard after recent excursions into variations of subtlety. Nothing fancy, just a strong melee presence who cheers herself up with a little song while she chops things in half.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a combo I've seen before, but always much heavier on Bard, and I also like the thought of a slender, graceful elf unleashing some inner demons on an unsuspecting world. It also means I get free longsword proficiency from the start, so don't need to worry about a WF before going to CoT. One very viable tweak would be to drop Toughness, jiggle a few feats around, and take another WF in a 2-hander as well, for added oomph (which I know Valerfor would approve of). Yes, I know I could have both with a human build, but where's the fun in that? I also decided to grab all 7 Great Strengths just for kicks, so saved some CoT bonus feats so I could take 5 in epic levels - I still think it works though, if not entirely optimized.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour thoughts are, as ever, appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn light of the post title, let's call her...<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Blanche Neige</strong><br/>\nBard 8/ RDD 10/ CoT 22<br/>\nAny non-evil, non-lawful.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">That means a lot to me, thanks, Valerfor!<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, should anyone wish to go for the 2-handed WF option, take it at level 12, shifting IKD to 18 to replace Toughness. Also, obvs, make your crits and EWF in the 2-hander. You'll lose 3 AC from the loss of tower shield, but you've always got the option to grab that longsword again to go S+B. You'll also lose 40 HPs, but that shouldn't really matter. You'll be gaining 1.5 damage, so enemies shouldn't last long enough to let get you that low.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly enough, looking at Blanche's current classes, she started as a Barbarian/ Ranger/ HS. I just couldn't make it work properly. She'd have made a decent tank, but not a front-line hitter.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It was mulling over your Ranger/ WM/ SD thread that started it. Then you'd mentioned something about Bard/ AA/ Barbarian in a thread that I started. That started my thinking about a Barb and Ranger mix-up with a Tumble class thrown in. From there I went to Barb/ Bard/ RDD, but there are thousands of them out there. Then someone asked about Panthro (Valerfor's Half-Orc Bard/ Fighter/ RDD). Then I remembered my first ever build request, for which Empyre provided an elf Bard/ Fighter/ RDD, with tweaks from Valerfor. And finally I thought I'd try something myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeird how the brain works, ain't it?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

My installation is still buggered I'm afraid - else I wouldn't have poor Mirnaia belting around with another of my putative builds (whatever others might say, I'm not <strong>that</strong> big a swine).
