Wave bye-bye to your foe (Robin is a seasoned Knight, after all)], while theme-wise being a cross between Quarterstaff and Mace; this, as a \u201ccompromise\u201d so far as the mace was also a side arm of medieval warriors (standard issue for bashing (bludgeon) enemies pre-plate, and to wrap around shields) but at the same time incorporating the staff legends of Robin Hood so far as the tales are quite clear that, during a show down with Little John on a bridge, Robin was bested by the latter, who beat him off the bridge with a stick (aka quarter staff, but which NWN is not a double-sided but, rather, a large weapon, contrary to the description). <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>**Alternative Path\u2014Dev.Crit: Don\u2019t want double weapon spec, prefer Dev.Crit instead?</strong><br/>\nIf so and/or not interested in theme, then feel free to drop second weapon (in which case, select kurki as main and in this case only weapon (wonderful range i.e. 13-20/x3 / Keen: 10-20/x3), forcing those crits and chewing through foes like there's no tomorrow, while enabling sword+board/AC when desired as well). Take Power Attack and Cleave at Lev 6 (instead of WF/WS 2nd weapon), Grt.Cleave at Lvl 20 (instead of IC: 2nd weapon), picking up OC: kukri at lvl 34 (instead of WoC: 2nd weapon), DC: kukri at lvl 37 (instead of Epic Toughness, -20HPs or 480 adj); additionally, instead of EWF/EWS 2nd weapon at levels 21 and 33, grab EITHER Epic Fort along with Grt.Fort (+6 Fort, or Fort: 28 adj; recommended if looking to PvP your Robin in dev.crit arena) \u2013OR- 2 more Grt.STR (STR 34 adj., i.e. +1AB/Dam., or: Naked AB 50, and +1 DC on Dev.Crit, or: DC: 42 / 48 bio-cap) et voila: dev.crit instead. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor those fans who prefer their Robin Hood not as a true-to-life knight but, rather, as a legendary archer (as he was portrayed in subsequent legends), see: Robin of Locksley, Wildwood Outlaw: (placeholder).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd now back to our regularly scheduled program\u2026<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>III.

      "content": "<div>Streetfighter, eh? (Robbin' the Hood is kind of pushing it, ain't it? Lest this be a take on Men-in-Tights to go along with the Prince of Thieves, I suppose   ). Streetfighter with rogue works, though! <br/>\n<br/>\nNice take, Mick. Glad to see all the inspiration my build inspired, truly (then, suppose Robin Hood has that effect on us all, with ECBers having their own take as to what that \"inspiration\" means    ).<br/>\n<br/>\nAh, but doesn't achieve what it is that ranger gives as said. Hare are the comparisons.<br/>\n<br/>\nLoss of 2 strength, unlike Robin (thanks to free dual without more, no need of useless DEX) which Strength on account of those dual wield requirements the Streetfighter will never be able back; this in turn means Streetfighter will NEVER be able to achieve a Dev.Crit DC 42 (which is excellent, being the very best one can possibly achieve without RDD in the mix, not everyone wanting to play RDD and in many places they're banned). Then, I do aim for level 40 excellence, if I ever may say so humbly.   <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the double weapon path instead, as you see, by trying to grab more strength (which I appreciate) means you in reality dumped the second weapon focus. Robin enjoys not only WF/EWF and WoC on both weapons, but also IC, WS and EWS on both as well. This, being something Streetfighter cannot possibly do without gutting strength, on account once again of those dual wield DEX requirements and lack of WM's boni feat selection as said (which feats fighter and Cot get, 2 more feats coming in on ranger, which dual req't ranger bypass as well, thus 3 more feats and more STR etc in turn; it's how it is that I achieved what it is that I did, no other class being excused from those requirements. and requiring also 3 feats also just to pick up dual wield as well and by definition means NEVER being able to accomplish that which it is Ranger does in turn   <br/>\n<br/>\nMeantime, if playing in an arena where dev.crit is banned, I'm going with scimitar (more base damage than kukri yet sharing that same exact wonderful threat range, i.e., 10-20/x3 keen (that extra damage tripling on a crit as well), enabling use of the big board and of course plate as well, only it don't go flying out of your hands in the game of disarm as would a kukri --which be tiny weaponry (if dev.crit is banned, no point in going with that; ah, but if dev.crit isn't, then, heh, 6 apr (7 apr hasted) as against a Naked DC 42? Can't no more strike back or disarm if foe is dead, and as against a Naked DC 42 ... LOL. Otherwise, forget about it. Go scim and grab Two-Bladed Sword (large, double-bladed weapon just like dire mace, same exact damage except it's slashing instead of bludgeon thus enjoying that great dual wield, etc., only with a much better crit threat factor (same as enjoys bastard sword and great sword). Ability to deliver two different damage types being super nice PvM/E but not matter in PvP, where you'll prefer the crit factor instead and being a large weapon no disarm woes either, making quick work of your foe instead. Thing is, need WS/EWS/IC and not just WF/EWF on both like Robin does to enjoy all that!   Giving up very important things, and thus needing to drop yet even more strength for that (and no, PA don't make up for that--trading \"to hit\" is something epic weapon masters pull in order to have damage to deliver, but can't deliver if don't hit, and what's the point of taking WM if going to do that; with Ranger, high str, dual wield, etc. and either dev.crit -or- double weapon focus so as zero need for that (PA is redundant when have damage; if you drop strength so as to fit everything in, then take PA up front and center so as to make up for it a bit at least, even though it means giving up your AB in turn. Should be fine for PvM/E, what a lot of WMs do--i.e., just so darn reliant on the crits in order to do damage, just don't work so good (as in not at all) when up against crit/sneak immunes. I personally hate that, like all my AB and damage in tact, going for double weaponry focus, fully spec'd, combine with high STR, dual wield and WS/EWS, heh, shore up the WM's weakness' yet same time enjoying all of its benefits, yes? Whole point. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen, those darn dual wield DEX requirements getting in the way of a non-ranger, eh? (meaning, once again, not comparable as don't achieve what it is 9 ranger does in turn, just don't, there being no other way to bypass those requirements among other things as said). <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, loss of HPs. Less than 500! I appreciate Streetfighter has more than 400 (which is the melee minimum), but that's the floor not the ceiling. REAL melee warriors want more. Why? Because melee warriors stand out in the front lines, front and center, high AB/damage ensures the dead don't strike back, with HPs to take a beating should things go wrong. Remember also that sneaky dex' rogues pull first punch, and how also it was in the old days we used to discuss melee by among other things how many IGMS (Max) missiles a melee could take?   <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, could cut AS for ET, but that would still be less than 500 as enjoyed by Robin, and zero benefit over light armor in turn (which as I set out on the thread, just isn't an issue; and which, even if do that, still don't get to 500 (and also meaning a loss of yet another feat right there). <br/>\n<br/>\nTraps? Those are nice, great idea!  Give up the ranger's entitlement to items, scrolls, but pick up UMD to replace that, only you give up an important part of your scouting skills in order to do it--namely, dropped spot (there be synergies b/w listen and spot as said, the former speaks to M/S whereas the latter speaks to hide, not just for PvP but monsters can also be sneaky in PvM/E as well, we are not after all an AA archer--no imbue arrow explosions, etc. on hearing something or watching a sneaky rogue disappear; UMD is nice but not really that effective on a non-caster/melee build. We are a melee, not a caster after all, and  UMD buffs are readily dispelled by just about everything out there (dispelling comes in scroll form as well.  Used to be I trained up UMD on melee, so as to get around the restrictions; this, due to the inherent limitations of melee builds--namely, if can't get to something to hit it, you can't damage it. Without UMD or traps, kinda screwed. Not so when have traps (which are better than UMD, far more \"versatile\" (as in deadly) than trying to toss a UMD fireball off or something as a melee, not being a caster. Everything else: well, that is what KD is for (nothing can harm you when on their backs, and what it is that melee do!!).  <br/>\n<br/>\nStill it's nice to play with magic, which ranger spells all of them coming in scroll form provides and on its own (true of paladin class, too). Just saying. And if in an environs where UMD/Scrolls like GMW etc. are plentiful, then you will find a +5 weapon as well as keen weaponry, too (weaponry enhancements don't stack; but IC, WM ki crit and keen weaponry all do!). Yes, UMD is nice for shoring up i.e. that oh so typical weakness of melee--namely, will save. But clarity comes in the form of a potion as well, in all magic level environs, being one of if not the easiest thing to shore up on the NWN planet, so with traps (assuming paladin or ranger entitlements) don't need no UMD in turn. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'd tell you to cut (useless) DEX and throw those ability points into STR instead ... oh, but right not being a ranger, in order to enjoy the benefits of dual wield (and you've only one weapon focus really, not two, and never getting to a Dev.Crit DC 42 without such STR either) the Streetfighter can't, cuz s/he's not a ranger but a rogue!!!       <br/>\n<br/>\n(Psst. Closest you can possibly get is with a CoT/WM/Fighter mix, same issue in terms of 2 Str down from the get go and always no matter what cf. ranger (on account of that dual DEX requirements), and loss of a feat as well (drop AS), only problem is: no traps -or- magic entitlement of any nature, type, or kind whatsoever, hence back to the age old problem of melee--i.e., if can't hit ...   . Playing around with that combo in revising a different character I did over at the ECB/NWN2 (dang nab it. Wish we had 4 classes to play with like NWN2, but we don't. We'll see in turn). Like I said, Ranger is best ...   <br/>\n<br/>\nGave it a really good college try, though. (Appreciate same, Mick. I do; and must say, what a really nice \"twist\" on the WM/FTR/Rogue combo if I do say so myself -- robbin' the Hood, indeed!   ..  ).<br/>\n<br/>\nTyr</div>"

Low caster levels can be dispelled, that is true, but if that is your only concern, you miss out on a lot. Not all opponents have the ability to dispell! Weapon buffs will not be dispelled. And you get access to Dispell, Breach and Mord yourself! You also have a  list of utility spells like Knock, Find traps, True seeing, etc that to some extent can replace skills like Open lock, Search, Disarm traps, Spot, Listen and so on. And spells can give you immunities, better AC, AB and damage etc, but you all know that already.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a good feeling about my build   <br/>\n<br/>\nMick</div>",

      "content": "<div>Mick, <br/>\nFirstly, bastard sword and dire mace are \"theme\" weapons on Robin. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor PvM/E, swap to kukri to chew if like and whip out dire for the big boss (and sneak/crit immunes like undeads), pounding through. Fact remains: Streetfighter spec's up one weapon (just the kukri), not the dire mace (lacks WS/EWS and IC on that), whereas Robin thoroughly enjoys it all on not just one but two. Streetfigher gutted everything for STR, so that is kinda cheating (If Robin spec'd only one weapon, AB 50, STR 34, Dev.Crit 42, being something Streetfighter simply will never be able to do, and hardly \"boast\" a double weapon focus when he has only actually spec'd one, eh? Unlike Robin who does in fact enjoy two.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and gear? Well, everything gets the exact same thing, too. (I know you know this). And as to UMD? That don't make up for the lack of feats, nor lack of damage either. Firstly, dire mace cannot be keened; but even if it could (and can't), in a world where all these lovely scrolls Streetfighter intends to beg and borrow for, magic weaponry including built-in keen item property -AND- elemental damage enhancements thereon are available, too. So don't need no UMD scrolls (for what? Casting a fire ball? Won't beat SR much less get around the saves issues; speaking of which, if want to take advantage of \"evasion\", then either take a saves boost feat or raise your dex!).<br/>\n<br/>\nBTW, with a REAL double weapon focus (let's give Robin kukri and dire mace for PvM'E), means on top of full spec as is (which Streetfighter don't have), gets not only magic weaponry with the keen prop built in (a keen scroll would add nothing more, don't stack with the item prop anymore than magic enhancements like GMW, etc. do either), but also 3 different elemental damage enhancements, namely: fire, cold and acid..All covered!! (Beauty of not only a double weapon focus, but also dual wielding, too, yes?!!?).<br/>\n<br/>\nMeantime, Streetfighter don't own any such scrolls, not a single one. Acting as if he has a spellbook or something, which he don't.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a mere wish list. Don't exist in low magic (at best, find a +3 enhancement like blade thirst (ranger scroll) and aid (also a ranger scroll), not that either need such things \"to hit\" (not with this AB they don't); thing is though, if drop strength to actually spec up both weapons (which Robin has and enjoys), Street fighter kinda loses some AB there, eh? (Should be fine in low magic, though; still, real hard naked AB/damage like Robin has whether with the dev.crit path OR fully spec'd double weapon path is best   . Mid-magic there's gear as said, but whatever you get, everyone else of course gets, too. Meantime, and thing is, higher the magic setting, more things you find that dispel as well (there being a world with monster/dragons that do enjoy the power of mord's, yes, monsters with Mord's! And over on WoG lots of things dispel, too, so UMD buffs don't mean much in turn. In PvP? Forget about it. Everything and their PET dispels. Either sufficient caster level to avoid that, or you don't, and Streetfighter don't). <br/>\n<br/>\nFind a +3 weapon enhancement (blade thirst) in low magic at best, which IMO is a ranger scroll, same with Aid. If you want more, play a caster so as to have a spellbook instead. Much rather have all my AB/damage (WF/EWF, WoC, IC, WS/EWS -and- high STR) on both weapons, and higher HPs as well. And no, the difference in HPs is not negligible either; without the same damage set-up, ...<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, you really think a point or 2 of AC is going to make any difference at all? Seriously? It don't. All that dodge, tumble, etc. goes right out the window when attacked out of stealth (all those so-called UMD buffs Street fighter hopes to get but which don't own, dispelled). Not just in PvP either, as PvM/E monsters can be stealthy, and many dispel (dragons with Mord's!!!), too. Scout skills full trained, synergies you know (oh, and ultravision + purge invis? They be ranger's, too.   <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, yes, it's fun to toss fire balls and play with wands, and when I want to do that I play a caster (thing called beating SR, etc. which with UMD Streetfighter can't do, not to mention all those saving throws that enemies get, and which as against Streetfighter they'll beat every time, unless praying for an auto fail d1; heh, about as useless as a pet, but the pet is at least cute, oh yes it is!   ). <br/>\n<br/>\nRobin is a pure H&amp;S melee build, not a caster, and news flash: Streetfigher ain't either. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlay tip: with rights and entitlements to ranger items and scrolls, that be plenty magic enough (ranger's book is designed for melee, super nice with the traps). Stacking grease works good, lay it on high and pile it on thick (stacks with itself as said, enemies fall down, as they do when you KD them. Be it large, double-bladed weapon or otherwise, with 6 apr (7 apr haste item, and yes, fully spec'd weapons), they are dead. In terms of \"hordes\", traps thin 'em out good. Soften em up fine, and you finish em. Or, enjoy the DEV CRIT DC 42 dual wield and ... well, you know already. (Far better than trying to sling from a scroll as if a caster when not a caster, no hope in Hel to beat SR much less saves and if want to boast about evasion, for god's sake, man, RAISE YOUR DEX!!!). Whole Point of a WM is to CRIT ... (works best with high strength, WS/EWS and IC on both weapons, like Robin has.   ).<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I think I'd like Street fighter more if he actually went DEX. At least the STR needed for the PA (which you'll want to take up front and in the beginning) wouldn't be wasted ... have a nice AC, go dual wield short swords (street knives. slashing) and mace (street club, bludgeon) maybe. Make up for the lack of STR Streetfigher would have if he genuinely actually fyll spec'd both weapons. (See? Robin takes from the rich, gives to poor street fighers lacking HPs, IC, WS/EWS and the ability to EVER (as in NEVER) achieve a Dev.Crit DC 42 either , eh?...     <br/>\n<br/>\nTyr<br/>\n<br/>\nPS Good sparring with you, Mick (thanks!).</div>"
