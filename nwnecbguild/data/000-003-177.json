Cleric 18/Monk 3 will give a bit more slots, spell penetration and resistance to dispelling, BAB 14.\u00a0 Cleric 17/Monk 4 will increase BAB by 1 settling on 15.\u00a0 Beyond that...<br/>\n<br/>\n What you need to decide is a few things first:<br/>\n<br/>\n 1) How often would you like to take advantage of the Tumble dump and the extra monk skill points?\u00a0 4 times max is possible.\u00a0 Each dump would add +1 AC that stacks with all other sources.<br/>\n 2) What weapon are you planning to use and will it take advantage of the monk progression?\u00a0 That means unarmed or kama.\u00a0 Any other weapon uses the -5 BAB progression.<br/>\n 3) Only a robed (or naked) monk w/o shield will benefit from the WIS AC, the monk AC and the monk speed.\u00a0 It also means pumping DEX rather than STR makes more sense. Is this what you were planning?<br/>\n 4) By \"utilizing\" those two spells do you merely mean \"accessing\" them via Cleric 17+ or \"focusing\" on them via Spell Focus: Evocation and Spell Focus: Necromancy?<br/>\n 5) Your base skill set should include Discipline, Spellcraft and Tumble.\u00a0 Perhaps Concentration is also a good idea to help mimimize spell interruption while being flanked or targeted by archers.<br/>\n Your skill requirements will determine the INT level needed to achieve that set.\u00a0 Any other skills you were planning on accessing/needing?<br/>\n<br/>\n Answering these questions and those from the Request template (above) should define your request well enough to recommend a productive build strategy.</div></div>"

No plagiarizing for me! *boo*\u00a0 The problem with going one-handed is that all the monk bonuses are neutralized with a shield.\u00a0 Between the monk AC, DEX AC and WIS AC this toon will have way more AC than any hvy plate/tower combo, especially after ability buffs.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n It's a HiPS-er like his (since you didn't indicate any HiPS nerf in your request), therefore no XP penalty to concern with.\u00a0 But there is one feat choice to make that, TBH, I don't have the time to analyze statistically to determine what is theoretically better.\u00a0 An ED mnk/clc could be made with rogue, but not without XP penalty along the way.<br/>\n<br/>\n Overview is:<br/>\n Cleric(23), Monk(12), Shadowdancer(5), Lawful Human (Pre-epic mnk8/clc12)<br/>\n<br/>\n STR 10, DEX 16(26), CON 12, WIS 16(20), INT 12, CHA 8<br/>\n Pre-epic: all bumps to DEX, Epic: WIS, DEX x3, WIS<br/>\n<br/>\n Feats: Pre-epic - Ambidexterity, Blind Fight, Finesse, WF, TWF, Dodge, IC (or ITWF, that's the decision), Mobility\u00a0 (note: neither finesse nor wf can be taken until level 2 with 3/4 BAB classes)<br/>\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Epic: Grt WIS, Grt DEX x2, Grt WIS, Epic Dodge (Lvl 33), EWF, Prowess, Armor Skin<br/>\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [Zen archery would be redundant in this build]<br/>\n<br/>\n Domains:\u00a0 Really doesn't matter that much but be sure to include one domain that provides Cat's Grace.\u00a0 <em>Strength</em> is a handy domain to open up more DP slots.<br/>\n<br/>\n Skills: Discipline 43(43), Hide 43(51), Move Silently 43(51), Spellcraft 42(43), Tumble 40(48) ---&gt; 11 left over<br/>\n<br/>\n Using the Level 5 spell, a Clc 23 can reach SR 35 so why go to Mnk 12?\u00a0 Because the monk SR 22 cannot be breached or dispelled.\u00a0 Look at it as an insurance policy.<br/>\n Decide which has more value at Level 15, Improved critical or ITWF.\u00a0 ITWF is probably better vs crit immunes like undead but ImpCrit better vs all other races.\u00a0 Your insane monk APR will make the benefit of an add'l APR even less proportionately for monk progression and, incidentally, the extra attack from ITWF is at -5 BAB, not -3 (which is why I value it so little with a dual-kama monk).\u00a0 With flurried attacks you will miss ITWF even less.<br/>\n<br/>\n Other benefits of Clc 23 is near-immunity to dispels (Clc 24 is immune all dispels except Mords) and good penetration without needing extra feats.\u00a0 Empowered abilities would have been very handy but unfortunately, metaspelling is not possible in this build, not without sacrificing AB/AC and using epic feats to do it.\u00a0 You shouldn't be needing Extended spells with this many clc levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n Native AB develops more slowly here than typical builds to get ED ASAP.\u00a0 However, Cleric buffs will more than compensate for the temporary lack.<br/>\n<br/>\n HiPS not available until epic.\u00a0 Could swap out 4 levels of pre-epic Monk for 4 of SD but IMO monk 6 is more useful than HiPS in pre-epic, especially until the stealth skills become elevated a bit more and monk levels have discipline dumps.<br/>\n<br/>\n Skill-wise, the ability spread only warrants what I've listed.\u00a0 To max Concentration as well, either one of the current skills will need to be sacrificed (not recommended) or the abilities split up to get to INT 14 (also not recommended because it slows progress even further).<br/>\n<br/>\n If not an ED build, then consider a mnk/clc/CoT which will open more feats and the sweet CoT Great WIS bonus feats.\u00a0 In either case, a robed monk cleric will get more value from a Dex build than one focused on STR.</div>"

Start with a few monk levels to qualify for WF &amp; Finesse then alternate with cleric however seems most beneficial to you.\u00a0 Max always liked to go straight cleric but I prefer to gradually access the monk feats at regular intervals.\u00a0 Either way works fine. Fill in the feats the way it makes most sense to you. Like I said, I postponed HiPS until epic (which just happens to be Level 21) and the rest basically just cleric levels peppered with regular monk and SD tumble dumps.\u00a0 There are enough boosts to WIS either by ability bump or by feat to assure that each new spell level will have adequate ability level to cast spells.\u00a0 If you notice the final Discipline level (43) you can immediately infer, w/STR 10, that the build ends on a monk level, since Disc is only a class skill for monk.<br/>\n<br/>\n I am not being intentionally evasive but do have a method to my madness.</div></div>"
