The CBC (Kamiryn's Character Build Calcuater, get it at\u00a0(link is external)) to create sophisticated and sometimes very complicated builds where getting every level right is essential to the build. Users will upload text versions (output from CBC) to the forum where the builds are tested and critiqued. With this tool, it is now trivial to scrutinize builds in the CBC without the tedious process of manually having to\u00a0enter hundreds of skill points, feats etc.\n</details>\n<strong>How it works:</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>Download and extract autocbc.zip .</li>\n<li>In the extracted folder should be:<br/>\nautocbc.exe<br/>\nCBC.xlsx<br/>\ninput<br/>\noutput<br/>\n\u00a0</li>\n<li>Place builds in the input folder. For examples of properly and almost properly formatted builds, download the example_input.zip. All input files should end with \".txt\"</li>\n<li>Run autocbc.exe. You will see a console window pop up telling you what is going on. When the program is done, it will say \"press any key to continue...\"\u00a0</li>\n<li>Created files are in the output folder.

      "content": "<div>@Valerfor Thank you very much. Actually, this thing is meant as a piece of a (hopefully) bigger puzzle. What I really want to do atm is generate custom class packages (you know, those useless things you select on character creation) from ECB builds for super easy and safe leveling with the \"Recommended\" button. The best way to ensure a builds integrity other than actually playing it is\u00a0afaik the CBC. Maybe even a scary 'Fully Automatic Leveler' could be made\u00a0with GUI automation <span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83d\ude2c</span>\u00a0(who would dare use such a thing, haha!). Then there is also scraping forums for builds to help with the archive.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm working on the internal build parser right now - I want it to parse damn near everything that smells like an NWN build, not just CBC output, that would not be very interesting. You're actually mentioned in my notes, there's the \"CBC standard\" and the \"Valerfor standard\" lol. Stag's build format is also a challenge - how the hell do you parse \"Disc1,...\"???. Getting the parser right could be a building block for some very interesting projects. The current version (0.1 alpha) is mostly a proof of concept.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd sick that you can make builds without the CBC - my head would explode!</div>"

As with Valerfor, I don't use the CBC, but that's probably as much about masochism as anything. I still quite like the pencils and paper set out before me and seeing what comes from them. That and I've never had much time for or interest in IT - much as I feel about plumbing or the internal combustion engine. Sorry about the Disc1 stuff and so on, I type everything in here direct, and typing \"Discipline\" 40 times is exceptionally boring for someone whose keyboard skills extend to 2 fingers on a good day.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, your efforts are massively appreciated. Part of my witterings elsewhere were at least partially driven by thinking about Hip's filter and how to keep it updated without necessarily re-inventing it. I know I don't have the skills, but wondered if between your good self and Orion we might be able to harness the ability and enthusiasm. Perhaps honesty is not always the best policy, but we're all (well, mostly) stout hearts who feel a love for the game here, and if we can't trust fellow members with our thoughts, who can we trust?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it's the sort of thing you might be interested in, please let me know.

Besides, if everybody just posted CBC output writing a parser would be trivial - almost not worth doing, and not very fun. So thank you (and others) for making this particular project very challenging. Hey, at worst we can have a completely automated CBC-archive of Maximillian and Mick Dagger builds (which is not so bad when I think about it.)\n<blockquote><div>Part of my witterings elsewhere were at least partially driven by thinking about Hip's filter and how to keep it updated without necessarily re-inventing it. <br/>\n(...)\u00a0If it's the sort of thing you might be interested in, please let me know.\u00a0</div></blockquote>\nJust let me know what you want done and how and I'll look into it.

      "content": "<div>Thanks DPA! I think what we could do with is an updating of Hip's filter every year or two (to a certain extent it will depend on hos many builds are added - at all levels). All would need to conform to Kail's rules, of course. Hip was (probably still is) a very good person, who added anything that might have been missing and corrected any slips. Mick and Empyre may wish to take a similar line, but I'm getting butch here (as far as I can), and suggesting only those builds that have been fully tested etc should be included. Or they'll get moved to the Unfinalized Builds forum. The Stag has spoken.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have no idea at all how this may be accomplished, and that's where you come in - and I really don't want to abuse your time (oh, all right, I do, but work-shmurk). Maybe we could pursue through PMs?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and what would you prefer: Hero Finder? Priest of the Ascendants? Bloke who Finds Stuff Out? Eric? All manner of things are do-able here...</div>",

      "content": "<div><blockquote><div>(...)I'm getting butch here (as far as I can), and suggesting only those builds that have been fully tested etc should be included.</div></blockquote>\nIn that case, that could be only a handful of builds, right? That sounds more like detective work. If we're talking 20 - 40 builds that need to be added, some low-tier administration could be applied to avoid duplicated efforts but not much more. Sounds like mostly a busy day/afternoon if one knows what to add.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Idea:</strong>\u00a0Maybe the builds to include could come from a community effort, sort of like the \"Hall of Fame\" thread that never really amounted to anything? But with strict rules for posting submissions and voting. Then we avoid Batman'ing every thread individually to see what builds have been tested; just make a stickied thread and give people a few months to vote for builds they want archived for the ages.\u00a0\u00a0Repeat every year or two.\u00a0At that point, no automation is really needed, imo. Every build can be added manually to the ECB Guild Filter excel file in a satisfying amount of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want <em>me</em> to make the judgement call, well... I don't think I'm qualified for that. I'm not a good player or builder and I certainly don't have any pedigree - I just appeared two weeks ago and started posting. I <em>could</em>\u00a0put together a list of builds added the last [<em>insert time range</em>] that are not already in the filter, and then after you or the other admins/mods have approved, just add them manually.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm really just trying to get a sense of scale here. If we're talking <em>hundreds, upon hundreds</em>\u00a0of builds to add or investigate, then yeah, that's not feasible to do without some level of automation.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>Maybe we could pursue through PMs?</div></blockquote>\nI wouldn't mind that, but maybe Empyre or Mick Dagger have something to contribute?<br/>\n<blockquote><div><span style=\"color:#ffffff\"><span style=\"font-size:75%;line-height:normal\">Oh</span></span><span style=\"color:#ffffff\"><span style=\"font-size:75%;line-height:normal\">, and what would you prefer: Hero Finder?

Maybe a title will come in time if I prove useful. :)<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, are there any plans of linking the guild filter and legacy archives together? I really like the search feature of the archives and it's annoying having to look different places for builds. Just something I've been wondering.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Oh bollocks, another one who can do multiple quotes. Please forgive me my simplicity.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thinking is that any \"new\" builds in the level 40/ 30/ 20/ Free forums should be included. It's not a qualitative judgement, other than the rules have been followed - and that's not just me being arsey - the point is that others should be able to pick up those builds and run with them, knowing their qualities and down-sides in advance. If there are issues with any of them, then the mods and admins (as obvious gods) can shift/ add to/ remove from/ delete them as appropriate (ain't power grand?). But we may miss a thing or two, so questions should rightly be asked. When I did Hip's grunt-work on the current filter it took 2 or 3 months (though he did a whole lot more), but that was starting from us having nothing. And of course at that time the Legacy/ WoG Archive hadn't been reactivated. If there is a way to merge the two, that would be stupendous, but I'd stand more chance of licking the Queen of England's ear than doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally - and I haven't checked this with Mick or Empyre - I really don't like the collective idea for finalized builds. They are either finalized or they are not. People play in different styles, with different companions (or not), and in different environments. If a build works to whichever level, who are we to judge its efficacy? And if there are issues, they should come in the discussions about said build, which should then help anyone attempting to go on and play that build.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as PMs are concerned - as <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">a god</span> an admin, I can share them with Mick and Empyre (wouldn't want a mad Viking or Texan, or both, on my case, after all!), so that's not a concern.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, take what name you're given and be grateful <span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83d\ude0b</span><br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

Many of these builds would probably crash the parser (I know <em>yours do</em>\u00a0wink wink).

What are we talking, 20 - 30 builds? I'm already at number 7, so I think it's best just to get it done.<br/>\n<br/>\nAddressing your idea specifically: Something like that could (and should imo) be done but I'd still have to make the parser more flexible and change the output - output is no big deal, flexible parser is. I've been thinking of making a \"skill dumper\" utility that automatically spreads skill points out from ending stats and class progression - that could probably be useful for that and in general.

When I'm done scribing (I'll be out of XP and Gold hehehe) I'll start working on an alpha version for our very own ECB Build Archive with a neat search function like the Legacy Archives. All the data is there, beautifully organized so it shouldn't be too complicated. When the basics are down, we can even use the ECB Guild Filter's data for even more flexible searching.<br/>\n<br/>\nE: <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"><em class=\"mention\">@Orion2019</em>\u00a0 <em class=\"mention\">@Valerfor</em>\u00a0<em class=\"mention\">@Stagmeister</em>\u00a0If you PM me an e-mail address I can add you so you can edit the file directly for convenience. </span>Don't do that.</div>"
