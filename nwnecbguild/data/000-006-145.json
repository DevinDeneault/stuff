From Elements, and various Summoning Wands, and Wand of Lesser Breach.\u00a0 These are handy in the event you get dispelled.\u00a0 At Level 7 craft your first Wand of ILMS (it\u2019s crafted at 11<sup>th</sup> caster power which is uber when you are Level 7.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nUse Breaches to strip enemy casters of their protection shields and damage shields.\u00a0 Also, don\u2019t forget <br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>Weaknesses:</strong>\u00a0 You\u2019re not a true Wizard.\u00a0 You are subject to dispelling for most of your career.\u00a0 The more Wizard levels you take, the more you can mitigate it.\u00a0 It\u2019s not until you reach Level 25 Wizard that you become truly undispellable\u2014except for Mords and Breaches.\u00a0 Those are still going to get you, but they get everybody.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
