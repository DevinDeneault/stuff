These aren't everything, <br/>\nbut it is what I found more interesting &amp; affects the gameplay most.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Assassins with Death Attack can now use<br/>\nImproved Sneak Attack without having <br/>\nSneak Attack 1.<br/>\n2) Assassin\u2019s Death Attack paralysis length is based<br/>\nonly on assassin level, not total character level.<br/>\n3) Assassin\u2019s Death Attack balanced to only fire once<br/>\nper round (first attack).<br/>\n4) Fix to Uncanny Dodge 2 feat (higher-level rogues<br/>\nare now allowed to attack lesser rogues with<br/>\nSneak/Death attacks)<br/>\n5) Monk\u2019s Circle Kick: When current target leaves<br/>\nmaximum attack range, we will now pick a new<br/>\ntarget within attack range instead of standing and<br/>\ndoing nothing<br/>\n6) Defensive Stance mode will be canceled properly<br/>\nwhen casting a spell or using an item<br/>\n7) Greater Sanctuary now stacks properly with<br/>\nInvisibility (True Seeing no longer pierces both<br/>\neffects)<br/>\n8) Monk\u2019s Stunning Fist: Balance change to last only<br/>\none round instead of three rounds<br/>\n9) For feat-based spells (such as Harper Scout sleep),<br/>\nGetSpellSaveDC now computed properly when<br/>\nthe base ability score for the character is <br/>\nless than 10.<br/>\n10) Extra spell slots earned from items are<br/>\nunreadied instead of cleared when shapeshifting/polymorphing.<br/>\n11) Removed ability for shapeshifting players to<br/>\nabuse the UI and use their normal spells while<br/>\nshapeshifted.<br/>\n<br/>\nHm, some nice fixes but some (unnecessary IMO) big nerfs too.<br/>\nAssassins won't be happy.<br/>\nCould not find anything for Rakshasas, <br/>\nbut It might be on some post-release patch.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I should post this somewhere else with its own topic, perhaps,<br/>\nas more &amp; more people appear that play the Enhanced Edition.</div>"
