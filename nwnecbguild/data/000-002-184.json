The highest average damage per round would be from a strength-based Weapon Master with a scythe, unless the target is immune to critical hits, in which case the greatsword and greataxe are pretty much equivalent to each other.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Later, Kail (?) posted a revised version of it with a scimitar and way more reliable anyway but of course, it didn't have that huge number (slightly over 2000 dmg in a single hit). For something WAY more practical you may want to see something like this,<br/>\n<br/>\nHarvester Of Souls =&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/harvester-of-souls-ftr-10-pal-5-wm-25-t2354285.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">harvester-of-souls-ftr-10-pal-5-wm-25-t2354285.html</a><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">The thing about a smiter tho, is that the smite itself gives extra AB that is not restricted by the +20 cap to AB. Meaning if you have a ton of charisma, you get that to your AB. 38 + 20 + let's say 26 charisma and +12 from items(14)= 82 on 3 smite evil attacks. This is by no means shabby and will hit just as well as a WM with 28 levels.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Here's a few.<br/>\nIt's already been mentioned that the highest damage single strike is a smite, and the most HP removed at once is an area instant death spell or turn undead, or a lucky series of great cleave devcrits.<br/>\nThe highest Devastating Critical DC is 53, <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/panthro-the-strongest-dever-in-the-world-fighter-1-t2354901.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> build makes it an effective 55 if you can cap Str.<br/>\nThe highest instant death save is versus a DC 48 Implosion. 50 (38+12) WIS, ESF: Evo, Implosion has an innate +3 DC.<br/>\nWith mundane items only, what's the highest damage per round against a crittable 0 AC target dummy? I'm not sure, but a max Str 10 APR Ranger/Cleric 15+/Monk with Bane of Enemies, and FE: target dummies :) won't do too bad (beats fists because of the fire DF (the magical DF applies to fists too.))<br/>\nThe highest DPR achievable against a single target requires a 10 APR enemy if you have damage shields and can get hit reliably.<br/>\nFor a trapper who knows how to stack them (or -oh, the horror- pauses the game), all bets are off.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a not too high magic environment, there isn't much that <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-magical-master-cleric-15-wizard-23-monk-2-t515401.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-magical-master-cleric-15-wizard-23-monk-2-t515401.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this guy</a> can't handle (especially if you replace the TW feats with say, BF, KD and craft wand.)
