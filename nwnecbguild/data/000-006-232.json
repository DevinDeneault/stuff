All characters are being revisited in light of the patch, and Friar Tuck, which was in development at the time but never did get around to making his debut (on account of NWN2 among other things), finally coming out from my stable and into the Wildwoods so as to join the series proper. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat follows is Lionheart, the Wildwood Crusader, whom I have taken the liberty of breaking up into two variants (on account of the changes to the holy sword): the first being an epic Ranger with two-weapon foci bolstered by Paladin\u2019s DM/DS, etc. (King and Military leader going off to battle and the Crusades) the other sees Lionheart as a classic Crusader/epic Paladin(military) bolstered by Ranger Dual-Wield (returning from the field and restoring his throne). Either way, Ranger / Paladin makes for a deadly er Just and Divine combination, such that those who dare stand and plot against HIS England quite simply do not succeed, and just don\u2019t live that long. This build is the Epic Ranger Version (to see the Epic Paladin version, click: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/lionheart-wildwood-crusader-paladin-pal24-ranger10-cot6-t2297873.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">lionheart-wildwood-crusader-paladin-pal24-ranger10-cot6-t2297873.html</a>  ). Without any further ado, please meet:</div></blockquote>\n<br/>\n<strong><br/>\nLIONHEART (Wildwood Crusader)</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Concept: The King who Roared</strong><br/>\nLionheart, being Richard I (or King Richard), a noble knight and gallant soldier, and rightful ruler of England who was also a crusader; he left his kingdom temporarily in the care of his relative, John (Sorcerer King, Wildwood Prince, placeholder ) while he sought answers and justice to alleged crimes committed abroad, meanwhile leaving his own kingdom open to crimes committed against his subjects by John and his own system of Sheriffs (and especially the Sheriff of Nottingham, Wildwood Tyrant, placeholder ). <br/>\n<br/>\nControversial yet charming, Lionheart endured much back-stabbing and constant threats, which he faced with the pride and persistence of a lion. He also enjoyed many an exciting adventure, was extremely well educated, and able to converse in many languages, but his true passion was that of a soldier, excelling in military matters from a very young age; his main concern at all times was that of his kingdom\u2019s national security (and thus the comfort of his subjects), which was constantly under threat from foreign powers. For the people, then, Lionheart endured much personal hardship, including being kidnapped and held against his will by foreign powers. He had loyal supporters such as Robin Hood (as a \u201ctrue-to-life\u201d plate-wearing knight, in Wildwood Warrior: placeholder , or in accordance with the tales, as an archer, in the Wildwood Outlaw: placeholder ) and his merry band of the woods (including Friar Tuck, the Wildwood Monk: placeholder, Alan A. Dale, the Wildwood Minstrel: placeholder, Will Scarlett, the Wildwood Mercenary: placeholder), Little John, Wildwood Lieutenant: placeholder, and last but by no means least, the famous Lady Marian, a high borne intelligent noble who cared deeply about her people (Wildwood Maiden, placeholder). <br/>\n<br/>\nLionheart was able to escape his ordeal, no worse for the wear, being bent and determined on nothing more than returning to his throne and rescuing his kingdom from the evil forces who had taken over during his absence. England, he vowed, would be freed from her nightmare, and her enemies--including and especially Prince John \u201cthe Usurper,\u201d in: Sorcerer King, Wildwood Prince: placeholder, and the Sheriff of Nottingham, as the Wildwood Tyrant: placeholder -- would suffer the full extent of his divine wrath. He was, after all, Lionheart, and his enemies would hear him roar. <br/>\n<strong><br/>\nLionheart, Wildwood Crusader (Epic Ranger version),<br/>\nRanger(26), Paladin(4), Champion of Torm(10)</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>I.

In terms of PvM/E, sneak/crit immunes (i.e., Undeads and Constructs) are always a good choice generally speaking, choosing your other FEs in accordance with your own needs/environs; if looking to play the OC and without giving away any spoilers add Dwarves, Humans and Elves.
