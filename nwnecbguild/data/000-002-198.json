I tried to search somewhere in this new and the old ecb guilds, but found nothing...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

This can shed some light upon this matter. <br/>\nNow that I remember, I haven't done any check on exotic weapons: maybe the bastard sword and the katana (the only exotic weapons wielded with one hand by medium size people) can be grabbed by gnomes and halflings with two hands...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe weapons normally handled with two-hands by humans, elves, etc. can't surely be used by gnomes and halflings...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Either someone was playing with baseitems.2da or otherwise being creative with some other settings. But, without such tweaking, a small creature shouldn't be able to equip a large weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Note that making custom weapons of other sizes is quite possible. For instance, CEP has a tiny spear that is\u00a0 a medium weapon, usable small creatures as a two-handed weapon.)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

However, I won't ever use it with a little character (it's been a while that it is in my inventory, not used, but ready for it), in order to play fairly (the only thing that matters to me).
