Looks like 11 from your summary, but you need at least 14 in a low magic environment and max out Perform otherwise your Bard Song will not gain power with your Bard levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nI usually take no more than two Fighter levels and keep pure Bard for the rest unless you are going past level 14 or so. The Curse Song (feat) is incredibly powerful and a must have for a Bard, especially at low levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy! <br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my 2014817 using Tapatalk<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>"

And, keep in mind that CHA-based casters only get to choose known spells at level-up and the PC has no buffing effects considered during level-up (same reason an INT=10 toon wearing a +3 INT ring still doesn't qualify for Expertise during level-up). So, it seems unlikely that a CHA=13 toon would even be able to <em>choose </em>any level 4 spells to know.</div>"

Even with a +3 INT ring equipped, he could not access any level 2 slots. I also equipped a Wanderer's Ring with bonus wizard slots from level 1 - 4. Still no slots available above level 1. Looks like a toon needs to meet the casting ability requirement for a given level of spell to even have access to slots of that level for any purpose. (I haven't tested with a spontaneous caster.)</div>"
