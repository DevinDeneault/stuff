So here i am again with the new EE version and want to actually know what im doing this time around.<br/>\n\u00a0If you could please help me understand the differences and choose one of these 3 builds and just help a general noob learn to play.<br/>\nHere are the builds i found that focus on Druid and Dragon shape or shape shifting<br/>\n1.<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-wild-heart-focused-rakhasa-dragon-shifter-28-d-t2355079.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the-wild-heart-focused-rakhasa-dragon-s ... 55079.html</a><br/>\n2.<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-world-ender-druid-32-fighter-2-monk-6-t2355416.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the-world-ender-druid-32-fighter-2-monk-6-t2355416.html</a><br/>\n3.<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/viewtopic.php?p=16163#p16163\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">viewtopic.php?p=16163#p16163</a></div>"

In terms of PWs World of Greyhawk would be my choice, Maximillan Kane, Grizzled_Dwarflord and Kail Pendragon (and definitely myself) would have playtested the dragon builds there, it is renowned for being a challenging environment, so some may or may not like that.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hello and welcome aboard, n8tronic!<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers will have to help you when it comes to Persistent Worlds (though we do have a forum for them here in the Guild), but when it comes to modules, I would recommend Aielund above all - not that there's anything wrong with the others Orion cites. If you fancy Mines of Twin Summits (very high magic by the end), you probably want to play the OC first, as it's meant to take a character from about level 16/17 to 40. Equally, Sands of Fate is a good follow-on from SoU/HotU, as it takes you from around level 27 to 40. Pop down to our Modules forum for more details.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs to the skill points for the World Ender, I'm afraid only GDL can truly break his schedule down, but if it helps...<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly take Animal Empathy and Spellcraft on Druid levels. Only take Hide, Listen, Move Silently and Tumble (and take Tumble in batches of 5) on Monk levels. Only take Concentration and Discipline on Fighter or Monk levels (I'm afraid I can't remember atm whether Conc is a Druid skill or not, sorry). You can take Heal on whichever class you like, but Spot will have to be cross-classed as it isn't a skill any of the classes have. Essentially, \"cross-classed\" means you can only take a point in it every other level, so you can only get to half the max skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that makes sense and is at least of a little use.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

      "content": "<div>Oh, it's easily possible to mess up the points - done it myself plenty of times. One thing I've learned, though, if you save them up, you can always use them at your next level-up, or the one after, or whenever (skill points save in Neverwinter, which is a real blessing). For example, with the World Ender you've got 6 levels of Monk, and each level in that class (with 14 INT and being human) gets 7 skill points to distribute. Now, on those Monk levels you need to take, as a minimum, all your Hide, Listen, Move Silently and Tumble ranks. That means you're going to have to save some skill points from when you take another class so you can use them when you next take a level in Monk. GDL takes Monk at levels 7, 12, 17, and 22, which is no accident, because they are perfect for dropping in 10, then 5, then 5, and another 5 ranks in Tumble. He takes the final 2 levels at 30 and 40 because he has other priorities at that stage - or he'd have taken them at either 27 (or 32) and 37, so you'll need to take another 5 points at 30 and the remaining 10 at 40. The knack is simply to remember to take what you need when you can, and save any spare points for when you need them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfraid I can't help as far as Steam goes. I'm still playing v1.69 from disc, with all my downloads from the Vault. I know, I know...Others will be able to offer guidance, though, I'm sure. (Oh, and don't turn into a dragon when you're in a dungeon, unless it's got really big doors and a high ceiling. Just a tip.)<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

One thing I've learned, though, if you save them up, you can always use them at your next level-up, or the one after, or whenever (skill points save in Neverwinter, which is a real blessing). For example, with the World Ender you've got 6 levels of Monk, and each level in that class (with 14 INT and being human) gets 7 skill points to distribute. Now, on those Monk levels you need to take, as a minimum, all your Hide, Listen, Move Silently and Tumble ranks. That means you're going to have to save some skill points from when you take another class so you can use them when you next take a level in Monk. GDL takes Monk at levels 7, 12, 17, and 22, which is no accident, because they are perfect for dropping in 10, then 5, then 5, and another 5 ranks in Tumble. He takes the final 2 levels at 30 and 40 because he has other priorities at that stage - or he'd have taken them at either 27 (or 32) and 37, so you'll need to take another 5 points at 30 and the remaining 10 at 40. The knack is simply to remember to take what you need when you can, and save any spare points for when you need them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfraid I can't help as far as Steam goes. I'm still playing v1.69 from disc, with all my downloads from the Vault. I know, I know...Others will be able to offer guidance, though, I'm sure. (Oh, and don't turn into a dragon when you're in a dungeon, unless it's got really big doors and a high ceiling. Just a tip.)<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div></blockquote>\nOk so i noticed he has a final number for the skill points. Is it not possible just to stick to those skills and end up with that number? So if I just Max the 3 druid skills at each level up and leave whats leftover and then when monk comes dump all my tumble in there and if he has a few ranks in hide and move silently put a few points into there. Then on druid levels keep maxing his 3 skills then when monk comes again dump all the tumble again etc. This should work no? Just make sure i never go over his posted number?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a side note if i just fumble around and explore the areas fully will i be able to get most of the gameplay and secrets? I know from playing some planescape that if you dont choose certain dialogue at a certain time you can miss so really good items and stuff. Is that the case for nwn</div>"

For this build, I would suggest you always have sufficient skill points in your arsenal to max Concentration, Spellcraft and Tumble whenever you can (in other words, making you as good as you can be at casting and resisting spells, and boosting your AC every five levels or so). My own second tier would be Animal Empathy, Discipline, and Listen, closely followed by Hide and Move Silently. Leaving Heal and Spot as pretty much luxury items.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will put a huge disclaimer on this. First, I don't play casters, so may be wildly off-beam.

Bear / Dire Bear form -&gt; highest AB/strength of the animal shapes, its great for damage, can carry mountains of loot, with Monk AC it covers its weakness (low AC) and Monk UBAB is pretty nice with it<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Water elemental / Elder water elemental form -&gt; I like this form over the others as it has a nice balance between stats ie AB / AC etc compared with the other elementals. It is mind immune, petrify immune, paralysis immune, critical hit immune, sneak immune, immune to fire damage, disease. AB / Damage is more than the Bear form, but infinite elemental shapes come later than infinite wildshapes.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Ancient Green Dragon or Ancient Blue Dragon shape -&gt; acid or electrical immunity is pretty good with no elemental vulnerabilities. I like the acid immunity better so I can ignore Mestil's Acid Sheath in battle. Ancient Red Dragon is situational if there is a big fire damage user\u00a0</div>"

Bear / Dire Bear form -&gt; highest AB/strength of the animal shapes, its great for damage, can carry mountains of loot, with Monk AC it covers its weakness (low AC) and Monk UBAB is pretty nice with it<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Water elemental / Elder water elemental form -&gt; I like this form over the others as it has a nice balance between stats ie AB / AC etc compared with the other elementals. It is mind immune, petrify immune, paralysis immune, critical hit immune, sneak immune, immune to fire damage, disease. AB / Damage is more than the Bear form, but infinite elemental shapes come later than infinite wildshapes.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Ancient Green Dragon or Ancient Blue Dragon shape -&gt; acid or electrical immunity is pretty good with no elemental vulnerabilities. I like the acid immunity better so I can ignore Mestil's Acid Sheath in battle. Ancient Red Dragon is situational if there is a big fire damage user\u00a0</div></blockquote>\nAfter playing for quite some time now I have a few more questions that I cant seem to find answers for. <br/>\nI have Chromatic breastplate which gives elements resistance/ 10 now if i use a protection from elements spell does it stack with my armor? <br/>\nAlso does the endure elements and protection from elements spell line stack? Or does the strongest one overwrite the rest?<br/>\nThankyou</div>"

I haven't played a shifter or druid, so can't pass comment on whether merging impacts on that. I'm sure others will know.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Web's aforementioned cheese is for the UBAB, not the speed. The Robes of the Dark Moon you mention earlier do still grant Haste, though, and are (imho) the best you'll get for a monk in the OC, and they free up your boots slot for those great monk slippers of the Sun Soul (up to +5 in the OC, iirc) for another +5 to AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Oh, and unless things are different from normal in shifted forms, you'd also lose your whopping 13 Monk AC wisdom bonus if you carry a shield or wear armour (again, hats are fine).</div>",

If you find yourself fighting in druid form in early levels since bear form is limited do you typically wear monk gear? Haste robes are awesome and i bought a pair of gloves of the rose +3 which adds +3 and +1 electrical. Or do you have a completely different set you wear while human form? <br/>\nIt seems like just fighting like a monk at this point with bare hands has been better than my shield and desert wind scimitar.</div>"

So my group of 4 just roam around fully buffed and just steamroll everything so far. The toughest fight was the Lich lord? In ch2 graveyard but only because he managed to strip all my buffs and wasnt prepared the first time. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have fought him like ten times just trying out different spells and strategies on tougher opponents. I can go toe to toe with Vardoc without help pretty easily when fully buffed. Improved expertise is amazing for those kind of warrior fights where they reliably hit and do big damage</div>"
