      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Having recently become enamored of the many awesome features of the Monk class, and inspired by Valerfor's Sword Saint builds, <br/>\nI thought to put together my own version.  Intrigued by Blackguard, and not having played one before, I ran the combo through the<br/>\nCBC and came up with something pretty solid.  There are a number of monk/blackguards in the Epic Character Search Engine, but only one with this<br/>\nclass combination:  <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build215334.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Infernal Mantis</a>, which is a drastically different animal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis came together pretty nicely: 42 AB, decent 2H damage, nice Taunt, Epic Vrock, and the laundry list of Monk abilities, including the highly addictive move speed.<br/>\nUnfortunately, no stylish robes, no UMD, not enough skill points, and delayed Improved Evasion and mind immunity for earlier Epic Fiend.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf the thematically correct weapon choices - no-dachi (greatsword), naginata (halberd), or ono (greataxe) - I chose the naginata mostly for<br/>\nthe more awesome attack animations; the dual damage types and x3 crits are nice as well.  (Unfortunately, I'm finding a shortage of good halberds on WoG.)<br/>\n<br/>\nSome tweaking would allow for stealth or Dev Crit.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe name comes from a kind of Japanese steel: created this build this while impatiently waiting on my new kitchen knife, a Hiromoto 190mm santoku made of Aogami Super.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk(20), Blackguard(18), Fighter(2), Human<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 16 (30)<br/>\nDEX: 10<br/>\nCON: 14<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 14<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Monk(1): Blind Fight, Expertise, {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}<br/>\n02: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus<br/>\n03: Monk(2): Toughness, {Deflect Arrows}<br/>\n04: Monk(3): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n05: Fighter(2): Power Attack<br/>\n06: Monk(4): Lightning Reflexes<br/>\n07: Monk(5)<br/>\n08: Monk(6): STR+1, {Knockdown, Improved Knockdown}, (STR=18)<br/>\n09: Blackguard(1): Great Fortitude<br/>\n10: Blackguard(2): {Smite Good}<br/>\n11: Blackguard(3)<br/>\n12: Monk(7): STR+1, Improved Critical, (STR=19)<br/>\n13: Blackguard(4)<br/>\n14: Blackguard(5)<br/>\n15: Blackguard(6): Divine Might<br/>\n16: Blackguard(7): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n17: Monk(8)<br/>\n18: Blackguard(8): Divine Shield<br/>\n19: Blackguard(9)<br/>\n20: Blackguard(10): STR+1, (STR=21)<br/>\n21: Blackguard(11): Epic Weapon Focus<br/>\n22: Monk(9): {Improved Evasion}<br/>\n23: Blackguard(12)<br/>\n24: Blackguard(13): STR+1, Great Strength I, Epic Prowess, (STR=23)<br/>\n25: Blackguard(14)<br/>\n26: Blackguard(15)<br/>\n27: Blackguard(16): Great Strength II, Epic Fiendish Servant, (STR=24)<br/>\n28: Monk(10): STR+1, (STR=25)<br/>\n29: Monk(11)<br/>\n30: Monk(12): Epic Skill Focus: Taunt<br/>\n31: Monk(13)<br/>\n32: Monk(14): STR+1, (STR=26)<br/>\n33: Monk(15): Great Strength III, (STR=27)<br/>\n34: Monk(16)<br/>\n35: Monk(17)<br/>\n36: Blackguard(17): STR+1, Armor Skin, (STR=28)<br/>\n37: Monk(18)<br/>\n38: Monk(19)<br/>\n39: Monk(20): Great Strength IV, (STR=29)<br/>\n40: Blackguard(18): STR+1, (STR=30)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 480<br/>\nSkillpoints: 261<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 32/20/23<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +4, Mind Effects: +2<br/>\nBAB: 28<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 42 (melee), 29 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 24/31<br/>\nSpell Casting: <br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nConcentration 43(45), Disable Trap 1(3), Discipline 43(53), Heal 5(4), Hide 5(5), Listen 42(41), Open Lock 1(1), Spellcraft 18(20), Taunt 43(55), Tumble 40(40)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Now it all depends from how badly you want \"Listen\" in your skill list. If you change your starting attributes to STR 17, DEX 08, INT 13 you will need one less Great STR epic feat to reach 30. Take the fourth FTR lvl in it's place and grab both WS/ EWS ending in the same 30 STR but gain +6 Dmg.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n* I think it is also time to test my new trick Empyre taught me, <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dwrl5CwE1s\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#0000FF\">Aogami Knife</span></a><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I waffled about going for WS/EWS, but sacrificed the +6 damage for the effective +6 AB.  Such are the sacrifices we make in character building...<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a better halberd in WoG than the Lance of the Paynim?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n(Thanks to Empyre, I too learned something:  <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVEa2gCYZKw\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AS Santoku</a>.

My low-level testing was insufficient (I only have the char to lvl 16 on WoG).  <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a perceptible speed increase at Monk 3, and seemingly at M6, in heavy armor.  It seemed logical that the speed continued to increase, but having now tested heavy armor on a much higher level monk, it does not.  I found a reputable-sounding source in the old ECB that claimed monk speed was unaffected by armor, and I wanted to believe it...alas.  Fortunately, SR and immunities aren't affected.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
