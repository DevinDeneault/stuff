A buddy and I want to start a co-op game and seeing all the effort here that's gone into character builds, I'm wondering if there might be a guide for two player co-op.\u00a0 What are some builds that work well together?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm used to playing some kind of Fighter/Thief and my partner is a cowardly Sorcerer. But I gather NWN is going to be a bit more complicated.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Oh, and hello and welcome, btw!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt took me a long time to adjust to Neverwinter from Baldur's. It wasn't so much the rule changes as the lack of a party, because Neverwinter is predominantly a solo or minimally co-oped game. Thus, many of the builds you'll find here are completely self-sufficient and require no companions. There are hundreds - if not thousands - of options just for solo play, so the multipliers involved for a co-op guide would be astronomical!<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, a Fighter/Rogue (not a Thief anymore) type should give a good melee presence - though you'll have to decide whether you want a strength or dexterity based one. And a caster of some kind - Wizard/ Sorcerer/ Bard or a more Divine rooted one - would make a worthy addition.<br/>\n<br/>\nGive us a few more details of the kind of build(s) you're looking for and we'll be happy to oblige.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Lots of interesting Fighter builds are posted, some with Cleric capabilities. Arcane Archer looks like fun, so how about Ranger/Cleric/Arcane Archer?\u00a0 Or maybe Druid instead of Cleric? <br/>\n<br/>\nFor the magic user, I lean to the Wizard over the Sorcerer for the variety of spells and the added skills. We could go Rogue (or Bard?) as a second class. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'd love to find something resembling these, so I won't have to go in blind regarding skills and feats. For now, I'm still trying to decide the ones I want.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\nCharles<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

So you can easily drop Ranger and look for other combos.<br/>\nBard is a very strong class for party play, primarily because of the effects the songs have on the party and the enemies. <br/>\nAA is the class that has most to offer if you want an archer.<br/>\nIf you want a wizard  then rogue as minor class has much to offer with its wide selection of class skills boosted by the extra skill points granted by the wizards high intelligence.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That thread told me why it's a false synergy in NwN, and doesn't work nearly as well as in BG. Another problem with going for an Arcane Archer is that it requires at least 1 level of Bard, Sorcerer or Wizard. Cleric doesn't qualify.<br/>\n<br/>\nA Ranger (or Fighter, or CoT)/ Cleric/ Monk could work well, and have decent Zen Archery, but I offer no guarantees - others will have wiser thoughts than I.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, have to go for now - I'll look at the second build later.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Also, there is a limit on what type of items one will find or can purchase, create, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have a section here with level 20 builds - <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/preepic-level-20-builds-f6/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">preepic-level-20-builds-f6/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nUsing any one of these will lead to better results. <br/>\n<br/>\nNormally, I would suggest a Tank character (meaning one that can stand and fight, and reasonable expect to survive some blows as well as dish some damage out) and a nuker (which means someone who can really deal the AoE (Area of Effect) damage.\u00a0 Having some healing will be helpful, but not absolutely necessary as healing is always available via the Recall Stone and Temple.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe NWN OC will first take you through the Prelude (I seriously cannot believe that Mick died there, but perhaps he got critted). It is basically a \"how to do the basics\" of NWN.\u00a0 Movement, access inventory, the character sheet, basic combat, ranged combat, etc.\u00a0 And it does a pretty good job of this imo.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut once leaving the Prelude, things get complicated, quickly.\u00a0 You will be offered a choice of paths you can take.\u00a0 What is important to note about the different paths, is that they favor different classes (meaning they offer different strengths/weaknesses in the form of challenge).\u00a0 Where one build will thrive, another may struggle a bit due to how the areas are tailored.\u00a0 <br/>\n<br/>\nLater, the challenge will pick up as the more complicated abilities, feats, and spells, etc become available (both for and against you) - it is seriously possible to totally gimp your build to the point of absolute uselessness.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing builds from the link I have provided will go a long way towards avoiding that fate.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, after getting through the learning curve, it is basically as I said - anyone and their grandmother can beat the OC with a sharp stick.\u00a0 It is made to be like this.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that one might want to know is that Bards have it easiest in the OC due to Bioware bias.\u00a0 I guess they considered Bards weak, or something.\u00a0 Anyways, having a Bard along is going to really boost the viability of your game.\u00a0 Just get to know the intricacies of Bard Song and Curse Song and you will be good to go.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not sure how the OC handles co-op play in regards to XP.\u00a0 I do know that using Henchmen and Familiars/Summons reduces XP, so there is that.\u00a0 Not that it is going to be a major factor in the game - as I have previously mentioned, the OC is not designed to be difficult (with some noteable exceptions).\u00a0 Those exceptions are well documented these days (not like it was when I first played the game back when it first came out) and strategies and tactics with how to deal with them are readily online.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I will suggest is this : if one gets \"stuck\" (like with the Dire Spider) then one should go another way, earn XP, level up, then come back later.\u00a0 This will often unlock abilities, feats, items, etc that will make a previous encounter that was difficult a breeze.<br/>\n<br/>\nI envy you that this is all new - I wonder how far it will take you and your co-op buddy.\u00a0 If you both like what you experience, you might want to skip Modules altogether and go for the Online (Persistent World) experience.\u00a0 With hordes of different custom created worlds out there, the amount of fun one gets for the basic cost of the game is basically unlimited.\u00a0 This also goes for the custom created Modules, of course, but Persistent Worlds where there are lots of players really changes how the game feels.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt completes it imo.<br/>\n<br/>\nI play on the World of Greyhawk.\u00a0 It is a Persistent World that is based on the original World of Greyhawk intellectual property of Gary E. Gygax, the creator of D&amp;D (some say co-creator).\u00a0 It is a pretty hardcore world, but it contains most of the D&amp;D modules that a lot of us grew up playing in Pen and Paper (PnP) and is quite nostalgic in that sense (though it is based in the more recent timelines of Greyhawk, so there is that).\u00a0 It is probably not the first stop for a beginner, as it is a rather difficult environment, harsh and challenging (even for those of us who consider themselves experienced).\u00a0 <br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever you do choose to do, I hope it leads to hours and hours of fun and excitement, as it has for me all these many, many years.<br/>\n<br/>\nNWN is an exception, a jewel, a bright star, that stands out from all others as a game.\u00a0 There will most likely never again be a game quite like it in our lifetimes.\u00a0 It's worth a play, and even more worth a stay.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing does have to be said here - if you are planning to do the OC, then go into SoU and HotU, you should be aware that the OC does NOT go into SoU!\u00a0 Basically, SoU is another version of the OC, in that it is for beginning characters.\u00a0 It was made due to a screaming majority asking for better RP elements, storyline, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nHotU can be played from both the OC and from SoU, dependingly.\u00a0 It is basically your \"Epic Adventure\" in a nutshell - and it does accomplish this.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever you do or decide, I wish you fun!\u00a0 I am very confident that NWN can provide you with exactly that, regardless of the form that one is used to.\u00a0 There is a flavor for everyone.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
