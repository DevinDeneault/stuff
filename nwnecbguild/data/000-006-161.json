Personally I loved my build in NWN2 which was F/B/RDD/BG but unfortunately NWN1 is limited to 3 classes and I was trying to find something similar. I am not sure if I should be posting in this thread as posting in MOGHEDIEN could be considered necroing, but as I am sure I will be modyfying it a bit to suit myself (and most likely making the build weaker but more fun to me) how essential is ESF: Perform feat to this build? Do ten additional points to perform matter that much?</div>"

Build is not supposed to be competitive (OCs, random modules with friends or solo, no additional mods, mostly CEP), just for fun. That is why I usually drop Great STR feats to get different ones and boost CHA or INT on base character. But it was so long when I last played NWN I am looking for good base. You intrigued me with Pale Master, this is something to look into. I usually I do not like class spells, I prefer UMD and scrolls for this. I like BG for boost to saves from CHA, and Pale Master for its own feats. I do not think Weapon Master is that fun to me - says someone to picks fighter (mostly for active different feats I could use). I think I will be looking into Bard/RDD/PM or Bard/RDD/BG, though I am undecided yet which one. I see a one handed, armored, shield type character. I guess more defensive one, but with power to withstand the enemy and hit them back.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn NWN2 I liked Epic Resilience feat :)<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, thanks for your suggestions and information!</div>"

One is slashing and the other bludgeoning. The sword is 2d6 damage, the flail is 1d10, so we're looking at tiny margins - particularly given that you're expending nothing feat-wise and have colossal Str to add to your dev crit DC.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf course, environment plays a part - who are the enemies and what is the availability of the respective weapons? For example, if I was playing Panthro in Aielund (not that I've noticed, of course - and Aielund doesn't have Dev Crit anyway) then a greatsword would be the better option because there are some brilliant ones there, but very few - if any - superb heavy flails.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

In fact you could call me a green noob. I hope I am not violating protocol by jumping in here to ask this, but my curiosity led me down this path.<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to use this build as a template for starting into my games. I started playing him to see how it \"feels\" and I love the concept of the brute force steamroller that Panthro represents. While playing, him, it started my RP story developing gears turning and an idea hit me. Can this build be modified down to a Gnome carrying a warhammer? Granted I will lose the +2 to strength of the Half-Orc, and further more lose an additional -2 to Strength by classing down to a Gnome, but would the build still be viable? I'm pretty certain that changing the race like this drastically changes everything, If so how would you change it around to make it work?\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nFor RP purposes, I am envisioning a small unimposing gnome that everyone teases for always carrying around his over sized warhammer. (Well, over sized for him at least) However, whenever the sh*t hits the fan, he suddenly rushes in cracking ankles and smashing kneecaps. To the casual observer, once he runs into the battle, all you see is these foes looking down trying to swing at something unseen while every few seconds a body drops mysteriously.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.</div>"
