Just thought up an interesting character idea, a bard that dual weilds hammers/maces to make his \"music\" in battle<br/>\n<br/>\n 1 PvM mainly, though it he can survive a bit of PvP all the better<br/>\n 2 Max lvl 30<br/>\n 3 Half orc, human, or half elf (Half Orc subraces generally have +2 to con while the elf subrace would have +2 to cha)<br/>\n 4 Bard with wm added at somepoint... preferably later on in the build (Need to complete a quest to aquire WM unless i'm mistaken)<br/>\n Build based around some form of blunt weapon, either dual weilding maces/light hammers or maybe warhammer/shield.\u00a0<br/>\n I'm not sure if Dex based is the way to go or Str based.<br/>\n Primary use of magic would be to buff self with maybe a stun or two thrown in<br/>\n Factors needed<br/>\n Build would be used on arelith so must take atleast 3 of a class before going to a different class<br/>\n \"Gifts\" can be taken for +2 to a stat, cannot be stacked (ex, no +4 dex, but could possibly have +2 dex +2 con)<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks for your time!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That's really tough. And as for the dexterity part, here is one thing. Always go strength-based in low level - low magic environments, can't stress that enough,<br/>\n<br/>\n I am assuming you are good with a warhammer and shield strength build, correct? Then we can make something that will work splendidly, How a Human (Bard 17/ Fighter 6/ Weapon Master 7) sounds to you?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
