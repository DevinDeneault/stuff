I debated craft wand and Improved Two Weapon Fighting, because craft wand would be nice for a party. Especially with darkness, since this character has high Hide/Move Silently. I stuffed in a few points of Disable Trap and Open lock, simply for the ability to open locks, and disable traps. I didn't get search, because of the 'Find Trap' spell that is available to bards. <br/>\n<br/>\nNotes:<br/>\n-Can get rid of any disable trap skill points, and stuff them into Open Lock. I chose not to, because some player worlds have modified the spell Find Traps to only reveal the traps.<br/>\n- Craft wand could be useful if you want to get rid of a feat. I'd get rid of Improved Two Weapon Fighting. One less offhand attack, but you still manage 6 attacks/round/ (Including your haste spell.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAdvantages<br/>\n- High Hide/MS<br/>\n- Decent AB<br/>\n- Decent AC<br/>\n- Versatile<br/>\n- High Reflex Saves <br/>\n-Has Open Lock &amp; Disable Trap<br/>\n- Damage usually scores in the 50's. (7 Attacks per round = 350 Damage.)<br/>\n<br/>\nDisadvantages<br/>\n- Not many spell casts<br/>\n- Doesn't get complete +8 Saves from spellcraft. (Gets +7)<br/>\n- Low AC Unbuffed<br/>\n- Attack Bonus is not very high unbuffed<br/>\n<br/>\nOther Options<br/>\n-Instead of Bard 20/Rogue 15/Fighter 5, Bard 20 /Rogue <strong>19</strong>/<strong>SD 1</strong> may be a decent option)</div>"

But, I don't like the Rogue 19/Bard 11/Fighter 10, simply because then lasting inspiration is lost, which is a big cookie. I can see a 20 Bard/Rogue 16/CoT 4, though. That could be decent. I thought about maybe taking ranger instead, going Bard 20/Rogue 15/Ranger 5, or Bard 20/Rogue 16/Ranger 4 for free ambidexterity. Also giving me favored enemy. Or, the favored enemy bonus feat could be put to use in epic levels (If I took 5 Ranger), to get an epic bonus feat. Rangers also get extra stealth in areas that are outside.</div>"
