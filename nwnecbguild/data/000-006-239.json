      "content": "<div>Hail ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have been wanting to do a version of Gizz's Charnel Lord that packs a bit more Bard goodness. Turns out there are three builds that already go for that, but are somehow different than this guy:<br/>\n<br/>\nevo_dragon's <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build141309.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Undeath's Eternal Champion</a> which is a DEX-based toon,<br/>\n<br/>\nKail Pendragon's <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build253956.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mourning Glory</a> which goes for more Bard levels and less fighter.<br/>\n<br/>\nand Mith's <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build199696.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Doom Skald</a>, which is very similar, but goes for more pre-epic BAB and less AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis guy, however, has the same unbuffed AB as Mithdradates' build, EWS, which he doesn't get, but a much higher AC, thanks to EMA (attained at lvl 36). He has many gear slots free to cap Charisma, Constitution and Strength where I play, and having EMA, he can let go of the shield and use a Scythe to ALMOST have DevCrit. The only refined touch that Mith's build has that this one lacks is ESF:Taunt, but you can get that if you are willing to drop Epic Warding and delay Epic Mage Armor. Then, I would take the last PM level at 37th and only then go for EWS. To achieve that, I had to forego something, of course, and that something was HP (and Fort saves). But that weakness can be countered with gear.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO, with such a high AC, he won't really need HP that much, but there's always the casters. Nothing that a x4 Keen +5 Scythe critical hit can't handle. Anyway, here's my take on the Skeletal Musician:<br/>\n<br/>\nBard(16), Fighter(8), Pale Master(16), Human<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayable 1-40 PvM<br/>\n<br/>\nAlignment: any non-lawful<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 18 (30)<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 8<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 15 (16)<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Bard(1): Power Attack, Cleave<br/>\n02: Fighter(1): Weapon Proficiency Exotic<br/>\n03: Bard(2): Weapon Focus: Scythe<br/>\n04: Bard(3): STR+1, (STR=19)<br/>\n05: Bard(4)<br/>\n06: Bard(5): Extend Spell<br/>\n07: Bard(6)<br/>\n08: Bard(7): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n09: Bard(8): Curse Song<br/>\n10: Bard(9)<br/>\n11: Bard(10)<br/>\n12: Bard(11): STR+1, Lingering Song, (STR=21)<br/>\n13: Bard(12)<br/>\n14: Bard(13)<br/>\n15: Fighter(2): Knockdown, Improved Knockdown<br/>\n16: Fighter(3): STR+1, (STR=22)<br/>\n17: Bard(14)<br/>\n18: Fighter(4): Improved Critical: Scythe, Weapon Specialization: Scythe<br/>\n19: Fighter(5)<br/>\n20: Fighter(6): CHA+1, Blind Fight, (CHA=16)<br/>\n21: Pale Master(1): Armor Skin<br/>\n22: Pale Master(2)<br/>\n23: Pale Master(3): {Darkvision}<br/>\n24: Pale Master(4): STR+1, Epic Weapon Focus: Scythe, (STR=23)<br/>\n25: Pale Master(5)<br/>\n26: Pale Master(6)<br/>\n27: Pale Master(7): Epic Prowess<br/>\n28: Pale Master(8): STR+1, (STR=24)<br/>\n29: Pale Master(9)<br/>\n30: Pale Master(10): Great Strength I, (STR=25)<br/>\n31: Pale Master(11)<br/>\n32: Bard(15): STR+1, (STR=26)<br/>\n33: Pale Master(12): Great Strength II, (STR=27)<br/>\n34: Pale Master(13): Epic Energy Resistance: Acid I<br/>\n35: Pale Master(14)<br/>\n36: Pale Master(15): STR+1, Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor, (STR=28)<br/>\n37: Fighter(7)<br/>\n38: Fighter(8): Epic Weapon Specialization: Scythe<br/>\n39: Pale Master(16): Great Strength III, Epic Spell: Epic Warding, (STR=29)<br/>\n40: Bard(16): STR+1, (STR=30)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 255<br/>\nSkillpoints: 253<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 18/20/20<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9<br/>\nBAB: 26<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 40 (melee), 26 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 29/40<br/>\nSpell Casting: Bard(6)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscipline 43(53), Listen 30(29), Perform 27(30), Spellcraft 43(45), Taunt 43(46), Tumble 40(39), UMD 27(30)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Discipline(4), Listen(4), Perform(4), Spellcraft(4), Taunt(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), <br/>\n02: Discipline(1), Save(4), <br/>\n03: Discipline(1), Perform(2), Spellcraft(2), Taunt(2), Tumble(2), UMD(2), <br/>\n04: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), <br/>\n05: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), <br/>\n06: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), <br/>\n07: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), <br/>\n08: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), <br/>\n09: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), <br/>\n10: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), <br/>\n11: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), <br/>\n12: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), <br/>\n13: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), <br/>\n14: Discipline(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(1), <br/>\n15: Discipline(1), Save(5), <br/>\n16: Discipline(1), Save(9), <br/>\n17: Discipline(1), Perform(3), Spellcraft(3), Taunt(3), Tumble(3), UMD(3), <br/>\n18: Discipline(1), Save(4), <br/>\n19: Discipline(1), Save(8), <br/>\n20: Discipline(1), Save(12), <br/>\n21: Listen(3), Spellcraft(4), Save(10), <br/>\n22: Spellcraft(1), Save(14), <br/>\n23: Spellcraft(1), Save(18), <br/>\n24: Spellcraft(1), Save(22), <br/>\n25: Spellcraft(1), Save(26), <br/>\n26: Spellcraft(1), Save(30), <br/>\n27: Spellcraft(1), Save(34), <br/>\n28: Spellcraft(1), Save(38), <br/>\n29: Spellcraft(1), Save(42), <br/>\n30: Spellcraft(1), Save(46), <br/>\n31: Spellcraft(1), Save(50), <br/>\n32: Discipline(12), Perform(7), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(15), Tumble(15), UMD(7), <br/>\n33: Listen(4), Spellcraft(1), <br/>\n34: Listen(4), Spellcraft(1), <br/>\n35: Listen(4), Spellcraft(1), <br/>\n36: Listen(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(3), <br/>\n37: Discipline(5), Save(3), <br/>\n38: Discipline(1), Save(7), <br/>\n39: Spellcraft(3), Save(9), <br/>\n40: Discipline(2), Spellcraft(1), Taunt(8), Tumble(5), <br/>\n<br/>\nHis unbuffed AB is kind of lowish, but he can buff it very well:<br/>\n<br/>\n40 +6 Capped Strength, +2 Bard Song, +5 GMW, +5 Curse Song +1 Bless Potion +1 Aid Potion +6 Taunt (although he can't Taunt high-concentration types) = 66 AB.

Besides, most of the time, his AB won't be that great, because you need to be mindful of the Bard Song uses, and save them for the most important battles. Let's try to simulate what damage this guy would do on a critical hit:<br/>\n<br/>\n[2-8 (weapon damage) + 6 (EWS) + 24 (capped STR x 1.5) + 5 (GMW) + 3 (Bard Song)] x4= 160 - 184 on a regular critical hit with a normal Scythe.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther possible damage enhancements: Flame Weapon Wand (doesn't multiply on criticals), Bless Weapon Scroll (vs Undead only), Weapon Damage Bonus property (+1d6 typically where I play), +1d6 Holy Sword (vs Evil only), +1 (Prayer Scroll), +1 Divine Favor scroll (Magical Damage, and if your server, like mine, has caster level adjustment, if you buy your scrolls from a lvl 15+ Cleric, it can go up to +5), +2 Battletide scroll, +x Massive Criticals property (if applicable). There's still Deafening Clang for +3 Sonic damage (you can buy a wand with 50 charges where I play). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, there's much room for improvement so that his criticals reach the 200 mark easily, maybe even 250 against certain types of enemies. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I didn't even want to count another item, which is a server-specific thing, but on WoG there is a pendant which can grant you 3 daily uses of the Divine Might feat, and I had already planned to equip him with it if I ever got to play him there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the other suggestion, it's a good one, definitely worth doing, but by doing that, you'll delay the acquisition of lvl 5 spells (Extended Improved Invisibility) a bit. Definitely worth it, though, will do that!<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the feedback, Mick!<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hail!<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter Mick's suggestion, I reworked the build to enhance the saves and also decided to get rid of Epic Warding (a tweak I had suggested myself to be possible), since it's a very short duration buff anyway, and your AC should be high enough that you don't need it. I took ESF: Taunt instead, so now this guy should be able to Taunt even the high-Concentration mobs. Here's how the updated version looks. ESF Taunt can also be ESF DIscipline in placers where just a score of 59 + Bard Song bonus in Discipline isn't enough to keep you erect, but where I play it's better to go for Taunt.
