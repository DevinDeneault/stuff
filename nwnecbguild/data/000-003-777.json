      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Just was running around WoG playtesting my <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-divine-spell-bow-sorcerer-26-paladin-4-arcane--t2355216.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Divine Spell-bow build</a>, when I thought what about a melee type Spellsword, similar to Valerfor's\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-abjurant-champion-wizard-26-ftr-6-cot-8-t2354353.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Abjurant Champion</a>, but a Sorcerer / Paladin. Undispellability, EMA/EW, full spell book, you know all the good stuff except with divine damage / divine shield and sorcerer power! Of course RDD would have to be taken to boost the AB up...<br/>\n<br/>\nLooks like a few have tried to do this before however. But I've made something perhaps unique enough without knowing about it specifically.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've chosen to just take still spell rather than go down the Auto-Still Spell route. You should be able to cast every spell in full plate and tower with the still spell, except a handful of level 9 spells. A lot of buffs can be cast with this stuff unequipped.<br/>\n<br/>\nOf the level 9 spells, the two most valuable level 9 spells, Mordenkainen's Disjunction and Time Stop, do not have a somatic component. So they are purely verbal and do not incur chance of arcane spell failure with full plate / tower. The remaining spell(s) for level 9 could be a summon which can be cast outside of combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nGot a base AB of 41 which is nice. Only 3 attacks / round though. I guess the fourth attack rarely hits unless True Strike is active (or some other AC lowering)<br/>\n<br/>\nWith EMA / EW, RDD AC bonus and a high str (cappable at 48) I've elected to go two handed with a halberd (so one can keen weapon it), greatsword is good too, also any slashing one handed weapon ie scimitar longsword etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe most similar build is Mick Dagger's <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/spellsword-of-bahamut-sorc-26-paladin-4-rdd-10-t515415.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Spellsword of Bahamut</a>\u00a0which is a lovely build. Goes down Auto Still Route.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've elected to dump discipline, which many might criticise, my reasoning is around my understanding of how the mechanics of it works .\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one has a discipline score of say 45, and an AC of 50, and someone uses Improved Knockdown on you, and hits you with an attack roll of 52, you are going to get knocked down as your Discipline score of 45 will not exceed the attack roll of 52 +4 from improved knockdown<br/>\n<br/>\nKnockdown boots it will have to be, and pray there are no disarming enemies. If you meet them they might need to meet your bigby's hand (or name your spellcasting cheese)<br/>\n<br/>\nCant have everything as I have been taught (although I will certainly try!)<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a persistent world such as WoG with rest restrictions I would consider swapping Armor Skin for Craft Wand, plenty of AC should be given from RDD / Tumble 20 and Divine Shield / Full plate etc... but +2AC is still pretty sweet. Or Great Charisma for +1 to saves +1 to divine might damage +1 to divine shield AC and maybe a spell or two cast / day(like an extra magic missile cast) actually that is pretty good, also allow me to take EMA/EW earlier...<br/>\n<br/>\nOther Similar builds:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build300017.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dragonfire Warrior</a>\u00a0- Auto-Still III, Base AB 39, looks pretty good if you swap maximise spell for knockdown<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build181495.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">There is always another possibility</a>\u00a0- Dev Crit, Base AB 35<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build166519.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mick Dagger's Transcending Knight</a>\u00a0Sorc 20 / RDD 10 / Paladin 10<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build307193.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Arcane Blade of Draconic Might</a>\u00a0Base AB 40, looks pretty good if Knockdown is in the build (swap with improved crit)<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Sorcerer(26), Paladin(4), Red Dragon Disciple(10), Human\nSTR: 16 (36)\nCON: 14 (16)\nINT: 12 (14)\n\n01: Sorcerer(1): Still Spell, Power Attack\n03: Sorcerer(2): Weapon Focus: Halberd\n05: Paladin(2): {Smite Evil}\n07: Red Dragon Disciple(2): (STR=19)\n09: Red Dragon Disciple(4): Blind Fight, (STR=22)\n11: Red Dragon Disciple(6)\n13: Red Dragon Disciple(8)\n15: Paladin(3): Divine Might\n17: Sorcerer(4)\n19: Sorcerer(5)\n21: Sorcerer(7): Epic Weapon Focus: Halberd\n23: Sorcerer(9)\n25: Sorcerer(11)\n27: Sorcerer(13): Toughness\n29: Sorcerer(15)\n31: Sorcerer(17)\n33: Sorcerer(19): Armor Skin\n35: Sorcerer(21)\n37: Sorcerer(23): Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor\n39: Sorcerer(25): Great Strength III, (STR=35)\n\nSkillpoints: 198\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9\nAB (max, naked): 41 (melee), 24 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Sorcerer(9)\n\n\n01: Concentration(4), Lore(4), Open Lock(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n03: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Save(9),\u00a0\n05: Concentration(1), Lore(1), Save(13),\u00a0\n07: Concentration(1), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n09: Concentration(1), Search(3),\u00a0\n11: Concentration(1), Listen(3),\u00a0\n13: Concentration(1), Listen(1), Save(2),\u00a0\n15: Concentration(1), Save(8),\u00a0\n17: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(2), Save(11),\u00a0\n19: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(6), Save(13),\u00a0\n21: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(5), Save(9),\u00a0\n23: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(4), Save(9),\u00a0\n25: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(13),\u00a0\n27: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(5), Save(9),\u00a0\n29: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(2), Save(11),\u00a0\n31: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(17),\u00a0\n33: Concentration(1), Set Trap(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n35: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n37: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(5), Save(1),\u00a0\n39: Concentration(1), Set Trap(2), Spellcraft(1), Save(1),\u00a0</details>\n<strong>Edit</strong>: fixed up some formatting<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'm only thinking about changing ones like \"DC\" which could be either Devastating Critical or Difficulty Class as it stands, or the omission of any variety of SF - Spell Focus or Skill Focus. There are a few others that pop into my head, but I'll give it a proper look and consult the great and good for thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/nwn-acronyms-t515386.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NwN Acronyms</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then it would be nice if folk read it, of course...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hey thanks everyone for the feedback and particularly to ratty_uk2011 / stephenratcliffe809 for already playtesting it, must be a 'good egg' I have found (I understand that's a British /\u00a0sceptred isle slang term they use in Australia too). And thank you Stag for interjecting with some subtle Shakespeare! Wow what an education I am receiving!<br/>\n<br/>\nRe Dev Crit to incorporate it, one would have to find room for cleave, great cleave, improved critical, overwhelming critical and devastating critical which is a pretty tough ask. On WoG one could drop Still Spell, Blind Fight, Extend Spell, Armor Skin and Epic Prowess, change the weapon foci to Greatsword or Scimitar/Longsword, Base AB is still 40, Base Str is still 36, Dev Crit Difficulty Class [hehe <em>DC DC</em> -&gt; for Stag] 43 to 49. There's an item which can purge invisibility to remove? improved invisibility on opponents, or you can Mord them. Assassins and dexers with self-concealment might be a problem if you can't finger of death them.\u00a0 So Dev Crit is still pretty strong if put into the build<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way Dev Crit is considered overpowered by many hence I can understand why Ratty_Uk has attempted to be hush hush about it, kind of like 'he who shall not be named' (Lord V from Harry Potter)<br/>\n<br/>\nRE Naming I figured its a draft I know Valerfor is joking here but on a serious note naming can come later along with lore (naming and lore takes the longest for me when building heh) etc etc dragonic divine spell-halberd sounds cool I thought for a draft build at least<br/>\n<br/>\nRE Toughness I wanted this character to be both a spellsword and a good melee'er, buffs are dispellable until level 38+, I'm kind of trying to blindly follow Kail and Hip's formula I read in the ECB forum (300hp = support. 400hp = melee. 500hp = exclusive melee) and it nearly gets to 400hp. I took toughness Mid-Epic because the hit die at d4 for sorcerer and the bulk of the sorcerer levels are epic. Whereas pre-epic at least one gets d8/d10/d12 hit die to compensate with paladin/RDD levels. I could drop the HP down further for IKD or another feat like empower / great cha. These are all great choices depending on environment and equipment you have access to.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
