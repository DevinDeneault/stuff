I'll admit that I don't fully get the mechanics yet, but reckoned this might be a way to help me (and hopefully other newbs to the class) with your feedback.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, I had considered Monk, given that the UMD from Rogue was primarily for gear and those Sun Soul flip-flops and suchlike can be worn by Monk anyway. But then I thought about skill points and their absence, so Rogue got the vote. Maybe try Monk another time.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll go away and do it again, *sigh* - in a separate post, otherwise it'll all get too messy.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Just as an addendum to this, a little note about CoT that's easy to forget if you normally dump Charisma (as I do) and so only use CoT for bonus feats, saves, and maybe to avoid an xp pen with a melee class. It's also why it's worth losing being undispellable in this build for 15 levels of CoT.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might only be me, but just in case it's not, it's worth remembering that, with positive Cha, Divine Wrath (at levels 5, 10, 15, etc) is really nice to have on board. It gives an attack and damage bonus and penetrates DR (albeit not often) that gets better every 5th level. And - and I didn't know this until I started looking at Paladin - CoT levels also count towards the damage inflicted in Smite Evil, which is <strong>really</strong> nice when dealing with bosses.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I'm sure you lot all know this already, so I'll shut up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT:</strong></em> In the interests of honesty <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" />), I've just moved WF to level 3 from level 1 (replaced with Cleave), because a rogue can't focus in longsword and nor can it focus in anything with a BAB of 0.

All the builds there have charisma 8.<br/>\nMost are dexers. Many of the builds have rogue levels and are dual wielding halflings with epic dodge and trap skills. AB varies a bit between 43 for the human ones to 47 for the most AB focused halfling, a Paladin 20, CoT 10/ SD 10. The halfling paladin/rogues have AB between 44 and 46.<br/>\nThey have names like \"Holy agent\", \"Holy instigator\" and \"Holy commando\" <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\nSo why do I post this?
