If I add more pre-epic fighter levels I seem to lose level 9 wizard spells, so I've left it as it is<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Other F/W/PM builds:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nThere are 12 F/W/PM builds I can find in the archives. The closest to my build is\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build199699.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mithdradates's Soldier of Death</a>,\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build202355.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Grizzled_Dwarflord's Deathless Pariah</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build223351.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Deadmoney9951's Undead Spellsword</a>.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSoldier of Death has Devastating Critical but only up to level 6 wizard spells. Deathless Pariah and Undead Spellsword don't get Devastating Critical because they focus on getting Automatic Still Spell III (which I feel uncomfortable with, with only 10-18 caster levels and an attribute modifier of 4-5).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this could be a new build with the class combos, elven race etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Automatic Still Spell III is not required to cast Time Stop consistently in Full Plate:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nOne cool thing I learnt is that Time Stop has no somatic component, it is only verbal. That means that\u00a0<strong>Arcane Spell failure from armor doesn't apply</strong>. That means Automatic Still Spell III is not required to cast Time Stop in Full Plate (+ Tower), and I've tested this in game!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Time Stop / Devastating Critical combo:\u00a0</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I wish my high strength fighter could cast Time Stop in combat and land a nice Devastating Critical on a difficult opponent<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's a nice screenshot of my Spellblade doing that in the PGCC module with a Mundane Greatsword and Mundane Fullplate as the only items equipped:<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/201908/10759084_c68c785c8c8397033c5c65abf49a6131_t.jpg\"/><br/>\nWhat do you think?

You do not need so many detection stuff with TS around. <br/>\n<strong>d</strong>) Dont concern yourself too much with Auto Still 3, for WoG. Just use the FG's chain-shirt &amp; shield bracers &amp; you'll be (more than) fine. <br/>\n<strong>e</strong>) Get Dev Crit earlier, you can do it.<br/>\n<strong>st</strong>) IDS is nice but not so nice as Empower spell.<br/>\n<strong>f</strong>) See, if you can play an Illusionist for more spell-power.

      "content": "<div>Thanks Valerfor for the advice, pretty much everything you have written I agree with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have checked the bonus wizard feats and unfortunately I don't think I can take EMA with them. No matter though, EMA I feel unsure about, mostly because of this comment in the NWN Wiki:<br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Epic_mage_armor\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Epic_mage_armor</a> wrote:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nThis spell often has no effect other than the +5 dodge bonus, due to epic characters frequently possessing +5 or better equipment. However, a character who\u00a0polymorphs\u00a0after casting this spell usually benefits from the full +20 as item bonuses are lost during arcane polymorphs.</div></blockquote>\nSo I dropped it and 3 pale master levels for empower spell and extra caster levels (to help the buffs last longer). Also I discovered it allows me to cast two level 9 spells / day (meaning <strong>two, [</strong><strong>three? time stop casts / day</strong>\u00a0if I also specialise in illusionist?] as you wrote, instead of one cast / day) which I think is definitely worth dropping EMA, and a few rounds of duration on EW.<br/>\n<br/>\nGot <strong>Str 30,</strong> <strong>AB 40!!!!</strong>\u00a0(<strong>hooray!</strong>), devastating critical at level 30 (rather than 40!) and kept improved disarm too. Dropped epic weapon specialisation to get AB 40 from epic prowess, but I think I would prefer to make sure I hit them and critical them 5% more often, than do +4 damage per hit and hit them less.<br/>\n<br/>\nManaged to also keep improved disarm in the build, this guy is meant to be a mean killer and it could be situationally useful, particularly against enemies with tiny (daggers) or small weapons (short swords)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway its a dwarf now and I can't keep the same picture, so lets make a new build...\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span

Now give it lvl 9 arcane spellpower and epic spells...<br/>\n<br/>\n(OK, so the caster level is low with short duration and limited power of many spells. The spell penetration and spells DC are awful. But that is not important here, because your focus lies elsewhere.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBottom line: I like the build!<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: If you take Set trap, it is very convenient to have at least 1 point in disarm traps. Just so you can pick up (recover) traps you want to move to a better location, and any leftover traps that didn't go off during the fight. You always have automatic success when you recover your own traps, but you need the skill to be able to do it.</div>",

If I proceed with PM until W5/PM3, the lv 3 slots become 2, plus a lv 4 spell slot.<br/>\nIf I do not have scrolls at my disposal, the only thing to be done is to level up as a wiz at 9 level: that way, I can select both lv 4 spells and lv 3 spells that I should have acquired if I had previously leveled up as a wiz instead of a PM.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan you confirm?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same, I think, applies to sorcerers. This should clear why the latest illusionist levels are chosen after the PM ones.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Orion, I'm thinking (now that I had a couple of coffees at last) that you don't really lose anything by stoping PM progression at 12th-level (Ch. level-thirty) &amp; taking asap the rest of wizard levels in order to get empower spell at 34th-level instead of 39th, right? The reasoning for this are some especially annoying melee enemies that might need gms/igms &amp; then empowered gms/igms (double the firepower, essentially). Then you continue with the rest of the PM levels as planned, leaving last your fighter level &amp; epic prowess. Now, you do delay the epic warding a bit, but this still should be a better trade overall.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Aquarius you are very insightful and correct.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nPale Master doesn't learn any new spells, only gets access to the spell slots of a higher level, so those extra spells slots will need to be learned through scrolls.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI took the Wizard levels at the end to get Epic Warding ASAP. A side effect was to also obtain Time Stop/Mords for free without relying on finding a Time Stop or Mord's Scroll.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI haven't had a single Time Stop or Mord's scroll drop during my playthrough as Druid to level 40 on WoG, so I wanted to guarantee access to both spells when this character hits level 38, by taking those last levels of Wizard late and making sure the character has a base intelligence of 19 (hence the Great Intelligence feat taken at Wizard 5 rather than Empower Spell) when those levels are taken.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's just a bias I have, to reduce reliance on the environment for a critical power spike. Both Time Stop and Mord's are verbal only spells without somatic components, so they both should be able to be cast in full plate (I have tested Time Stop, haven't tested Mord's yet).<br/>\n<br/>\nI take Valerfor's point though.\u00a0In an environment where Time Stop and Mord scrolls are accessible I would definitely swap the Great Int and Empower Spell bonus wizard feats around. Originally I made the build that way but swapped them around to secure those spells without relying on the environment. That way Epic Warding stays where it is and Empowered ILMS and IGMS can be cast, if necessary, (or Empowered Bulls Strength / Endurance / Cat's Grace etc )</div>"
