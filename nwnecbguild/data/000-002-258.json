So on 20th level I get him to Dex 23, I give him the Greater Dexterity feat on level 21 to get him to Dex 24 and by level 24 I can get him to Dex 25 so no problem there. <br/>\n<br/>\nI have been adding to tumble on every level to get to 30 ranks. I already have improved evasion from the monk levels and the fifth level of Shadowdancer gets him the defensive roll feat necessary for Epic Dodge. <br/>\n<br/>\n So, I'm testing this all out and on the 24th level I give him his 5th Shadowdancer level, I give him Dex 25 and.... when I get to feat selection Epic Dodge is not available!!! <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat am I doing wrong??? Do I have to have tumble at 30 UNMODIFIED ranks for the feat? And thus won't be able to get Epic Dodge until level 27???<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
