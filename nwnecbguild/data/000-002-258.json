      "content": "<div>I'm sure the veterans here settled this question ages ago, but I'm experimenting/comparing Warrior/WM/XX (non-mage) and Warrior/BG/XX (non-mage) builds with BRD/RDD/PM builds and I invariably end up with the Warrior build having 4-ish more AB and an extra attack (at -15) than the BRD/RDD/PM, but the Bard/RDD/PM will have 12-15 more AC, immunities up the yin-yang and all sorts of self buffs to negate much of the AB difference, plus an assortment of useful spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, assuming a Warrior build with an (unbuffed/mundane weapon) of 42/37/32/27 and a BRD/RDD/PM build with an (unbuffed/mundane weapon) AB of 38/33/28 and Bard Song/Curse Song making it virtually even with the FTR build, is the 4th attack at 27 worth more than the boatload of extra stuff you get from the BRD/RDD/PM?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd like to hear perspectives with respect to solo play, party play and PvP.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know most likely you'll get more HP (40-80) with the FTR build and better Fort saves, plus more feats.  If you go Paladin you'll add some decent spells and Ranger gives TWF/ITWF (at the cost of AC).  But with immunities to fire, critical hits, paralysis, sleep, etc., plus AC, full Tumble, full Spellcraft, it's a tough choce and (I assume) largely dependent on taste.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hitting and dealing damage is important, and to be able to hit you will need a good AB. AB is one of the main concerns when powerbuilding.<br/>\nBut AC, saves, skills, feats and immunities etc are also important.<br/>\nThere is no simple answer to your question, and that is one of the challenges you face when building: How to make a power build? It is quite common to combine different classes to get contributions from different worlds.<br/>\nNo single character will be brilliant at everything. You have to pick a focus, or something you want your character to do well.<br/>\nPlain warrior builds are generally better in settings where you can get potions and equipment that grant extra AC and other buffs and immunities. Caster classes tend to be stronger in low/mid magic settings.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 3/4 BAB classes have features that compensates well for the loss of AB. Cleric/bard/rdd characters can easily be among the strongest builds. The same goes for druid builds with dragon shape. Adding monk and/or ITWF are ways to compensate for lower # of attacks based on BAB. <br/>\nA high str (or dex) will improve AB. Several spells improve AB. Haste gives an extra attack. Divine Power improves AB and can give an extra attack.<br/>\nMy answer will probably not make things easier for you, but I hope it helps some.</div>",

      "content": "<div>Well a lot of it is really dependent on specifics - of both world and builds.  For example, your warrior/WM builds seem to be short a few AB points - 42 isn't what I'd consider at all acceptable in that kind of build, considering a straight human warrior with 18 starting attack stat that takes all full BAB pre-epic along with WF, EWF, EP, and 6 Great X feats will have an AB of 46 and still has plenty of epic levels to muck around with bard, rogue, etc levels.  So in that case comparing a 38 AB with +2 song and -5 AC curse song puts things about even.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, bard builds are for me also world (and rest restriction) dependent) - e.g. if your going for 20 Bard and 10/10 PM/RDD and taking lasting inspiration for 100 round songs, no problem.  But if it's something less than 20 bard, then it really depends how much you need both Bard and Curse song for each encounter.  If so, that's only 8 spawn groups before you're out of songs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpecifically on the 4th attack, it really depends on the server and various Monster AC's vs your AB-15 4th attack and how often it hits.  On the server I primarily play, there are very few monsters that a good AB build will need a 19-20 to hit with the 4th attack (at least for my PG builds), so often even on the 4th attack im hitting down with rolls like 13 or 14.  Additionally there is a lot of immunity gear available, so for me in that environment, I wouldn't consider a melee PC without a 4th attack, but mostly bc I don't want a BAB of 25 and constantly have to make up the AB difference.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hello, mate!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe answer to your question is yes and no, Theo.<br/>\n<br/>\nObviously in terms of RAW AB you'll be at least 5 points behind (depending on your starting abilities maybe more, because you'll need CHA 16 to cast bard spells, which can mean potentially less starting STR than a warrior, but not necessarily), however, you have your BARDNESS to help out. But that also depends on the kinds of items that are available to the warriors you are talking about.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe magical enhancement cap to AB is +20, meaning you can't MAGICALLY increase your AB by more than that, however you can indirectly increase it by Taunting and Curse-singing (which doesn't count as a magical enhancement, so it's \"extra\" bonuses, since you're technically reducing enemy AC, not increasing your AB), but that's assuming the opponents will fail Concentration checks, which is not necessarily true, or that they don't have a potion of Lesser Restoration to be rid of the Curse Song effects, which a good Fighter should always have. So these are situational and shouldn't be counted as \"all-the-time AB enhancements\". So you have GMW (+5) which is negated if the warriors in question have access to +5 or better weapons, your Bard Song, which gives +2 AB and +5 AC (so -5 chances of the enemy hitting you, or in other words, indirectly -5 enemy AB, but the bonus is Dodge and lost while flat-footed). There is also ability enhancement, which can add up to +6 and you can buff better than a fighter, but depending on the items, again, not necessarily an advantage.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you see there are many variables to take into account, so I cannot say that you WILL be within the 1 or 2 range from warriors the way you wish to be, but I can say it's possible. The lower the magic level, the better it is for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake a look at this build of mine, it seems to be exactly what you're looking for:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.44.forumer.com/the-cursed-half-dragon-chanter-bard-20-rdd-10-pm-10-t2330742.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Cursed Half-dragon Chanter</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"
