      "content": "<div>Welcome Ges! <br/>\n I have some questions to help us help you.<br/>\n When you say level cap <em>mid 20s</em>, is that 25 or is it something else?<br/>\n You seem a bit udecided on what you want from the 3 classes you listed and also on what you want with your build: Exotic weapon, dual wield, bard song, curse song, divine might, divine wrath, cleric spells, bard spells, offensive bard spells, healing domain (good/ strength/protection/healing)... You can't have all that in a build, especially not with mid 20s levels. Then you seem to narrow it down somewhat to bard song/curse song, divine might, divine wrath, but it is still hard to make an effective build, so please come up with your idea of what this character is going to be, and let us help you with the mechanics.</div>",

Hope this helps narrow things down better<br/>\n<br/>\n -max lv 26<br/>\n -bard and cot only (with bard focus, able to cast bard 6th level spells), not to sure how well divine might cleric works since i never used it before so ill go with divine wrath cot<br/>\n -martial weapon proficiency (weapon focus greatsword), four attacks per turn<br/>\n<br/>\n open to choices for spells and feats, but basically want him to be decent melee and still have that safety net of spells. (he's for a low magic level campaign (items are no more than +3 bonuses unless cast upon</div>"

      "content": "<div>OK have a look at this one. It is a strength based character for full plate and greatsword. I have given the character 19 bard levels since you wanted the spells. With full plate you will need to cast them stilled, or undress for your long term buffs. The character has 4 attacks (5 with haste) and an unbuffed AB of 28. Can boost AB With Divine wrath (+3), GMW (+5), Song (+2), Curse song (+5), Taunt (+6), War cry (+2), Bull's (+1-2). Base AC With a 2-hander is 25 and can be boosted with Expertise (+5), Cat's (+1), song (+5), curse song (+2), Haste (+4), Mage armor (+1-4).<br/>\n<br/>\n Bard(19), Champion of Torm(6), Fighter(1), Human<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 16 (20)<br/>\n DEX: 10<br/>\n CON: 14<br/>\n WIS: 8<br/>\n INT: 14<br/>\n CHA: 14 (16)<br/>\n<br/>\n Human: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n 01: Bard(1): Expertise, Power Attack<br/>\n 02: Fighter(1): Cleave<br/>\n 03: Bard(2): Curse Song<br/>\n 04: Bard(3): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n 05: Bard(4)<br/>\n 06: Bard(5): Weapon Focus: Greatsword<br/>\n 07: Bard(6)<br/>\n 08: Bard(7): STR+1, (STR=18)<br/>\n 09: Bard(8): Knockdown<br/>\n 10: Champion of Torm(1)<br/>\n 11: Champion of Torm(2): Blind Fight<br/>\n 12: Bard(9): STR+1, Lingering Song, (STR=19)<br/>\n 13: Champion of Torm(3): {Smite Evil}<br/>\n 14: Champion of Torm(4): Improved Knockdown<br/>\n 15: Champion of Torm(5): Still Spell<br/>\n 16: Bard(10): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n 17: Bard(11)<br/>\n 18: Bard(12): Toughness<br/>\n 19: Bard(13)<br/>\n 20: Bard(14): CHA+1, (CHA=15)<br/>\n 21: Champion of Torm(6): Epic Weapon Focus: Greatsword, Armor Skin<br/>\n 22: Bard(15)<br/>\n 23: Bard(16)<br/>\n 24: Bard(17): CHA+1, Epic Prowess, (CHA=16)<br/>\n 25: Bard(18)<br/>\n 26: Bard(19)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Hitpoints: 262<br/>\n Skillpoints: 189<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 18/15/19<br/>\n Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +6<br/>\n BAB: 19<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 28 (melee), 20 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 17/28<br/>\n Spell Casting: Bard(6)<br/>\n Alignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\n Discipline 29(34), Listen 22(21), Perform 27(30), Spellcraft 28(30), Taunt 29(32), Tumble 25(25), UMD 29(32)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Discipline(4), Listen(4), Perform(1), Spellcraft(3), Taunt(4), UMD(4), Save(8),<br/>\n 02: Discipline(1), Save(12),<br/>\n 03: Discipline(1), Listen(2), Perform(3), Taunt(2), Tumble(5), UMD(2), Save(4),<br/>\n 04: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(3), Taunt(1), UMD(1), Save(4),<br/>\n 05: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(5), Taunt(1), UMD(1), Save(2),<br/>\n 06: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Taunt(1), UMD(1), Save(5),<br/>\n 07: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(3), Taunt(1), Tumble(5), UMD(1),<br/>\n 08: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Taunt(1), UMD(1), Save(3),<br/>\n 09: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(2), Taunt(1), UMD(1), Save(4),<br/>\n 10: Discipline(1), Save(8),<br/>\n 11: Discipline(1), Save(12),<br/>\n 12: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Perform(1), Spellcraft(5), Taunt(3), Tumble(5), UMD(3),<br/>\n 13: Discipline(1), Save(4),<br/>\n 14: Discipline(1), Save(8),<br/>\n 15: Discipline(1), Save(12),<br/>\n 16: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(5), Taunt(4), UMD(4), Save(4),<br/>\n 17: Discipline(1), Perform(3), Taunt(1), Tumble(5), UMD(1),<br/>\n 18: Discipline(1), Listen(2), Taunt(1), UMD(1), Save(2),<br/>\n 19: Discipline(1), Taunt(1), UMD(1), Save(6),<br/>\n 20: Discipline(1), Perform(3), Spellcraft(5), Taunt(1), UMD(1), Save(2),<br/>\n 21: Discipline(1), Save(6),<br/>\n 22: Discipline(1), Perform(3), Taunt(2), Tumble(5), UMD(2),<br/>\n 23: Discipline(1), Perform(4), Taunt(1), UMD(1),<br/>\n 24: Discipline(1), Listen(2), Perform(1), Taunt(1), UMD(1), Save(1),<br/>\n 25: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(5), Taunt(1), UMD(1),<br/>\n 26: Discipline(1), Listen(4), Taunt(1), UMD(1),</div>",

      "content": "<div>Concentration serves two purposes that I can think of atm. For spellcasters it protects your spellcasting from being disrupted when someone damages you. It also helps defend against taunting attempts.<br/>\n I have not put anything in concentration here, so you risk being disrupted if you cast spells in the heat of battle. The reason why I have ignored it is that this character is a fairly strong mele- fighter even without the spells and will most often buff up before battle with the most important spells. If you are caught unaware, or dispelled, your songs will be your best quick-buffs, and they will not be interrupted. <br/>\n But, by all means, it is not wrong to build up concentration, but here I have given other skills priority.<br/>\n<br/>\n Breastplate and chainmail give less AC than full plate. Full plate gives 8 + 1 from dexterity if dex is 12 or better. Breastpalte and chainmail give maximum 5 + 2 from dexterity if your dex is 14 or better. Medium armor has slightly less arcane spell failure than heavy armor, but still high enough to make your spellcasting unreliable if you drop still spell. Unless there is a specific \"uber\" medium armor that you want to make a build for, I recommend full plate for strength based bards.</div>",
