The normal 1.5 * base speed cap to movement speed is overridden by monk speed (at monk 3) and stacking of speed bonuses occur as follows: Initial Speed = 1.00(base speed) + 0.1(monk bonus) = 1.10.  Cast Mass Haste for 1.5 * Initial Speed + 0.1(monk bonus) = 1.5 * 1.1 + 0.1 = 1.75.  Cast expeditious retreat for 1.5 * Mass Haste Speed + 0.1(monk bonus) = 1.5 * 1.75 + 0.1 = 2.725. That speed can outrun any natural monk (monk 39 moves at 2.30), giving the sorcerer a huge edge in casting and running without getting caught.  If both spells are extended you can have 7 full turns at this fantastic speed, which is probably enough time to allow you to unleash your spell arsenal.<br/>\nWhat does fast speed give?  <br/>\n\tImproved herding skills.  See that mob of scattered melee enemies all moving the same speed? Simply circle around the mob again and again and watch it cluster together.  When it becomes a compact group unleash your area of effect spells.  (Oh, and since your hasted you cast in half the usual time, so while herding you can still cast spells without being attacked).<br/>\n\tRun past your enemies to the advantageous terrain.  See that cliff? The way up is far away but you can make it there and run back on top of the cliff, leaving your enemies unable to determine which way to go to reach you.<br/>\n\tAvoid the bosses.   Those nasty monsters that can dish out hundreds of damage with their smite (or whatever power) seem a lot less threatening if they cannot attack before collapsing.<br/>\nHuman, Lawful Good<br/>\nPvM/PvP 1-40 (Does especially well in low to medium magic environments)<br/>\nStrength 10<br/>\nDexterity 8<br/>\nConstitution 14<br/>\nWisdom 8<br/>\nIntelligence 14<br/>\nCharisma 18 (38)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 298(max roll), 227.5(average roll)<br/>\nSkillpoints: 227<br/>\nSaving throws: Fortitude 36, Reflex 31, Will 36<br/>\nBAB: 20<br/>\nAB: 22/17 (naked, unbuffed) <br/>\nAC: 17 (naked, unbuffed)<br/>\n<br/>\nSkills:<br/>\nConcentration 43 (45)<br/>\nDiscipline 42 (42)<br/>\nLore 17 (19)<br/>\nPersuade 42 (56)<br/>\nSpellcraft 43 (45)<br/>\nTumble 40 (39)<br/>\n<br/>\n1.

If so, is there a cap?</div></blockquote>\n\nHere's the full description, the formative parts of which can be found in the talk page of the monk article at the NWN wiki.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk speed is an additive bonus reflecting a percentage of the base speed (normal speed with or without encumbrance, stealth/detect mode, running/walking).<br/>\nSpeed increases and decreases (as can be found with haste, slow, and expeditious retreat) are multiplicative bonuses that base their increase/decrease on the current speed.<br/>\n--<br/>\nWhen a speed increase/decrease is added a recursive formulation follows multiplying first and then re-adding the monk bonus.<br/>\nWhen a speed increase/decrease is removed then the speed is recalculated multiplying first and then adding the monk bonus once thereafter.<br/>\n--<br/>\nThe spells haste, expeditious retreat, and blinding speed try to be mutual exclusive, thus their scripts do not allow for stacking.<br/>\n--<br/>\nThe cap for one with monk speed is (3.0 + monk speed bonus) * base speed.  Without monk speed the cap is 1.5 * base speed.<br/>\n<br/>\n--<br/>\n--<br/>\nThus for direct answers.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPerma-haste does stack with expeditious (though without monk speed either of the two already reaches the cap).  Just remember to unequip and reequip the perma-haste item whenever you lose a speed affecting effect (this causes the monk speed to be considered multiple times).<br/>\n<br/>\nA monk 6 build with mass haste and expeditious retreat has pretty much reached full potential ((1.2 * 1.5) + 0.2) * 1.5 + 0.2) = 3.2 which is the cap (3.0 + 0.2) for a level 6 monk.  After that every three monk levels only increases the speed by 0.1 because of the cap.  Though every 3 levels of monk means 6 less rounds of extended expeditious retreat and extended mass haste.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The monk lvl is better at 17 and get 20 tumble for +1 AC while levelling, imho. Is there a reason you have gone for listen? You shouldn't need to be afraid of sneaks, but that depends on spell choice too I guess. Similarly, if you don't want persuade, and listen could be superfluous, you could drop the starting INT by 2. You don't have any feats needing INT13. It'd get you +1AC if put into DEX and with this character you aren't going to get caught flat footed and lose it. Although having said that, discipline is not required either. There's a potential 4 starting attribute points to be played with? <br/>\n<br/>\nS35/M4/P1 gives you the same bonus sorc feats, but it'd mean you'd be able to make another tumble dump and get your speed boost as early as lvl 21 (well, 23 to get all your 9th lvl spells) which would make it more playable until lvl 40. Just a thought. <br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I only have minor tweaks to suggest for your take on this:<br/>\nMy personal preference would be to take Silent spell as well for all those spells you want to cast from one slot higher, that cannot be extended. I would drop Greater penetration for that. <br/>\nIf you have too many skills, and I think you do, you can always drop Intelligence to 10 and start with Constitution 16 for better hitpoints.<br/>\nIf you really plan on running, AC is not that important, and Tumble can stop at 15, just enough to avoid attacks of opportunity.<br/>\nIf the True seeing spell works normally, listen is a good skill to supplement it with. If the TS spell is nerfed to only add a bonus to Spot, I would take the Spot skill and improve it with the spell.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

However, before then, you have enough lvl2 and 3 spell slots to keep see invisibility up all day long if you are worried about sneaks attacking you outside of combat. In combat you will have see invis and ultravision or true seeing up anyway. So I'd say it's mostly superfluous, environment dependent. (Blind fight is only useful if you want to try to hit something (afaik) and this character is running from melee.). However, those extra 2 points of starting stats are less easy to fill in somewhere useful. Now we have dropped discipline it may not help anyway. (I'll need to look again at a not ridiculously late hour, *grin*)<br/>\n<br/>\nFair enough Darktooth. The 4th monk only makes it earlier for the speed boost really. If it's for a PW its purely down to choice ofc but I always think it's a shame to have to play it as a pure sorc/whatever until lvl37+. (I know that's not the point of this guild, but I think it's worth a mention) Having played a few speedy sorceressesesses (What? it's a hard word to stop spelling!) It's the lvl15+ to UntilYouGetEpicSpells that it really shines, so I'd go for 17 to get the speed boost. 12 to get the magic tumble number 15, and 7 as the first. your spell pen feats will cover the shortfall and you only lose 1 caster lvl. But that's all levelling thought, not the final character. Oh! If you have decuided to drop discipline then the final monk can be 37 now, not 39. it's only for tumble now, no?<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Constitution is not a major priority, that is Charisma, but it adds\u00a0 to the hit point pool and makes life a little bit easier. It doesn't hurt with a slightly better fort save either. An empowered Endurance also gives a good boost.<br/>\nA permahaste item and Expeditious retreat should do the trick and get you running like mad, and give you that extra action per round that Haste provides. You can stack several castings of Expeditious retreat for more speed if you feel you need it.<br/>\nNormally I prefer Listen over Spot, except for my snipers and sneakers, where I want the hidden targets to appear in the line of sight. The TS spell will normally make things visible for a Sorcerer.<br/>\nPicking spells is important and sometimes challenging. You want to be able to handle different challenges, and the spells you pick will also reflect your spell focus and your preferred tactics. What low level spells to pick also depends on your character level. When you first get level 3 spells, Fireball is very strong. Later in the game you rather want Flame arrow because it becomes a much better spell.<br/>\nAs for spell changes, I recommend that you read the web pages of the PW you want to try. The spell changes are often announced somewhere in the Forum pages together with other custom changes.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Yip the extra starting points are better in CON. +1 CON on an item and s/he can survive two maxed IGMS now.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnto the edit: Well if TS is nerfed I'd go back to ultra and see invis and drop Bull's Strength and Melf's arrow. I like Melf's while levelling as at times it can break enemy caster concentration, but it's less likely at lvl40. I'd also drop something from lvl4 (ILMS probably, you have 3 levels worth of IGMS as it is) for improved invisibility as it gives better concealment than Displacement for longer. So now there's a lvl3 slot open. I wouldn't worry about filling it right now tho. It's good to have slots free that you can fill depending on environment. Something like Stinking Cloud might work well to herd and keep them in one place while you Horrid Wilt them or to irritate enemy archers.\u00a0 I'd like to see Lesser Spell Mantle at lvl5 as it will stack with Spell Mantle and covers you while recasting both mantles when they start to fail. (You will see one fail and at that point I finish my current spell and then recast both mantles because you know the next incoming spell will bring down the 2nd mantle.) I'd drop Bigby's Interposing probably. You still have a bigby available and interposing is the least useful of all of them.

The list of spells in my first post almost reflects the order that the spells were selected, with a few switches that I will attempt to detail:<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nFireball is acquired as soon as it becomes attainable.<br/>\nILMS is selected after Evard\u2019s and Ice Storm, but is discarded at the time when IGMS is picked up.<br/>\nWhen \u00a0a lvl 7 spell slot becomes available, Fireball is ditched for Flame Arrow.\u00a0<br/>\nBigby 7, 8 and 9 are acquired, with higher level spell replacing the former, but Bigby 6 is retained<br/>\nAnother third lvl 7 spell is selected (e.g Mordenkainen\u2019s Sword) before changing it to Spell Mantle once the later can be empowered.<br/>\nUpon getting Mordenkainen\u2019s Disjunction, Greater Spell Breach is replaced by True Seeing, which in turn is later swapped for Mass Haste (preferably upon reaching lvl 38 of the build, or soon after gaining equipment with True Seeing property, whichever you choose.)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nFurther suggestions are welcome.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Depends on the environment / equipment / personal preference which is optimal for the player.<br/>\nI like darktooth's spell list!\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of spells for PvM I would add:<br/>\n- Grease at level 1, if I have access to knockdown immunity<br/>\n- Darkness and (empowered) endurance at level 2<br/>\n- Stinking cloud and prot v elements at level 3<br/>\n- Mestil's Acid Sheath at level 5<br/>\n- Bigby's 7 at level 7 for knockdown immune meleers (who Bigby's 6 won't work on)<br/>\n<br/>\nDropping Negative energy burst, Invisibility, Negative energy burst, displacement, Energy buffer and spell mantle.<br/>\n<br/>\nTrue seeing would be nice too but extended mass haste is needed to get the most out of the speed caster, can sometimes come from items (Gem of Seeing).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAll personal preference of course! I like to spam a few AoE crowd control spells as well. Those archers can't shoot me, if they can't see through the darkness! :) And I can stand in the stinky cloud if I cast prot v good on myself! :) Oh and an extended 72 round CL 36 (1d6+72 acid / hit) Mestil's Acid Sheath! Wow! Although with all the toys at one's disposal, so many of the features never get used!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of the monk levels, I would get Sorc 20 then rush Monk 1-2-3. In the dispel/mord spamming environment that Web and I torture ourselves in (WoG), even getting Sorc 24 before the first Monk level might be attractive. Getting those faster higher sorc levels makes playing easier I've found than getting monk stuff, when I've played a sorc/speed caster myself. I can understand the late monk level however to try to near max listen, but its nice to get the features earlier rather than later.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Every tile in an area is exactly 10m x 10m, if you run horizontally/vertically across 10 tiles then you will move a distance of 100m. At each end of a 100m track I put two triggers, one that starts a timer script when entered and one that ends the timer script when entered. Timing is done automatically in-game using this script, so as long as I don't pause the game (which can mess with in-game time) it should be accurate. I use scripting to align the direction of each character, so none of them run at a different angle which could change the distance between the triggers. The only thing I do in all of these tests is press \"W\" which is fairly hard to mess up. I add effects and item properties using chat commands, so I can test everything I need to with any character.<br/>\n<br/>\nEMSD(x) is EffectMovementSpeedDecrease(x), with -9999 &lt;= x &lt;= 99. There's probably no lower bound, but my chat commands only go as low as -9999 without alterations. A negative EMSD effect increases movement speed,<br/>\nEMSI(x) is EffectMovementSpeedIncrease(x). with -9999 &lt;= x &lt;= 99999. There are probably no bounds, but my chat commands only handle -9999 to 99999 without alterations. A negative EMSI effect decreases movement speed. EMSI(100) to EMSI(199) is equivalent to EMSI(0) to EMSI(99).<br/>\nNeither EMSD(0) nor EMSI(0) should affect movement speed, but for builds with Monk Speed they actually increase movement speed.<br/>\n<br/>\nEHaste + EMSI(50) =\u00a0EHaste + EMSI(150) = Expeditious Retreat + Blinding Speed / Haste (spell) / Mass Haste.<br/>\nIHaste + EMSI(50) = IHaste + EMSI(150) = Expeditious Retreat + Haste (item property).<br/>\nSo there is a difference between item property Haste and effect Haste when it comes to stacking with Monk Speed.<br/>\n<br/>\nVanilla speed increasing effects<br/>\nRallying Cry applies an EMSI(20) effect to the target, a 20% speed increase.<br/>\nExpeditious Retreat applies an EMSI(150) effect to the target which is equivalent to an EMSI(50) effect, a 50% speed increase.<br/>\nBlinding Speed, Haste (spell), and Mass Haste apply a haste effect to the target.<br/>\nHaste (item property) also applies haste to the target, but based on the tests it stacks differently compared to a haste effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: I've uploaded the test module on github.
