A type that specializes in above average attack rolls, High Damage Crits, natural immunities, high AC, high saving throws, above average spell/elemental resistances and damage reduction. <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Purpose:</strong> Notice that the Character build was built in congruence to specific equipment in the game. Since, optimization is the goal, I usually use this approach in every character I build for every RPG game: Build the character to make optimal use of your planned end-game (lvl 40) items. I am open to comments and suggestions for the sake of improving the concept. I'm striving for optimization, so for the more calculation-savy people  who will notice flaws in the build, please do make it known, so I can fix it in my future attempts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Backstory:</strong> (will be added, once I get the inspiration to write one)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Race:</strong> Human<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Alignment:</strong> Lawful/Good<br/>\n<br/>\nPvM  Easily Playable (1-40), Untested PvP<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Class:</strong> Paladin (5), Monk (20), Champion of Torm (15)<br/>\n<br/>\nInitial Stats: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Stats @40 w/o Feats &amp; Equipment\t\t<br/>\nStr-15 ------------------------------------------------  Str-20 (+5)<br/>\nDex-9 ------------------------------------------------- Dex-9 (-9)<br/>\nCon-16 ----------------------------------------------- Con-20 (+5)<br/>\nWis-12 ----------------------------------------------- Wis-12 (+1)<br/>\nInt-10 ------------------------------------------------- Int-10 (0)<br/>\nCha-13 ----------------------------------------------- Cha-14 (+2)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Level Progression:</strong><br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:85%;line-height:normal\"><strong>BOLD</strong> - feat necessary to the Concept Build<br/>\n*** -low level utility feat<br/>\n**- feat taken to fulfill roleplaying aesthetics<br/>\n* - feat was taken due to the lack of better choices<br/>\nFeats listed before &gt;&gt; are those gained through leveling in a certain profession.<br/>\nFeats listed after &gt;&gt; are those \"purchased\" upon level up.</span><br/>\n<br/>\n1 - Paladin -<strong> Divine Grace, Divine Health, Shield Proficiency**</strong>, L/M/<strong>H.

(brain-dead gameplay)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Q&amp;A -</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nQ#1 - Why not pick a Paladin/Cleric/CoT instead, if you were aiming for some kind of legit God-mode?<br/>\n<br/>\nA#1 - First of all, Cleric gameplay doesn't really fit my idea of a Knight. While the bonuses achieved with an empowered/maximized/extended - Greater Stoneskin/Bull's Strength/Eagle's Splendor/Premonition/Spell Mantle surpasses what was achieved in what I just wrote...ten-fold... It'll eventually wear off, meaning you'll have to recast it over and over again throughout your entire gameplay. It's not a matter of being lazy, it's more about following the role-playing principle. The concept of the build is a natural tank (80-90% of AC,ST and Damage come from just \"being you\") rather than a spellsword, who uses a lot of buffs to achieve the max break points. <br/>\nWith the Divine Templar you can just walk around and beating things, laughing @ the game, randomly casting that occasional DivM/DivS/DivW if you really want. Engage a mob, fall asleep for 8 hours, and with much luck... you'll probably still see you character alive and well when you wake up.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSuggestions... now open!!!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">@ mick dagger: <br/>\nsorry, the \"end-stats\" were calculated w/o the effect of the equipment and feats taken... meaning i only calculated the attribute points I added (the one you get every 4 levels). As I've only added \"5\" it comes out as \"20.\" but like you said I also purchased the feats Great Strength I-V. so that would make my raw STR - 25 enabling me to get the Devastating Crit Feat.<br/>\n<br/>\n@empyre 65:<br/>\nim quite aware that other Pala/CoT/xxx combinations will gain me more end-game BA. But the I didn't really make the build with optimization of stats in mind. What I was after was the optimization of a certain concept. That being a tank-type \"Holy Warrior\" with access to \"Devatating Crits\" w/ immunities w/o sacrificing equipment slots to get them. TBH this is a work in progress... and I'm considering making it a 13 pala/11 monk/16 CoT instead and ending with Str-20, Dex-13, Con-15, Wis-11, Cha-16, which still preserves the intended concept except with higher BA, possibly a higher AC due to equipment flexibility, +1 increase in Cha modifier, and access to Dodge and Mobility instead of the frivolous feats taken like Epic Toughness I and Extra Turning. I'm currently levelling my 2nd version of this toon now. But the paper stat improvement looks promising.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Why not go DEX-Based Kama or unarmed and have a better attack progression that deals Divine Favor damage 7 times per round? It's certainly more appropriate than this, not to mention the speed bonus, which is what makes high-level Monks attractive. Think about it, at least, And try to optimize the spread to 5 / 20 / 15 is not good. You can go Pal 5 Monk 25 CoT 10 and be better, or Pal 6 Monk 20 CoT 14. In short, there are much better spreads to consider. Personally, I would consider, if going for Kama, Pal 17 Monk 9 CoT 14, or Monk 12 CoT 10 Pal 18. You get most of your spell slots on lvls 15-20, and pally spells are good.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Firstly, welcome to the ECB, and congratulations on your first post. A brave step, and glad you took it. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, and without coming down hard on you, it's important when posting to set out your character without equipment, i.e., just the naked stats, adding in what it is that your character can on its own do (i.e., buffs and things you actually own, not what you get or rather hope to get in terms of gear, as gear does not count). Now, I know you are building around a concept--namely, a holy avenger (item), and that's cool, however, the classes that you've chosen don't get the synnergies you are hoping for, so far as monk as a class loses its \"goodness\" when wearing armor or wielding a weapon (other than monk fist or kama), and 5 pal makes no sense, especially when mid level of it gets you the good paladin book, including Holy Sword (so no reason to hunt something down, yes?). <br/>\n20 Monk/15-16 Pal/4-5 COT (Fighter would be better than CoT for WS/EWS, but would come with XP burden and if you're like me, unless building level 40 only, no one much likes XP burden, as they're no fun and thus to be avoided at all costs, so understand why in turn you took CoT as that makes sense). Another option would be more CoT and 15-20 Pal, less Monk with which I agree. This, unless you're looking to take on some mages maybe, in which case, MORE MONK! <br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words, I echo much of what has been said above (there is some good advice there for you to consider) and to which I add the following information/tutorial as to why for your benefit and that of other new members, and possibly some older ones as well who have recently returned to NWN and coming up to speed on changes made in light of the most recent patch. Those who already know all this feel free to do something else, but information I believe is good for it's own sake. But as I particularly and especially enjoy the Paladin class, having written guides and so forth about the class in past, with a fondness for monks as well (sorry, Master Dinn, wherever you may be these days, if only you were here to further refine and discuss your \"favourite\" monk class!), just throwing some information out there for you to consider, and maybe help you make sense of why it is that folks here including myself are suggesting some changes for you so as to make your Divine Templar even better, yes? OK, and at the risk of putting others here to sleep, here goes: <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Holy Sword--Mechanics (Pre and Post patch):</strong> <br/>\nPaladin Holy Sword -- 4th level paladin spell (for which you need more paladin) which used to be awesome; cast on weapon for +5 AB, +5 damage and +1d6 divine v. evil as above said, and which pre-1.69 was not capped, having a flat 25% chance of dispelling everything \"on hit\" needing to do but a single point of physical damage to fire, and that's it (better than Mord's, but now it's capped). Prior to the patch, 15 pal levels was all that was needed to make that work right and even though (PvP) 15 pal could be dispelled, the holy sword itself could not. With monk speed and other boni the monk had (including high monk AC vs. bigby's etc.) a 20 monk with 15+ Paladin for the holy sword and other great Paladin buffs (which are nice, not to mention immunities thus synnergies also with a high level monk) made for a good solid melee combatant and had a \"shot\" at mages, especially those dex-based so as to full train stealth with a nice reflex (bolstered by improved evasion) such that a mage cannot get much off so far as a high monk with speed and high AC closes the gap rather quickly, with IKD among other things to deliver to the opponent once said monk gets there, even if dispelled (that was the beauty of the old Holy Sword but alas, that sword is nerfed so doesn't work like that anymore). <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Focus on what it is you are after with the monk: well rounded combat (melee) monk OR shot at mages?</strong><br/>\nMain problem (and true of all melee) was IGMS which was given to mages NWN as a means of \"balancing\" against the melee's dev.crit; otherwise, when it comes to SR, highest \"gear\" toolset if you will is a resistance 32 (a 20 monk has natural SR 30, which doesn't stack with SR items meaning only the highest number is taken into account, which epic mages (and spellswords with the spell pen feats) are or should be aware of, and account for so as to beat that standard toolset). By going more monk, you open up the ability to not only gain but also take (feats) more SR, but this comes at the cost of melee/warrior AB.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Mage?</strong><br/>\nIf it's mages you are after, the SR is very important (can't dev.crit the mage if can't get to them, though with monk speed you do close the gap fast, and even faster with more monk in it; dex based = high reflex and with monk wis AC high AC (pretty awesome what monks can with gear achieve in terms of AC, really is) and this along with other immunities (including the good Paladin book) takes care of quite a lot of the Bigby's, not to mention immunity to fear, mind-effects and death magic (4th level paladin spell) as well, so as to be immune to pretty much most of what it is that mages do, with the exception of IGMS (which, I say again, is a problem for many melee, being the \"flip side\" for mages if you will of what the melee's dev.crit is to mages, not to mention of course KD since mages --or anything else for that matter--can't do much when on their backs). Things to keep in mind if you want to take on some mages--in short: MORE MONK! Dex is best, train stealth and use your fist (alternatively, DEX with ITWF and holy sword your kama, +5 weapon so as to breach DR even though the dispel factor is for all intents and purposes a thing of the past these days on account of the patch as said, such that you wont be slicing through (dispelling) mages with it anymore these days, and just how it is). Do be sure either way to take Impr.Crit, as that's how high apr (albeit low ab, on account of the progression table of course) make the most use of all that apr so as to deliver damage in turn. Such a monk while a nice shot obviously at the mages, doesn't make for a melee combatant (dex based for one thing with no uncanny is not good, as all that AC goes out the window when caught flat-footed--KD'd, attacked from stealth, etc, which mages don't do, but lots of other things like i.e melee both PCs and melee monsters, as well as rogues and invisible things do). Then, can't have it all, right? <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Combat monk?</strong><br/>\nOn the other hand, if you want a well rounded combat monk, 20 Monk/15-16 Paladin (for the full book, albeit dispellable PvP the naked stats are still nice (can attain a nice Naked AB 44, bring on the good pally book for so much more and just fine for PvM/E in fact, with all the immunities, etc. in tact); if go Str based for dev.crit, dual wield kamas with flurry there be damage alright, but the requirements are such that you'll need your Paladin buffs to hit; yes, less than 24 pal = dispel factor, but there's ALWAYS Mord's (if this were PvP we were talking about, bank on Mord's always), but not so much an issue PvM/E by contrast, and rather easy to toss up a divine favor in any event (you have monk speed so as to get out and back in, right?). Monks are prohibited from wearing armor or using weapons other than their fist or kamas. By going less than mid-Pally you aren't getting any benefits there, nor are you making good use of monk by going non-monk weapon (i.e., long sword/item: avenger) either. By going mid-Pal/high Monk, you get both since Pal comes with Holy Sword (for what it's worth post-patch, still a nice albeit short lived +5 weapon with damage boni v. evil, divine based meaning it can't be resisted, and cast on kama gives you all that great monk apr plus flurry as well, so that's nice. (CF. your fist, which you can't really buff--ie no Greater Magic Fist or Holy Fist for e.g., and the crit range on unarmed if looking to dev.crit isn't that great as well, with fewer flurries also as compared to dual-wield kamas). By contrast, dual-wield kama add flurry means you strike at your enemies fast and furious such that you'll be forcing those crits/the fort save v insta death a lot, so no worries as you will with all that apr force the crits despite kama's crit range. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf so, less monk, more COT and Paladin (Pal for the good warrior BAB and spell book, which is nice as said; monk gives you the KD/IKD, cleave, etc.). 9-11 monk is more than enough, 14+ CoT (saves, feats including ITWF, monk gives you cleave, KD/IKD for free so not feat starved this way either), rest into Paladin (15+ for the good book), 14 Wis needed for your good book which Wis also goes to your Monk AC (and which AC unlike DEX is not lost when caught flat-footed, etc., either, so that's nice), with nice saves, immunities, etc. too. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see, by going against the monk's motto (against armor and all weapons excepting only fist and kama) you gain nothing really from monk, meantime, by not taking 15+ levels of Paladin you deny yourself the benefits of that class as well, whose warrior BAB and good spell book actually give you what it is you are wanting here, without more, only need more of it as has been said. <br/>\n<br/>\nMeantime, on the Pulse/Search engine here's some other combos for you to look at and gain some ideas from, though these builds are old (dating back to patch 1.67, much has changed since then, much of those changes being covered already in this thread, though other things remain the same so perhaps some ideas in this dusty old collection of builds for you to glean, depending once again on which way it is that you wish to go with your Divine Templar (great thing about monks and Paladins both, some great synnergies to explore, depending on where you want to go with it). There are 9 such old buids, according to the Pulse/Search engine, which are to be found here:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/buildsearch/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/buildsearch/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nRevised Gnomish Templar champion of Torm 27 / monk 7 / paladin 6 (gnome) by MauvaisGuillame<br/>\nTorm's Enlightnment monk 6 / paladin 4 / champion of Torm 30 (human) by Thaxll'ssyllia<br/>\n Serene Avenger monk 6 / paladin 16 / champion of Torm 18 (human) by Ithacan <br/>\nRiding Archer paladin 14 / champion of Torm 25 / monk 1 (human?) by VectorZulu <br/>\nRighteous cutter paladin 20 / champion of Torm 10 / monk 10 (human) by Medeia Lydian<br/>\n The Right Hand of Torm paladin 4 / monk 6 / champion of Torm 30 (human) by mphacon<br/>\n Mage Slayer paladin 15 / monk 20 / champion of Torm 5 (human) by TyrTemplar <br/>\nWitchhunter v.2 paladin 16 / monk 18 / champion of Torm 6 (human) by christian.schnabel<br/>\n Sardonic Savior paladin 18 / monk 12 / champion of Torm 10 (human?) by MauvaisGuillame <br/>\n<br/>\nTrust this helps, and welcome once again.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
