After the lovely halfling rogue you guys helped me make (May they rest in peace, after being a sacrifice to drow.) I was wondering if you guys could potentially help me create a Elf (or half elf, but preferred elf)\u00a0 Bard/AA? I do not know if a third class is suitable, but I'd love help, and opinions it would be greatly appreciated, Thanks!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I am also aware of the fact that it is a RP server.<br/>\n When you write bard/aa, there pop up several builds in my head. Do you want it to be a pure archer, or do you also want some melee capability? Do you intend to play solo or to play in parties? How much empasis do you want to put on the bard part? 16 levels or more for a strong song and spells, or is bard there just to qualify for the aa class?\u00a0 Are there any skills that are important for your RP? Have you considered a third class in the build, and if so do you mind 20% xp penalty for some levels? And last, to what extent is half elf an option here?<br/>\n I know that you have addressed some of these questions in the op, but it would help me a lot if we could narrow it down some more.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

We need information to build you a character. I don't mean any offense, but why don't you consider a little more the kind of character that you want to play and then come back to us\u00a0with your mind made up? Let me help you out by sort of outlining the questions that you should ask yourself:<br/>\n<br/>\n 1 - Is he good, neutral\u00a0or evil? This will let us know what other classes we can use in the build.<br/>\n 2 - Do you want him to specialize in Longsword or do you want him to be more versatile? This will tell us whether you want a Fighter / Weapon Master or not.<br/>\n 3- What kind of RP will you give him? Will he be a military man? A sword-for-hire? Some sort of Battle Lord? There are certain classes that will be more RP-friendly with certain types of personality.<br/>\n 4- Do you want him to be able to use Magic Items (such as scrolls and wands)\u00a0and items\u00a0that are specific for\u00a0other classes?<br/>\n 5- Any Race preference?<br/>\n<br/>\n If you answer these questions, we'll have a much clearer idea of the kind of character you want and it'll be much easier to build him for you. I can make 10 different Longsword Fighters with different skillsets, strengths and weaknesses, the possibilities are endless.

But, yes, you're questions make it easier on me, so I'll be happy to answer them one at a time.<br/>\n<br/>\n 1. I was thinking more of Lawful Neutral if possible. You know so I don't have to be a \"paladin\" persay, whilst doing good, following certain laws, and obligations.<br/>\n 2. Since I have no true knowledge on what a weapon master has to offer (outside of the katana so do tell me if I am missing a larger picture). So, unless, weapon master does have a good reason otherwise, probably a longsword.<br/>\n 3. I was going to make him somewhat of that (Try to join the guard, Navy, or waymen at some point.) But, also in his free time he available for service in others, hopefully a strength user, however.<br/>\n 4. Magic Items, I'd be lying if I didn't had hoped for him to be able to use basic scrolls, like raise dead, or even some for buffs (though, some potions also save the problem.) Though, in a large front I'd like to make use of the Heal skill for healing kits<br/>\n 5. Human if anything possible Human.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You can be a Longsword master, which will extend the Critical Hit range by 2 and add x1 multiplier for your longsword. After 10 Weapon Master levels, you'll gain +1 AB per every 3 levels of Weapon Master you take. Since Arelith is a level 30 server, you really won't be able to make the most out of the AB bonus it gives, as the maximum WM levels you can have is 19 (+3 AB with a Longsword). You also get 1 Bonus feat every 3 levels after 10. <br/>\n<br/>\n Allright, a military man will be a highly-trained fighter, so a Weapon Master could fit quite well. As for a 3rd class, Rogue doesn't fit because you'll be Lawful, nor Bard because of alignment conflicts. The only 3 classes we can use for Tumble dumps are Harper Scout, Shadowdancer and Monk.

Running at that point, makes it out of character if they block all the exits, I had no choice but to fight (died, got resurrected, ended up becoming their sacrficial pawn.) Loved every second of the encounter, but died a horrendous death xD</div>\n</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">\n Hey man! That's wrong. Freedom helps against Hold Person. Perhaps you should consider equipping yourself properly before venturing into Drow territory. You need to know your weaknesses and minimize them with gear. I'm not suggesting that you run when you see them, but what fool would face many lvl 30 characters at level 13? You know there's nothing more RP-fitting than WANTING TO LIVE lol<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div>\n</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">True except the drow were in our \"Good guy\" Territory, this may be why they say never venture at night alone xD But, I guess I'm that fool :3. Not smart on my opinion looking at it, probably should've screamed like a banshee and ran o.o</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If you yourself saw a gang of really rugged-looking individuals who look MUCH stronger than you, would you stand your ground or run? Unless your toon has 6 INT, he will notice that he has no chance of winning and have enough appreciation for his life to live to fight another day, just like Aragorn and Th\u00e9oden did in LOTR - The Two Towers.<br/>\n<br/>\n But, no mistake is a waste if you learn from it, so, it's not all that grim!<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
