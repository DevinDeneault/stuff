Even adding IPA is worth considering in some builds. <br/>\nThe same is valid for Expertise and IE.<br/>\nThe weakness of these builds is the low will save. One really should try to find items that grant immunities vs mind effects.<br/>\nAnd in a Dev crit build the fort save should also be as high as possible to survive dev crit duels. <br/>\nIn this Dev crit build I would try to find room for Great fortitude and Epic fortitude, and perhaps even Luck of heroes. One way of clearing two general feats is to aim for str 32. The AB and damage would still be high enough.<br/>\nMick</div>",

      "content": "<div>Mick, will saves are the typical weakness of melee (and easist thing to shore up--i.e. clarity potions and mind-blank scrolls). In terms of PvP, couldn't possibly agree more with the importance of the Fort save, though. And reason why under the level guide I put in the option to take Epic Fort.   <br/>\n<br/>\nSo glad you asked about it, and important to highlight, along with the fact (me bad) that somehow I neglected to put in the additional option to swap IKD for great fort pre-ep (this, for PvP, as I always recommend, but for some reason missed putting that in, so very glad you asked! Thanks). Et VOILA: +6 Fort (which is good, and which players will enjoy much better in PvP than IKD, I agree. (Note: IKD being nice to have PvM/E for downing \"huge\" things like dragons, etc., but not so important PvP where it's an AB/attack roll check against discipline (so AB/STR very nice there, too!). <br/>\n<br/>\nWith high STR speaking not only to the AB, but also all the Dev.Crit (DC) factor (DC 42 / 48 cap is high, and more than does the trick, I agree; but I like my AB/damage set-ups, always did (you hit, you crit. Things die. Simple). All that STR bolstered by WS/EWS multiplies beautifully on a crit, too! So don't be messing with the AB/damage set-up, or Dev.Crit DC either--this be a PG/melee warrior, all about the crit.factor and focussed around same (going the Fort option as set out above under the level guide, and swapping IKD with Great Fort for more of it if PvP'ing your Blade, which is important, I agree with you). You hit, you crit. NEXT. (Enemies die fast, and chews through mobs like there's no tomorrow...<br/>\n<br/>\nKi is cool, too, and yes, Expertise and PA actually can be used! Also nice that the patch fixed up whirlwind attack, which in pre-patch never used, but now that it's fixed/working ... heh, enjoy! No, don't need so much AB/DC if PvM/E, but I LOVE my AB/damage, and also the fact that with high STR and WS/EWS, your Blade won't exactly be standing around poking say an undead boss with a scimmy as those things be crit. immune, so you'll be most happy to have all that STR (AB/damage) in tact so as to dispatch the crit.immune nicely, too! <br/>\n<br/>\nNo such thing as too much AB/damage on a melee--you hit, you crit, things die, with lots of non-crit damage coming in on the crit.immune (including an actually useful PA, etc., too). Yes, high AB is nice, just plain nice, I tell you!  ). That said, and in PvP especially, no such thing as too much saves either, and why the option is there, along with swapping IKD for more of it, too (so don't be messing with the STR/AB-damage set-up, especially when it comes to the dev.crit, as no such thing as too much DC either .. heh, heh). Thanks, Mick, and what can I say: just love this guy adn still do, so revisiting that old series was inevitable (a given, really; heh, memories, eh?). And yes, more Fighting Bards to come, to be revisited in light of 1.69 patch, so stay tuned, folks (thanks again, Mick, appreciate the comment and the question). <br/>\n<br/>\nSlash, sing and Crit ON~ Tyr</div>"
