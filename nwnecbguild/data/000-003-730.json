      "content": "<div>I assume that this build is made for WoG so some of the things I write below might not apply since I haven't played on the server myself. I have played plenty of mages in the past though, and I've got a PvP Rog/Wiz/SD planned for the server I'm currently playing on. There are a few things I would change about the build, but a DC mage with HiPS, Rogue skills, and Keen Senses is a very strong build on most servers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best level spread for this type of build is Rog3/Wiz36/SD1, currently you're using the second SD level to make your skill progression smoother even though it doesn't really add anything useful. If you change the pre-epic spread to Rog1/Wiz18/SD1 you will get +1 Reflex and early HiPS at the cost of 1 AB (which is near useless for you anyway). This will also mean that you can take a second rogue level near 30 to max UMD and then the final rogue level at 40 to max all skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suggest changing the starting stats to 8STR/14DEX/14CON. In my opinion 40 HP is more important for a mage than carry capacity or AC, especially since this is an elf rather than a gnome.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou should swap Blind Fight, Stealthy, and Epic Spell Penetration for Epic Spell Focus in a school. If mobs on WoG have very high saves then this might be a bad suggestion, but making a DC mage that doesn't max DCs is a huge waste. Evocation and Necromancy are the standard spell schools for single focus mages but the most effective will depend on your server. If you're not planning on being a DC mage then you should change your focus to a CON based nuke mage.<br/>\nI would also suggest swapping EMA for Epic Skill Focus: Concentration, since in my experience if you're getting hit at all then you've messed up somewhere. Even if you build for AC you'll struggle to reach even 65 AC in a +5 AC environment, so it's usually better to (ab)use summons and DC spells when fighting rather than AC tank.<br/>\nFor metamagic feats you take Silent Spell and Empower Spell which are great, but I would try to fit in Maximize Spell and possibly Extend Spell too by dropping spell penetration feats. If you're committed to just 2 metamagic feats then Silent and Empower are probably the best choice for this build.<br/>\nIf you decide to keep the spell penetration feats, move SPen to level 3 and GSPen to level 6. Spell penetration is most useful at early levels and become less effective as your caster level increases and you gain access to breach spells. If you decide to keep Epic Spell Penetration then move it from level 39 to level 21, by the time you get it in this build it's practically useless.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor skills, I suggest increasing Set Trap to 40/41 (for 16/14 DEX) so that you can set epic traps on a 20. I also think you should aim for 36 or 41 UMD rather than 34, but that's mainly because I prefer getting more than the bare minimum required for scroll use. Personally I would drop one of Listen or Spot and max Search instead, but I don't know if that would be worthwhile on WoG. You should try to streamline your skill progression and reduce the number that you save every level, but overall your skills are well chosen.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Regarding choosing SD in a mage build, this might be a case of choices that aren't good on WoG but are great elsewhere.<br/>\nI've played on plenty of servers where See Invisibility is freely available but vanilla True Seeing isn't, both in PvM and PvP. In those environments the only way to reliably avoid detection is to use stealth rather than invisibility. Stealth and invisibility might have similar effects against some enemies but there are enough differences for HiPS to be useful. Especially since it's near-instantaneous, can't be counterspelled, and never runs out, even if it's not always effective in PvM due to NPC detect.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Well, of course, customizing your Mage (this is a Mage build, btw) to the environment is a must!<br/>\n<br/>\nNo way to argue that one.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just do not see HiPS as useful in most environments, as HiPS gets nuked.\u00a0 Either it is on a cooldown, or everyone and their brother has TS.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn an environment where that is not so, then by all means, take that 1 SD level.\u00a0 Pump that HS and MS.\u00a0 Mages have skill points to burn, baby!<br/>\n<br/>\nIF we are talking about WoG (looks around the corner to see if Mick is coming), where HiPS is on a cooldown timer, and where real TS is present in some creatures (as I have recently found out), HiPS is a less interesting feat imo.\u00a0 Normally, one can \"spam\" the HiPS on the quickbar to \"break\" the spell focus of a creature, for a variety of reasons (like avoiding Mord's, Greater Ruin, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\nOn WoG, the Big Bosses will not be impressed by your HiPS, because of the cooldown timer and real TS.\u00a0 They are mostly Hasted (and some perma), so they will have two castings per round, which basically makes \"breaking\" spell focus much harder.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, since most of the Big Bo's have major magical DR, your IGMS spam (which is already nerfed by limiting the number of missles) just sting a bit - I once unloaded over 39 IGMSs at a certain Big Boss on WoG, and it just tickled it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI consider spell penetration feats on WoG for a high level Mage a must!\u00a0 All have powerful SR, that normally needs to be brought down with Mord's, etc before showboating damage spells, or they will pelter off.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo for an environment like WoG, I don't see wasting a level for SD here.\u00a0 I can do it better with Gr. Sanc scrolls.\u00a0 Impr. Invis wands.\u00a0 That is what a Wizard is, flexible, being able to use spells and resources to get the task done.\u00a0 <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I am not against taking a level of SD.\u00a0 Pop it in there, sure.\u00a0 I just do not see the need.\u00a0 The Rogue is goodness, and I can see the reason for taking it.\u00a0 Assassin would do practically the same, for 1 less level (cement that AC!, get Tumble, get UMD), involve no XP penalty, dependingly, but has to be evil.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake a level of Cleric, instead, for that sweet Animal Domain.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one is going to keep the SD, by all means do so, and pump that HS and MS.</div>"

I know a base ranged AB of 23 is awful really, might be 50/50 to hit against a mob perhaps, and 5% against a boss<br/>\n<br/>\nAny advice on whether spell focus evocation vs necromancy?

Constant HiPS spamming is only useful when fighting ranged attackers or spotters, using it once to cause an action cancel is enough against most other opponents. Since you can only attack or cast spells at the start of the round you shouldn't need to use HiPS more than once per round, you can simply disengage and run until the start of the next round. I've played on servers where HiPS has restrictions on distance or was limited to once per 3 rounds and didn't have a problem, so once per round should be enough for most opponents.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Orion,<br/>\nVery nice build.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn line with some of the previous comments, I recommend dropping Stealthy to take Spell Penetration sooner, if Spell Penetration is the route to take. If you're aiming for max level 40 power, drop Spell Penetration altogether and pick up either Spell Focus: Evocation or Spell Focus: Necromancy. With the Epic version of these, your DC spell of choice (Meteor Swarm or Wail of the Banshee) would have a DC 39 before +INT items.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf high SR is a concern, use Empowered Evard's Black Tentacles, Time Stop, summons, and shields. At lower levels, buffing up that Wolf or Spider does nasty things to almost everything. Also, the knockdown effect from Grease does not check SR (only the slow).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor skills, if you take 6 ranks Spellcraft at level 3, you would get a +2 save vs. spells without impacting the build in any way. At level 16, another 3 ranks into Spellcraft bumps the build to +3 save vs. spells. These work their way out at level 22, where you would only take 16 ranks in Spellcraft.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you had more Rogue levels, I would recommend going Necromancer for the extra spell slot. In this build, it's a long time between Disable Trap skill dumps to go without the Find Traps spell.</div>"
