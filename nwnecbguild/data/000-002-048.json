But basically, I am assuming that the PC in my example has base hit points that is well below the amount of damage that he receives from attacking enemies, but he relies on items that give him +1760 HP regeneration. To restate my question, how often does the game check for a character's hit points within a combat round? If the PC heals itself, would it somehow help, or does the amount of regeneration he receives in a round override any benefit?</div>"
