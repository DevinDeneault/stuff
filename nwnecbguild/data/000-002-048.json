This immunity is called by the spell resistance check, and serves as the second barrier to blocking magical attacks.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a PC equips an item that makes one 'immune to spells level 4 and lower', does it mean he is still vulnerable to lesser spell breach, which does not check SR?<br/>\n(There is an a 'lesser spell breach immunity' item property though.)<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: Playtested so I knew the answer to my question. PC would still be vulnerable to the breach, at least its SR lowering effect. Even immunity to LSB will still make the character vulnerable.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
