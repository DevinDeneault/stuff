      "content": "<div>The recent topic about bards, reminded me to bring out of the closet an old archer build that i had based on the stacking of epic weapon specialization &amp; arcane archer's enchant arrow, boosted by a full blown epic bard song. While this thing has been tried a few times, there is none that went for full bard levels in order to get lasting inspiration which is a huge plus in my book. Arcane archers are quite formidable as they are-and this one even more so, because the buffing potencial is enormus but even without buffing you have a 50 attack bonus and more than 20 damage per arrow.<br/>\n<br/>\n I made this build with \"safety\" as a priority and that is why i have optimized the stats this way and i have chosen a half-elf as the race of my choice. Heck, if you feel vulnerable or you are taking your first steps in arcane archers, put your full plate ON &amp; pelt the enemy with arrows claded in that. To be noted, there are no experience penalties whatsoever in this build. For the more experienced, you will drop the half for a full blown elf and start with an 18 dexterity and you will drop either concentration or discipline (depends on immunity items via umd) &amp; take taunt as a skill. Those changes will help you acquire an attack bonus from 2 to 8 points higher even.<br/>\n<br/>\n She can cast, she can buff, she can sing, she can curse &amp; she can dance like a snowflake while pelting her enemies with arrows!<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://i1375.photobucket.com/albums/ag474/valerfor/Divine%20Archer_zpslxcyxu0g.jpg\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:120%;line-height:normal\"><em><strong>Snowflake's Wardance</strong></em></span><br/>\n<br/>\n (Bard 20/ Fighter 6/ Arcane Archer 14)<br/>\n<br/>\n RACE: Half - Elf<br/>\n<br/>\n ALIGNMENT: <span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>Any non-lawful, recommended:</strong></span> Chaotic Neutral<br/>\n<br/>\n PLAYABILITY: PvM 1 - 40<br/>\n<br/>\n STARTING STATS:<br/>\n STR -\u00a0 14<br/>\n DEX -\u00a0 14<br/>\n CON - 14<br/>\n INT -\u00a0\u00a0 14<br/>\n WIS -\u00a0 08<br/>\n CHA - 14<br/>\n<br/>\n ENDING STATS:<br/>\n STR -\u00a0 14<br/>\n DEX -\u00a0 26<br/>\n CON - 14<br/>\n INT -\u00a0\u00a0 14<br/>\n WIS -\u00a0 08<br/>\n CHA - 16<br/>\n<br/>\n Hit Points: 412<br/>\n<br/>\n Skill Points: 246<br/>\n Concentration: 42 (44)<br/>\n Discipline: 42 (44)<br/>\n Lore: 8 (30)<span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong> [9 (31)]</strong></span><br/>\n Perform: 42 (44) <span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>[42 (45)] \u2190 (reaches Bard Song 19)</strong></span><br/>\n Spellcraft: 38 (40)<br/>\n Tumble: 40 (48)<br/>\n UMD: 33 (35)<span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong> [33 (36)]</strong></span><br/>\n<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fort/Ref/Will): 24/ 31/ 18 \u2192 35/ 42/ 30 (saves Vs spells &amp;

Together they become so strong that I had to look at what happens if you drop Fighter. An elven Bard 21/ AA 19 (dex 28) will have +3 AB and -3 damage compared with Snowflake. You have to drop 2 pre epic feats (Toughness is the easy one) and get less HP, but you get the Bard spells earlier and can take LI way earlier. You still have a spare Bard level for a late skill-dump.<br/>\nBut if I crawl down that rabbit hole, I'm afraid that I end up with Bard 11/ AA 29, so maybe Fighter is all right after all.</div>",

What am I missing?</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">It assumes that in some cases the toon will opt to go s/s when certain conditions arise.\u00a0 Any martial weapon suitable for finessing is a suitable candidate as well as unarmed, perhaps shortsword or dagger.\u00a0 Matters little which is chosen because without WF/EWF and the AA bow boosts, it will not be as reliable.\u00a0 If you notice, Valerfor \"conveniently\" neglected to include the finnessed AB which would illuminate exactly that fact.<br/>\n<br/>\n IMO arranging for melee finessing is a waste in an AA build and wonder if those who suggest this ever actually played an AA extensively through to Level 40 anywhere.\u00a0 I have yet to find any situation where the loss of AB switching down from a PBS bow to a pedestrian s/s combo actually improves any situation. If it does, they don't know how to play a PBS AA. I am guessing the designer had a spare feat selection to fill so chose what was thought to be the most useful. Most likely <em>Iron Will</em> or <em>SkF: Perform</em> would have served better, had better implementation throughout the build.\u00a0 I don't blame you for being confused, Icingblade.\u00a0 The last thing an AA needs, bardic or otherwise, is any feat dedicated to melee.<br/>\n<br/>\n Actually, I do like long-duration singers but this one arrives too late to be of much use except on dedicated 40 cap servers where you get to play the finished build a lot.\u00a0 It would have been more expeditious and party-friendly (assuming you have mates in need of a singer) to get <em>Lasting Inspiration</em> ASAP (@Lvl 27-30).\u00a0 Then a late bard dump to Tumble/UMD/Disc.\u00a0 That would require a 21st bard and losing the AA bonus (again, too late to matter all that much except on paper).\u00a0 The starting ability spread can be tweaked up to Dex 15 without much effort (Bard spellcasting develops so slowly, there is plenty of time to achieve CHA 16).\u00a0 I believe Mick's comments pretty much echo these exact sentiments (early LI).<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and btw, another stat that was neglected was the effect of Curse Song on the singer's AB &amp; AC.\u00a0 The -5 enemy AC curse effectively boosts the singer's AB by 5 and the -2 enemy AB simultaneously increases the singer's AC by 2.\u00a0 These effects will stack with those of the bard song and may even reach higher level curse level due to the previous bard song's skill boost.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Rambling now, apologies. :(</div></div>"
