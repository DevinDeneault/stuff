Or Spell Pen/Greater Spell Pen.<br/>\nIt has silent/empower/max for 0-1-2-3 IGMS and extend for damage shields combined with PM's crit/sneak immunity.<br/>\nI take toughness and boost starting Con to 16 to assist with a damage shield strategy, with 370hp it can be capped at 610hp, with crit/sneak immunity + premonition/epic warding there should be enough to make it work.<br/>\nI go Cha 32 so spells that require DC rolls can be effective there are a few I am interested in, grease, stinking cloud (one can protect yourself against your own mind affecting spells with Prot v Evil), 0-1-2-3 Flame Arrow / Firebrand, 0-1-2 Finger of Death, 0-1 Horrid Wilting and Wail.<br/>\nSpell penetration could be tricky mid epics, with SP 18+1d20 at level 30 but I think Mord's which can lower spell resistance by 10, can help gap the breach there, and will be the level 9 spell taken with Sorc 18.<br/>\nUndispellability is obtained at level 36, which is a little late, however it was a choice between that at level 36 or PM 10's crit/sneak immunity, and the crit + sneak immunity seemed stronger.<br/>\nBlackguard allows for heavy armor / shields to be equipped in an environment where spellsword equipment (ie -arcane failure) is available, an alternative is to use crafted magic (scrolls/wands) with armor equipped, although my intention is for this sorceress to only melee with damage shields up, this could help protect against archers.<br/>\nIt was tempting to go Blackguard 3 for a late divine shield feat, however I thought the other feats in this build provided more, and there seemed to be enough AC in the build already with PM 10 and EMA.<br/>\nThe strength requirements for Blackguard (due to Power Attack/Cleave) are not completely wasted, as often I find myself having to equip items to boost strength due to encumbrance.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Sorcerer(28), Pale Master(10), Blackguard(2), Human\nAny Evil\n\nDEX: 8\nWIS: 8\nCHA: 16 (32)\nHuman: (Quick to Master)\n02: Sorcerer(2)\n04: Sorcerer(4): CHA+1, (CHA=17)\n06: Sorcerer(6): Craft Wand\n08: Sorcerer(8): CHA+1, (CHA=18)\n10: Sorcerer(10)\n12: Sorcerer(12): CHA+1, Silent Spell, (CHA=19)\n14: Sorcerer(14)\n16: Sorcerer(16): CHA+1, (CHA=20)\n18: Pale Master(2): Cleave\n20: Blackguard(2): CHA+1, {Smite Good}, (CHA=21)\n22: Sorcerer(18)\n24: Pale Master(4): CHA+1, Great Charisma I, (CHA=23)\n26: Pale Master(6)\n28: Pale Master(8): CHA+1, (CHA=25)\n30: Pale Master(10): Great Charisma III, (CHA=26)\n32: Sorcerer(20): CHA+1, (CHA=27)\n34: Sorcerer(22)\n36: Sorcerer(24): CHA+1, Great Charisma IV, (CHA=29)\n38: Sorcerer(26): Great Charisma V, (CHA=30)\n40: Sorcerer(28): CHA+1, (CHA=32)\nHitpoints: 370\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 35/33/25\nBAB: 21\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 18/29\nAlignment Changes: 0\nConcentration 43(46), Disable Trap 1(2), Hide 5(4), Listen 33(32), Open Lock 1(0), Search 8(9), Set Trap 1(0), Spellcraft 39(40), Tumble 15(14)\n01: Concentration(4), Disable Trap(1), Open Lock(1), Search(1), Set Trap(1), Spellcraft(4),\u00a0\n03: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(2),\u00a0\n05: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(6),\u00a0\n07: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n09: Concentration(1), Search(1), Spellcraft(1),\u00a0\n11: Concentration(1), Search(1), Save(2),\u00a0\n13: Concentration(1), Save(8),\u00a0\n15: Concentration(1), Save(14),\u00a0\n17: Concentration(1), Listen(18), Save(2),\u00a0\n19: Concentration(1), Save(3),\u00a0\n21: Concentration(1), Save(9),\u00a0\n23: Concentration(1), Listen(5),\u00a0\n25: Concentration(1), Listen(2), Spellcraft(1),\u00a0\n27: Concentration(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(2),\u00a0\n29: Concentration(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(2),\u00a0\n31: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(3),\u00a0\n33: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(3),\u00a0\n35: Concentration(1), Search(2),\u00a0\n37: Concentration(1), Save(6),\u00a0\n39: Concentration(1), Tumble(5), Save(2),\u00a0</details>\n<br/>\nOther related builds:<br/>\n- <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build272583.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sorcerer King</a> by TyrTemplar, has less HP in exchange for spell foci / divine shield (I like a high HP palemaster to tank for parties with the damage shields, it is more forgiving)<br/>\n- <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build225040.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Doom Lich</a> by Almalith, a CON based Sorc with the same class split<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
