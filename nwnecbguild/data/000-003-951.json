I'm pretty sure this holds true for most of you. Whether you've read the books or just watched the series; or most likely have read and watched both, I'm sure none of you are strangers to this saga.<br/>\n<br/>\nInspired by the BG thread, here's a challenge: pick a character of your liking from Martin's A song of Ice and Fire saga and try to build a NWN character based on them. You can pick the show version of the character, the book version or even characters exclusive to each.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would start myself, but I'm still not confident enough on my builds to do so. However, if this thread takes off, I might post a character that I've been planning to use on a module I won't name yet.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">It's an intriguing idea Pelagius, but a couple of things come to mind. First, demonstrably, the paladin class is a no-go area. I would have said Brianna of Tarr could be a candidate, but charisma? 'Fraid not. Second, most of the \"best\" characters, in my opinion, wouldn't suit Neverwinter at all. Tyrion? Circe? Schemers and plotters do much better in strategy games.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as I say, an intriguing idea. I'm assuming the leader of the White Walkers would be a PM. Would you have the Kaleesi as a summoner or shifter (playing a little loose, here)? An assassin or two for Mick to look at. But there would be an awful lot of straight up fighter-types and a very limited mage and cleric spread.<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch to think about, you have given us (from a different fantasy trope).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The saga begins with her as about 10 years old, youngest daughter of a lord (Ned Stark). She is being instructed in how to be a \"lady\", but prefers her secret swordplay lessons with the court's fencing master. After travelling to the capital with her father, she then witnesses his execution (I'm rushing this, I know) and strives to get home to what remains of her family while undercover. Assorted mishaps happen en route, and, while travelling back with the Hound - a brutal killer, whom she goads, but also develops a bond with - she also witnesses her eldest brother and mother killed just as she hopes to be reunited with them. Further missteps and missed chances occur, and she finds herself on foreign shores with a school of assassins, wanting to learn the craft and avenge her family.<br/>\n<br/>\nI reckon that's a reasonable place to start.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Double-ninja'd!<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT 2: Ned Stark still can't be a pally - he's no holy warrior, he's the king's best mate. I could buy CoT with him just about, but Fighter/WM would be his main classes, I suspect (after all, Kingslayer really wants to challenge him - albeit under unfair conditions - because of his martial prowess and legend). Talking of Pretty-Boy Lanister - design him as stumpy or not?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Eddard Stark might not be a holy warrior in the literal sense but he could teach many paladins some lessons. And let's not ride into the weapon-master wagon here because that would leave us with no classes left to depict sir Barristan Selmy &amp; sir Arthur Dayne \"the sword of the morning\". ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, most of them are simply warriors &amp; rogues and not \"optimized\" at all. If they were to be made in Neverwinter Nights then they should look somewhat like the old builds of ECB, era 04-06' or so, less specialized but more multi-talented. Throw lots of rogue in there for the skills &amp; sneak-attack, make less use of dump-stats, most importantly, have a good concept so that each one looks different from the others. The most experienced of them should have better AB than the others but no-one should be in excess of 40-42 AB. Keep that for the truly fearsome warriors like sir Barristan Selmy or sir Jorah Mormont.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I have an idea if you all agree, instead of starting yet another topic like the BG II NPC's one, we could concentrate our builds into one place called \"Role-playing builds\". If a moderator exists still then he could make us a \"sticky\" like the old one with the vanilla builds and we could put every good concept-build into that one. Those builds could be of use in role-playing heavy worlds were less emphasis in power-building is given, like AMIA or Arelith. Typically those PW's are low-to-medium magic as well, so it fits with the concept even better.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might try my hand in one of these characters once I have some free time, meanwhile, you can refer to gdl's old \"Valkyrie\" for a well-executed theme build.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build217045.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/buil ... 17045.html</a><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

What puzzles me is her bond with that (dire?) wolf and other animals. What is the nature of those abilities?<br/>\nI also wonder about her ability to impersonate other people and how to represent that in a build. Does she disguise herself, is there some kind of bluff involved, or is she a talented actor playing different roles? There are different ways of translating that to a build.<br/>\nI know that she kills with her tiny sword and poisons people. Are there other ways of killing people that she uses? Does she use traps? Is there any magic, eg. enchantment involved?<br/>\nMany things point in the direction of a dexterous and cunning rogue build.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Well, in game terms Arya Stark was taught from the master of assassins. That guy is shown to be able to really do HiPS in at least one occasion. It is only natural that she \"graduated\" being able to do the same technique although she is still young to fully learn it exactly like he did. It is also already established that she is an assassin and that she poisons her weapons. The third part is that she is also shown to be able to hold her own against Brienne of Tarth in a mock battle and even produced a nifty trick with her dagger when the former tried to disarm her, passing it onto her other hand ready for a karmic strike. She did also kill the previous apprentice of the aforementioned master assassin and proved her worth to him. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt depends on how you interpret those things in deciding what her build could be. Some might say fighter/assassin/shadow-dancer is right but I, on the other hand, think that rogue/assassin/shadow-dancer is more appropriate for her. She does a lot of hiding in her early years and develops many rogue-like skills as well. She is definitely a dextrous type and she favours precision over brutal strength.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer bond with her dire wolf is severed early so she is not hanging with her anymore. Unless you count \"the hound\" (pun intended) as a pet...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe transformation part isn't natural (I know, you secretly wanted to make a cobold-commando shapeshifter out of her) but rather they use the carefully preserved skin of the faces of dead people to do these impersonations, along with some good acting.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">To expand on what Valerfor said, and to add a couple notes:<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the books there's a lot of that it is not clearly explained, and every thorough explanation you'll come across is mostly fandom speculation. Chapters are also written from a character's perspective and Martin plays a lot with hearsay, misinformation and uncomplete facts. So:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe sons/daughters of Eddar Stark find a handful of baby dire-wolves, each of them take one as a pet and somehow form an unsplained and not well understood bond with them, dire-wolves being sort of magical beings in a low-magic setting (low magic at the beginning, eventually the magice lvels grows steadily).<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile it is never properly staed how, Arya sort of \"wears\" the skin of someone and through a level of acting that would go beyong mere impersonation can actually almos \"turn\" into someone else. This has no proper translation to NW, but the closest thing, at least in spirit, would be HiPS and having levels on shadowdancer.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe's very skilled with short or light blades, uses poisons or daggers mostly to kill people and a lot of deception. So assassin would be an option.<br/>\n<br/>\nI see her as a rogue/assasin/shadowdancer. I guess bard could work but I don't know enough about that class to properly say.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I can try to make a build for Arya. I still don't understand her completely, but I'm getting closer.<br/>\nIf one can think of the bard class as something else than something you use to build an artist, then the class stands out as the only non lawful \"rogue\" class.\u00a0 It is a class that has access to illusion end enchantment magic. It has the touch of magic without being a dedicated mage. <br/>\nIt can even summon a dire wolf if need be. It might fit the bill.<br/>\nDruid has the shapeshifting, but it is linked to some kind of unity with nature, and that seems a bit farfetched.<br/>\nArcane magic enables much of what you describe, but she is not a magician, is she? And definitely not a priest.<br/>\nSome of you feel that SD might fit well and represent some of her talents. It is still not quite clear to me how SD does that.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I am left with Rogue, Bard, Assassin and Shadowdancer. <br/>\n<br/>\n@ Valerfor<br/>\nNo, I do not have a secret dream of making her a Kobold Commando. <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /> <br/>\nBut it would be nice to find a fictional character that could fit that kind of build.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Leaving aside the nicely worded \"touch of magic\", she did join an actors' troupe for a time (admittedly while on an assassination mission), which also fits. I wonder whether our SD thoughts might be more driven by the instinct to bring something \"different\" to the build, because she's always in plain sight, even if sometimes camouflaged.

Alright, you can't expect him to just \"vanish\" in thin air but you look at him and he just turns his back for a second, the next one he is already someone else! I guess this is as close we can come to D&amp;D HiPS in this very-low magic setting. Performing for the theatre might actually be just that, \"performing\" and rogues do have these skills in their repertoire, bluff, persuade, intimidate and so on. You already have the tools at your disposal to depict her, and even do a form of HiPS without shadow-dancer executing what is know as \"corner-sneaking\".<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is true that the level of magic keeps growing steadily but that is only as far as \"monsters\" are concerned because we are introduced slowly to things like giants and properly-sized dragons, the characters did not display any extraordinary abilities apart from the great druid, but he is almost an NPC at this point.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I believe I went Ro 8, then As 8 at lvl 16, SD5 at lvl 21, As 15 at lvl 28, Ro 10 for ED at lvl 30, and then AS 25 at lvl 40. The saves were worse, the SA/DA was weaker and I lost an epic assassin feat which gave a lower dex.<br/>\nSo basically it took 4 more SD levels rather than 3 rogue levels to get Defensive roll. That cost me the 26th assassin level and a bonus feat.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: I believe Rogue 13/ Assassin 22/ SD 5 would make it possible to take the same amount of feats and get the same number of Great dexterity feats. You take ED as a rogue bonus feat and an extra Great dexterity on a general feat. But the DA DC would suffer.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
