      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Lasting inspiration allows you to spend your song charges on curse song, using it basically every fight, and makes its use a lot safer. Because you have the buff song up \"all the time\", you just curse and start fighting immediately. If you don't, you have to buff very often (even more often than a cleric!), and you lose a round of the song while you curse. 1 round out of 10-15 is a lot more than that same round out of 100.

Assuming you go human (thus gaining a feat at L1) you'll still need 4 more feats - which is 6 levels of Fighter or 8 of CoT - to give the necessary WF, Expertise, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Att, WwAtt, Power Att, Cleave, Grt Cleave, Imp Crit, Div Shield, Div Might - the latter 2 of which you can't have without Pally or Cleric anyway. And that's without any KD or Blind Fighting. And, of course, we find we've run out of classes before even looking at factoring in at least 20 levels of Bard (incompatible with Pally in any case) in for LI.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the simple answer is, no.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'm beginning to think that this is the optimum alternative. It will give you +2AB/+5AC from Bard levels (+6AC if you can boost your Perform skill) and you'll only lose 1 AB from taking bard levels pre-epic. You can also get EWS and DevCrit.<br/>\nThe CoT option is not working, you need at least 10 levels of bard pre-epic, since you need 7BAB before you can take your first CoT.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Of course, if you lose them, that would allow for taking Curse and Lingering Song pre-epic if you juggle your Bard levels around a bit (like taking Bard 1 at level 3, 6 or 9, and Bard 2 at level 12) and altering the order in which you take your feats. If you did that, that's 2 more general epic feats freed up for more strength.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, as far as the skills are concerned, you only need a modified Perform of 30 to max your level 16 Song, and it would be good to take UMD to at least a modified 33 (gives you guaranteed success with any scroll), or even 35.

It's primarily BSK, but also Glorwing if that one gets online anytime soon. DevCrit on BSK is +35% bonus damage, so it's useful and cool, but has no DC.<br/>\nI'll see if I can work your feedback into a new build (or builds, one for BSK and one for Glorwing). It most definitely helps, thank you very much for the feedback!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
