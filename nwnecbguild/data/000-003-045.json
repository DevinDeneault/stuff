I know your gaming world has huge modifications that alter almost everything in the game but unless they have changed SD significantly there is almost nothing you can gain by getting 50 levels of it...<br/>\n<br/>\nThe opposite is true however, getting 50-55 levels of Monk and just enough SD for HiPS/ ED will get you a much higher AC (Monks continue to improve with levels) and also speed, not to mention this godly spell resistance!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I only had a brief look at the link, but some of those changes (apart from it being capped at level 60) include no arcane caster class required for RDD, and this Paragon is not a sub-race, rather an exemplar of his/her type (a bit like when people were working on Yardstick builds here). Of course, if you want a prestige class to be your paragon, you'll need to take the requisite feats/levels/etc before you can qualify for it. So, with non-prestige it's single class, but with prestige it's dual class.<br/>\n<br/>\nInteresting, but not exactly traditional!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
