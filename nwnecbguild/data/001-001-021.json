      "content": "<div>Not sure what to tell you, Valefor.\u00a0 The mod is designed for you to respawn rather than reload.\u00a0 Has a cool death plane which gives you the choice to return to point of death or to a bindstone.\u00a0 Probably the most consistently beautiful mod out there.\u00a0 Single hench.\u00a0 Class sets.\u00a0 Rated 2nd best mod ever by the NwN community for cutscenes.\u00a0 Convo editor says 400k words of dialogue, though obviously the player will see only a fraction of that.\u00a0 Well designed combat.\u00a0 Linear at the start and end but about 1/2 of the mod is completely non-linear, so lots to explore.\u00a0 Heaps of custom items and creatures.\u00a0 It's a unique world and story line but does draw much on FR.\u00a0 It has layers of possible immersion, from item descriptions to monster descriptions.\u00a0 Has an offensive sequencer, which was considered impossible at the time.\u00a0 Heaps of other stuff...\u00a0 :)\u00a0</div>"
