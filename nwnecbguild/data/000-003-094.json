      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hey all... I recently decided to try Nwn and got through the campaign (oc and expansions)<br/>\n<br/>\n I decided to try multiplayer, and after a lot of looking up discovered arelith.<br/>\n<br/>\n I wanted to try a sorcerer (I did a wizard through the original campaign and such). I didn't quite know the difference. I was hoping you'd not only help me build something, but explain to me the differences between the two. (Besides one using INT and the other CHA)<br/>\n<br/>\n I guess I should try to fill out as much as possible<br/>\n pvm or pvp - pvm, but I might get into pvp?...<br/>\n<br/>\n level cap 30<br/>\n<br/>\n Race preference? Elf<br/>\n<br/>\n Melee pref (none)<br/>\n<br/>\n Class Pref - Sorcerer, I don't know if anything good could be done alongside it. Except maybe a bard or paladin? But, that's just my wild guess since they all use CHA.<br/>\n<br/>\n Restricted classes<br/>\n Arcane Archer<br/>\n Blackguard<br/>\n Champion of Torm<br/>\n Dwarven Defender<br/>\n Shadowdancer<br/>\n Weapon Master<br/>\n These aren't the others are.<br/>\n<br/>\n Weapon pref -Quarterstaff (I suppose that's what I'd end up walking around with, with enchants..)<br/>\n<br/>\n Sorcerer changes (They don't seem all that reliable, but here they are)Path of the True FlameThe Path of the True Flame can be chosen at character creation by sorcerers. Followers of the Path of the True Flame get unlimited spells per day, but can cast only evocation spells. This limitation includes spells cast from scrolls, wands, and items like potions;Weave MasterWeave Master can be chosen at character creation by sorcerers. Weave masters get unlimited spells per day, but they trigger a cooldown period whenever they cast a spell above the first circle in which they cannot cast any spell. The Cooldown formula is: (Spell level -1)*6 seconds.Note that while the cooldown is still in effect, Weave Masters may still cast spells from other sources, like wands, scrolls and potions.The cooldown timer is based on the <em>spell slot</em>, and not the actual spell itself. So spells modified with metamagic, except Quicken Spell, will increase the cooldown accordingly. <ul><li>The metamagic Feat \"Quicken Spell\", when used to cast a spell, will reduce the effective level of the spell by 1 when calculating cooldowns.</li> </ul><ul><li>Using Quicken Spell once you have autoquicken will not decrease the cooldown further.</li> </ul><ul><li>Auto Quicken I: Spells of level 2-3 no longer have cooldown.</li> </ul>\n\n Now... I didn't know a good focus for the sorcerer... I was thinking evocation/necromancy , but I'm no expert at this at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n Any help is appreciated thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0If I missed something let me know!<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

My thinking (while acknowledging you're not looking for a spellsword) is maybe Pally/CoT (from the side of goodness) or Blackguard (from the evil-weevil one). They all make good use of CHA as well, and bring other things to the table - divine interventions, better saves, more bonus feats, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n As I say, I'm no expert, just trying to refine what you're looking for a bit.

For paladin or blackguard...<br/>\n<br/>\n (Now, I do want to do a caster, not a melee user, even though their limited in the spells, I inagine with enough combination it could be made to work.) Question is? Is just one spell focus good, and two limiting the already limited feats? (Cause if so..I might opt for a necromancy sorcerer) Since I don't think Evocation buffs up evo spells too dramatically. (Compared to like... wail which completely relies on DC)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, back to LG or LE. On one hand Paladin. I could be a Lawful Zealot, one who strives for justice, good, and all other stuff. On the otherhand, I could be a dark evil character...who upholds order and law....evil like xD. Kinda a choice of being a Luke or a Vader.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm leaning heavily on blackguard at the moment, but I was curious, say I wanted to make a 'good counterpart' all I would need to do is switch the alignment and choose paladin and its roughly the same, right?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That means that there is no Divine shield.<br/>\n What one gets from Paladin is heavy armor and shield,  a discipline dump and a huge bonus to saves. You also get martial weapons if you fancy that. Monk gives evasion,  tumble and another discipline dump. You also get access to class specific gear.<br/>\n An important part of the build idea is to cast in full armor and shield. For that you have still spell and the 3 auto-still feats. You also have the option to cast with +10AC from improved expertise. You also get epic necro focus, extend,empower and maximise.<br/>\n The build also has improved combat casting, EMA and EW.<br/>\n It is possible to cram most of that into a lvl 30 build,  but I dont know if it is possible under the Arelith rules.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

A 26 sorcerer has a better chance of being dispelled due to the changes (even a pure lvl 30 is practically pushing it, unless its a bard song or as you said divine shield)<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, you have a good logic, but 26 spellcaster (with arelith changes) are a 50/50 split. A 50 chance you won't or you will be dispelled. That's not changing, but one thing is. Greater/Mord. People got them basically on speed dial. (Wands and scrolls, creatures will spam it, traps with dispel). Now, even though he has that disadvantage, it wouldn't be such a big deal right? Here's the kicker. The cap was removed. So, normally you get hit by lesser, dispel, or greater. You typically either resist, or have all your dispellable buffs removed. Now, imagine it's an AOE effect, ... everyone's buffs are now gone (not just the strongest of each one).<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, if it didn't horrendously hinder his DC, that's why I recommended the bard for tumble. Unless you're rocking a 30 wiz or Sorc. (Or just powering up with divine/bard song) You will get dispelled. Maybe not the first, or even second one. But, eventually it would go through on him.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

There is no way any of us have time to spend learning every server's custom ruleset so a shortcut would seem prudent.<br/>\n<br/>\n Here on the ECB we design mainly for NWN though occasionally will make suggestions for these sorts of quasi-AD&amp;D worlds if given enough information.\u00a0 But don't expect the random disclosure to stick long.\u00a0 NWN has been embedded in our minds for over 10 years and hard to forget. That's why a permanent record would serve your cause better.<br/>\n<br/>\n Expositions like this should appear in the lead post to stand any hope of contributing to building a serviceable toon.<br/>\n<br/>\n I probably got your reply confused with the previous topic you created.\u00a0 All these Arelith requests begin to blend together for some reason.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
