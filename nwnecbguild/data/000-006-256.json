Four attacks/ round, undispellable spell-casting, divine might and shield, both epic warding and epic mage amour, paladin immunities, tremendous saving throws and an effective divine wrath consist one of my finest creations up-to-date. There is almost nothing this battle-sorceress can't do either with her spells or with her blade and every necessary feat is there, albeit in a somewhat strict order since most of them need to be taken in a general feat level. In comparison to my \"eldritch disciple\" this one loses the ews and a couple of feats at the beginning, but her latent abilities are so much higher as to warrant the small sacrifice you are about to make. There are a couple of charismatic spell-swords like her and the best one is Xylophone's \"blessed knight of mystra\" but he doesn't have any spell-penetration feats and he miss both divine might and armour skin.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Xylophone's, Blessed knight of Mystra</strong> -&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build218329.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 18329.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#800080\"><em><strong>THE BATTLE SORCERESS</strong></em></span><br/>\n<em><strong><span style=\"color:#800080\">(SORCERESS 26/ PAL 4/ COT 10)</span></strong></em><br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://i1375.photobucket.com/albums/ag474/valerfor/BattleSorcerer_zps7b2d3232.jpg\" /><br/>\n<br/>\n RACE: Human<br/>\n ALIGNMENT: LG<br/>\n PLAYABILITY: PvM 1 \u2013 40<br/>\n<br/>\n STARTING/ ENDING STATS:<br/>\n STR -\u00a0 16 (24)<br/>\n DEX -\u00a0 08<br/>\n CON - 14<br/>\n INT -\u00a0\u00a0 12<br/>\n WIS -\u00a0 08<br/>\n CHA - 16 (20)<br/>\n<br/>\n Hit Points: 324<br/>\n<br/>\n Skill Points: 172<br/>\n Concentration: 42 (44)<br/>\n Discipline: 43 (50)<br/>\n Persuade: 8 (13)<br/>\n Spellcraft: 39 (40)<br/>\n Tumble: 20 (19) cc<br/>\n<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fort/Ref/Will): 34/ 28/ 28 \u2192 42/ 36/ 36 (saves Vs spells)<br/>\n Buffed Charisma (Fort/Ref/Will): 40/ 34/ 34 -&gt; 48/ 42/ 42 (saves Vs spells)<br/>\n<br/>\n Naked/ Armoured AC: 15/ 28 (Plate and Shield, Cat's Grace)<br/>\n Self-Buffed AC: 60 (Full plate and Shield)<br/>\n<br/>\n BAB: 26 (Four attacks)<br/>\n AB: +37/ +32/ +27/ +22 (Longsword)<br/>\n DMG: 1d8 +7/ 17 \u2013 20 x2 (Longsword)<br/>\n<br/>\n Spellcasting: Sorcerer 9th Circle of Spells (Undispellable)<br/>\n Spell Penetration: 28 +1d20 +10 (Mord's Disjunction)<br/>\n<br/>\n * Divine Shield: +5/ +11 AC<br/>\n * Divine Might: +5/ +11 Divine Dmg<br/>\n * Epic Warding: 1300 Dmg Absorption Shield, Lasts 26 Rounds<br/>\n * Epic Mage Armour: +20 total AC, Lasts 26 h, +5 Dodge AC Stacks<br/>\n * Divine Wrath: +5 AB, +5 Divine Dmg, +5 to all saves, Dmg Reduction<br/>\n<br/>\n LEVELING GUIDE:<br/>\n 01) Sorcerer (01): Power Attack, Still Spell, Pixie Familiar<br/>\n 02) Paladin (01):<br/>\n 03) Sorcerer (02): Weapon Focus: Longsword<br/>\n 04) Sorcerer (03): {CHA +1}<br/>\n 05) Sorcerer (04):<br/>\n 06) Sorcerer (05): Extend Spell<br/>\n 07) Sorcerer (06):<br/>\n 08) Paladin (02): {CHA +1}<br/>\n 09) Paladin (03): Divine Shield<br/>\n 10) Sorcerer (07):<br/>\n 11) Sorcerer (08):<br/>\n 12) Paladin (04): Divine Might, {STR +1}<br/>\n 13) CoT (01):<br/>\n 14) CoT (02): Blind Fight<br/>\n 15) CoT (03): Empower Spell<br/>\n 16) CoT (04): Knockdown, {STR +1}<br/>\n 17) CoT (05):<br/>\n 18) CoT (06): Spell Penetration, Cleave<br/>\n 19) CoT (07):<br/>\n 20) CoT (08): Improved Critical: Longsword, {STR +1}<br/>\n 21) Sorcerer (09): Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword<br/>\n 22) Sorcerer (10):<br/>\n 23) Sorcerer (11):<br/>\n 24) Sorcerer (12): Armour Skin, {STR +1}<br/>\n 25) Sorcerer (13):<br/>\n 26) Sorcerer (14):<br/>\n 27) Sorcerer (15): Great Charisma [1]<br/>\n 28) Sorcerer (16): {STR +1}<br/>\n 29) Sorcerer (17):<br/>\n 30) Sorcerer (18): Auto Still [1]<br/>\n 31) CoT (09):<br/>\n 32) Sorcerer (19): {STR +1}<br/>\n 33) Sorcerer (20): Auto Still [2]<br/>\n 34) Sorcerer (21):<br/>\n 35) Sorcerer (22):<br/>\n 36) Sorcerer (23): Auto Still [3], Epic Warding, {STR +1}<br/>\n 37) Sorcerer (24):<br/>\n 38) Sorcerer (25):<br/>\n 39) Sorcerer (26): Great Charisma [2], Epic Mage Armour<br/>\n 40) CoT (10): Epic Prowess, {STR +1}<br/>\n<br/>\n SPECIAL NOTES:<br/>\n * Smite Evil 1/Day: +5AB/ +11 AB and +14 Dmg<br/>\n * Lay on Hands: 70/ 154 Hit Points<br/>\n * Turn Undead: 8/ 14 Uses per Day<br/>\n * Immune to Fear and Disease<br/>\n * Undispellable Spell-caster<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

VJo53v-rtE</a><br/>\n<br/>\n If you ask my humble opinion, they can't do all the things the \"<strong><span style=\"color:#800080\">Battle Sorceress</span></strong>\" can do, since both builds have different focusses and certain sacrifices have to be made in builds like this (can't have all, bummer), but as far as raw power goes they are a level above her. The first one has 38 AB with Dev. Crit. to boot and the other has 40 AB and 10 more strength. You simply don't mess with the RDD's... If you like, simply think of the \"<span style=\"color:#800080\"><strong>Battle Sorceress</strong></span>\" as their little sister ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n * Mick i hope you don't mind the name mispronunciation, i simply like thew old one better :)<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Spellsword of Bahamut was the result of an attempt to improve that kind of spellswords. They are hard to do right, it is easy to go wrong and you have to stay very focused to achieve anything worthwhile.<br/>\n The end result of my process towards a better (more powerful) spellsword was so different from the Transcending Knight that I had to call it something else than \"Transcending Knight v2\" even though it in a way had transcended to something better. The theme LG paladins and dragon disciples pointed towards Bahamut and I am comfortable with that.<br/>\n I also like the old name, it implies transformation to something greater, but for the reason given above I decided to let it Rest In Peace.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The \"<strong>spellsword of bahamut</strong>\" was a general improvement though and i don't like the v.2 names either so that one was perhaps as good as it gets for a name. With these kind of builds you will never have everything you possibly want either, so you have to chose what to put inside, although the accumulated experience allowed for builds to be honed over time. With the \"<span style=\"color:#800080\"><strong>Battle Sorceress</strong></span>\" i have everything i wanted in a spell-sword build, but on the other hand she doesn't have the raw power the dragon builds do, and i cannot think a possible way to get something more from her. Ah well, all these are more on a philosophical level as in-game these builds are so versatile and powerful that it really won't matter if we never get to the perfection ;)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Me likey this build very very much, but since you use a CoT bonus feat to take that requirement, I'm curious as to what you'd drop (probably penetration line but good news is you can add maximize :D). Also, what would you add? I'd say expertise, but you lack the INT to do that. Toughness? It needs to be combat due to being a CoT feat.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I would actually advise you to do that tweak you yourself suggested and take Maximize spell, Val. Maximize spell makes it so that you can cast IGMS as a level 9 spell too, which can be quite useful in tie-ups. Plus, it gives you maneuverability over your spellbook for spending a slot 3 levels higher. Since you don't memorize anything in advance, it basically ADDS SPELLS that you need in slots that you can live without in all situations (as long as you have the spell, ofc). Much better than Spell Penetration. If you cast Mordenkainen's Disjunction, you can pierce max toolset SR.<br/>\n<br/>\n Another thing that worries me is that you have EMA AND DS, but no Uncanny Dodge, which means you LOSE all your dodge AC when flat-footed. It can be devastating depending on who you face and the rules where you play.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Max, thanks for the advice and as i said you can always select one over the other, these tweaks are always upon the player and the specific environment that he/she plays. Other might opt to even have both penetrations feats and go with onlly still and empower for spell management. It really depends on where you play bro, Lolth in WoG for example has 50 SR, so you cannot always rely on beating max toolset SR only. Single player modules are different, i would probably take maximize spell there and so on. I still think the way she is now (balanced) is the best one for general purposes though.<br/>\n<br/>\n And as for the Uncanny Dodge as Empyre said already it only protects against dexterity AC loss and not your Dodge AC or even Tumble AC, they are both gone when you are flat-footed. The best way to protect against this effect is to just play better, i explained these things amongst others, in my \"Iron Fist\" build a few days ago. I find you a little hard on a build that has 60 AC (with Concealment) totally self-buffed without any items, that goes easily to 69 AC with just boots of \"hardiness +4\" and a \"shield +5\", you don't need more with a spell-sword Max, they have other tools to take care of situations like these.<br/>\n<br/>\n a) Shapechange to Iron Golem form and let them melt themselves to your damage shields.<br/>\n<br/>\n b) Time Stop, then Greater Sanctuary and you can get out of the danger zone and return when you want, on your terms.<br/>\n<br/>\n And these are but just two of the many methods that you have to turn the battlefield in your favour. Need even more AC? Bigby's Interposing Hand and Negative Energy Burst will do that happily for you. And you will have Concealment 50% from Displacement/ Improved Invisibility as well, do not forget that.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
