      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">For those of you who enjoy playing shifters as much as I do and have found some serious limitations to the sweet Risen Lord shape, try this one on for size...<br/>\n<br/>\n The shifter Risen Lord is a mixed blessing. On one hand, it is bullet-proof and a devastating scyther. On the other, its inability to heal during combat (unless a friendly cleric has a Harm spell in queue he can spare) and ease of turning drastically alter one's dependence on it, in a general sense. So what ya gonna do? Give it some skin! *lol*<br/>\n<br/>\n Maybe this guy will fill in enough of the gaps to reach that all-purpose Risen Lord goal. I've tried to mimic all the shifter version characteristics as closely as possible. The main difference is that many must be buffed on for the human version, except for crit immunity &amp; the other PM 10 attributes and every item merges . I'll leave it to you to recognize which spells are best to provide the same coverage as there are many to help.<br/>\n<br/>\n Those which are not provided by virtue of the build are: slashing/piercing 50% immunity, whirlwind &amp; vamp regen +2.<br/>\n<br/>\n What tactics have I used so far? It's pretty straight-forward really. Just buff, set up the recipro shields and begin to wail. Even Battle Clerics have a hard time against this guy. It takes them a while to shred the mantles and while they are so engaged, there are over a dozen True Strikes slotted to make sure the scythe doesn't miss very often. If they prefer to hack away with divine empowerment, even better... a quicker and more merciful death. Seldom will any attacker last more than a few rounds if they can't dispel the shields.<br/>\n<br/>\n High level mages, especially spellswords, have been the most difficult so they need to be perceived quickly, Gtr Sanctuary-sneaked and IKD'd or Time-Stopped so the distance can be closed quickly before they can set up their epic warding and equally dangerous recipro shields. On scythe crits, there will plenty of damage to overcome even the higher soaks and their crits won't land.<br/>\n<br/>\n Tanking<br/>\n The shapechanges will also help to boost the HPs way up but will suffer AB quite a bit (and with no TrS! ). So these I save for tanking purposes working best in a party of artillery classes. Even Tenser's performs exceptionally well when hasted and surrounded by mantles and recipro shields. For those ornery green ancients, cast Epic Warding after a shapechange (only unarmed, not Tenser's) and it will cut through +20 DR and along with the exalted HPs will allow time for the non-acid recipro (39/hit) to have its effect synchronized with the melee attack.<br/>\n<br/>\n This build really doesn't have enough wiz levels to be considered a reliable spellcaster so I have limited the damage spell repertoire to most of the Bigby's, Isaac's Missiles, Magic Missile, Ice Storm, Vampiric Touch, Power Word: Kill and Darkness (for control)... all the \"No Save\" spells. I tried focusing in Evocation or Necromancy but it was still pretty wimpy going from a 15 DC to a 21 DC. Meh. Not a good choice IMO. But the spell penetration is decent with Epic Spell Pen so I am sticking with that.<br/>\n<br/>\n Did I mention he can open most locks, disable, recover and set all traps (No... not Epics!) without breaking Greater Sanctuary? Doesn't really need the pixie except for scouting and the pixie refuses to set traps. Just hovers and makes a twinkling sound if you ask her real nice. But she will give her life to spring those epic ones for me... Sweet dumb little fairy.<br/>\n<br/>\n PROS/CONS: The only CON that seems to be noticeable is the 3 APR (4 APR hasted). But it's a wizard with indispellable buffs and crit immunity so that's about the best you'll get with this design. Use Keen Edge to crit as often as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n Comment about Armor &amp; AC in this build<br/>\n The set-up shown is how it is being played now. However, to some degree, it is counter-productive to take the Still Spell feats to use heavy armor which raises the AC over 40. That means it will get hit less often and that is NOT what you want for good recipro damage. Can't do anything about the AC from PM but removing Tumble AC and wearing robes will help and also free up 4 feats (higher AB and/or combat feats like Cleave/Disarm, etc.). Before the acid sheath reaches high levels, the recipro isn't quite as reliable so it is a Catch-22 deal. Pay me now or pay me later<br/>\n<br/>\n I hope some of you decide to give this build a whirl because I would love to hear your own experience on your favorite server.<br/>\n And, of course, brutal dissection will be happily received!<br/>\n<br/>\n Most similar ECB builds posted:<br/>\n Grizz's High-CON Recipro build: along the same lines but totally geared towards reciprocal damage shields and support spells; a better caster.<br/>\n Megaiti's DevCrit Spellsword: also uses heavy armor like the Corporeal RL but dispellable.<br/>\n The rest using this combo are either an AC hound or pure caster... not what I am trying to formulate.<br/>\n<br/>\n Wizard 24/Pale Master 10/Barbarian 6, Human, Non Lawful/Non Good<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 16 (30)<br/>\n DEX: 8<br/>\n CON: 16<br/>\n WIS: 8<br/>\n INT: 16 (20)<br/>\n CHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n HP: 366<br/>\n Saves (F/W/R): 25/21/14 (34/30/23 vs. spells)<br/>\n Other save bonuses: Traps: +1<br/>\n BAB: 22<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 36 (melee), 22 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 15/23<br/>\n<br/>\n Changes from Wiz 24/PM 10/Ftr 6 - Overview<br/>\n PRO<br/>\n AB +3<br/>\n PM Crit protection pre-epic<br/>\n Better overall saves<br/>\n Taunt ability<br/>\n CON<br/>\n Base HPs -28<br/>\n Late spellcasting progression<br/>\n Loss of heavy armor prof &amp; casting failure with any armor<br/>\n Some feat starvation/limitation<br/>\n<br/>\n General Comments<br/>\n A robed-variant of the former Corporeal RL build. Sticking to fighter without late PM dump left the character much less skilled and half-deaf (crossclass Listen only) so Barbarian was inserted. Loss of +6 EWS but damage wasn't much of an issue. The resultant feat starvation (less 3 ftr bonus feats) resulted in the removal of Toughness although the barb levels and rage more than compensated for that issue (-40 Toughness + 12 barb6 + 80 rage = net +52 HPs). Rage boosts the build potential very well and will last a full turn if buffed with Emp Endurance beforehand.<br/>\n<br/>\n Overall, AC is much reduced but with damage shields intact, this is actually a benefit since the enemies will miss less. Also, the addition of taunting presents an additional method to control those pesky casters that are the real bane of this kind of build. The early levels need to played mostly as a standard melee mage until the damage shields are available since spellcasting power development is interrupted by Pale Master levels. By level 26 all damage shields are available in extended form so mobs can be controlled well enough from that point onward.<br/>\n<br/>\n Saves have improved slightly and shapechange forms are much better (Rage can be activated during polymorph as can Epic Warding and any combat modes).<br/>\n<br/>\n IMO a much superior build without attempting to accommodate the use of armor.<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Brb 1 - Wpn Prof Exotic, Blind Fight<br/>\n 02: Wiz 1 - School: Illusion<br/>\n 03: Wiz 2 - Silent Spell<br/>\n 04: Wiz 3 - INT+1 (17)<br/>\n 05: Wiz 4 - Extend Spell<br/>\n 06: Wiz 5 - Wpn Focus: Scythe, Extend Spell<br/>\n 07: Brb 2<br/>\n 08: Brb 3 - STR+1 (17)<br/>\n 09: Brb 4 - Knockdown<br/>\n 10: PM 1<br/>\n 11: PM 2<br/>\n 12: PM 3 - STR+1 (18), Imp Knockdown<br/>\n 13: PM 4<br/>\n 14: PM 5<br/>\n 15: PM 6 - Empower Spell<br/>\n 16: PM 7 - STR+1 (19)<br/>\n 17: PM 8<br/>\n 18: PM 9 - Imp Crit: Scythe<br/>\n 19: PM 10<br/>\n 20: Brb 5 - STR+1 (20)<br/>\n 21: Wiz 6 - Epic Wpn Focus: Scythe<br/>\n 22: Wiz 7<br/>\n 23: Wiz 8<br/>\n 24: Wiz 9 - STR+1 (21), Epic Prowess<br/>\n 25: Wiz 10 - Grt Int I (18)<br/>\n 26: Wiz 11<br/>\n 27: Wiz 12 - Grt Str I, (22)<br/>\n 28: Wiz 13 - STR+1, (23)<br/>\n 29: Wiz 14<br/>\n 30: Wiz 15 - Grt Str II (24), Grt Int II (19)<br/>\n 31: Wiz 16<br/>\n 32: Wiz 17 - STR+1 (25)<br/>\n 33: Wiz 18 - Grt Str III, (26)<br/>\n 34: Wiz 19<br/>\n 35: Wiz 20 - Grt Int III (20)<br/>\n 36: Wiz 21 - STR+1 (27), Grt Str IV (28)<br/>\n 37: Wiz 22<br/>\n 38: Wiz 23 - Epic Warding<br/>\n 39: Wiz 24 - Grt Str V (29)<br/>\n 40: Brb 6 - STR+1 (30)<br/>\n<br/>\n SKILLS: 296<br/>\n Concentration 42(45), Disable Trap 5(12), Discipline 43(53), Listen 43(42), Open Lock 1(0), Search 5(10),<br/>\n Set Trap 21(22), Spellcraft 42(47), Taunt 43(42), remaining 19<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: DTrap(2), Disc(4), List(4), Locks(1), Srch(1), STrap(1), Taunt(4), S - 10<br/>\n 02: Conc(5), Spcr(5), S - 6<br/>\n 03: Conc(1), Srch(1), STrap(1), Spcr(1), S - 6<br/>\n 04: Conc(1), Spcr(1), S - 10<br/>\n 05: Conc(1), Srch(1), STrap(1), Spcr(1), S - 10<br/>\n 06: Conc(1), Spcr(1), S - 14<br/>\n 07: Disc(6), List(6), Srch(1), STrap(1), Taunt(6)<br/>\n 08: DTrap(2), Disc(1), List(1), Taunt(1), S - 1<br/>\n 09: Disc(1), List(1), STrap(1), Taunt(1), S - 4<br/>\n 10: Conc(4), List(1), Spcr(4), S - 1<br/>\n 11: Conc(1), DTrap(1), List(1), Srch(1), Spcr(1)<br/>\n 12: Conc(1), List(1), Spcr(1), S - 3<br/>\n 13: Conc(1), List(1), STrap(1), Spcr(1), S - 4<br/>\n 14: Conc(1), List(1), Spcr(1), S - 7<br/>\n 15: Conc(1), List(1), STrap(1), Spcr(1), S - 8<br/>\n 16: Conc(1), List(1), Spcr(1), S - 11<br/>\n 17: Conc(1), List(1), STrap(1), Spcr(1), S - 12<br/>\n 18: Conc(1), List(1), Spcr(1), S - 15<br/>\n 19: Conc(1), List(1), STrap(1), Spcr(1), S - 16<br/>\n 20: Disc(11), List(1), Taunt(11), S - 1<br/>\n 21: Conc(2), STrap(1), Spcr(2), S - 1<br/>\n 22: Conc(1), Spcr(1), S - 5<br/>\n 23: Conc(1), STrap(2), Spcr(1), S - 5<br/>\n 24: Conc(1), Spcr(1), S - 9<br/>\n 25: Conc(1), STrap(2), Spcr(1), S - 9<br/>\n 26: Conc(1), Spcr(1), S - 14<br/>\n 27: Conc(1), STrap(1), Spcr(1), S - 17<br/>\n 28: Conc(1), Spcr(1), S - 22<br/>\n 29: Conc(1), STrap(1), Spcr(1), S - 25<br/>\n 30: Conc(1), Spcr(1), S - 30<br/>\n 31: Conc(1), STrap(1), Spcr(1), S - 33<br/>\n 32: Conc(1), Spcr(1), S - 38<br/>\n 33: Conc(1), STrap(1), Spcr(1), S - 41<br/>\n 34: Conc(1), Spcr(1), S - 46<br/>\n 35: Conc(1), STrap(1), Spcr(1), S - 49<br/>\n 36: Conc(1), Spcr(1), S - 55<br/>\n 37: Conc(1), STrap(1), Spcr(1), S - 59<br/>\n 38: Conc(1), Spcr(1), S - 65<br/>\n 39: Conc(1), STrap(1), Spcr(1), S - 69<br/>\n 40: Disc(20), List(20), Taunt(20), remaining - 19<br/>\n<br/>\n CRUNCH @Level 40<br/>\n<br/>\n AB (&amp;

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hey Hip,<br/>\n<br/>\nI took a look at this build, and it looks good, but I do think a couple of tweaks are in order to solve the 2 main problems of this build:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- You should anticipate PM levels if your strategy is to let the mobs kill themselves. With your lowish AC, critical immunity will come in handy earlier. You could leave Fighter 6 to get at level 40, as IMO EWS, although nice to have, is not as important as critical immunity for your battle strategy.<br/>\n<br/>\n2- By anticipating PM to pre-epics, you can go Fighter 5 Wizard 5 PM 10 and end up with the same pre-epic BAB you already have. That means you will have to drop 3 pre-epic feats, which to me would be Silent Spell, Still Spell and one more (trying not to mess with the penetration feats here, but IMO they're droppable too). Then you can also drop Auto-still line and you'll free up 6 feats to up your STR modifier by taking Great Intelligence with the Wizard 10, Wizard 15 and Wizard 20 Bonus Feats. That will result in +3 AB and damage at the cost of AC. Your AB is quite low, so I think that this tweak is in order. That will have the side effect of delaying your Wizard casting prowess and Epic Warding for 3 levels, but you can't have it all. Having critical immunity for 20+ levels is more important to this guy than EW for 3 IMO.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, it's a good offensive tank build .<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I think it is useful to almost anyone, but my bias aside, I still think I have a point worth thinking about.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you IKD someone then they arent hitting your damage shields. The only reason you want them like this is to drink heals or cast spells or something, no? IE is a reliable help in these situations while IKD won't help you against 2 or more attackers.  I'd say the ability to adjust your AC in combat at will is extremely useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a thought *grin*<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The recipro damage will not be the normal one-hit kill because no one will be getting crits... just whittling them down a bit until I can get to them in their turn.  It's simply meant to be a mob-control tactic while the rest of the party (ideally, artillery types) assaults those silly enough to converge on him.  So the IKD is the mainstay of the build to immobilize one target at a time and dispose of it without interruptions. It has been extremely effective so far and rather easy to level.  I really wanted to remove DevCrit as a potential threat because I have been besieged by mobs of those guys lately.  And the epic warding will prevent things from getting out of hand against especially pesky high AB, high damage types.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is cheesy to negate the AC factor, Shia, but I never claimed otherwise. :S<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
