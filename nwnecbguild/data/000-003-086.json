But, I'm trying to make a caster caster. I figured Paladin would help with saves, considering the sorcerer himself would have horrendous AC (I think) I know a little bit of AC xD Little. I mean.. it's kinda like 'I like the concept' But, the warrior was the melee, and this one is the ranged focus. Not entirely sure if that's the good way of sayin it. You know, I kinda figure if someone gets you into melee as a caster (If they are built for melee) It might just be game over. ...That and alongside my sword and shield I felt like making myself a spell slinging... guy? They made some recent changes with GSF: Evo granting infinite magic missile. GSF: CONJ getting Acid Arrow, etc. So, ...yeah xD Just thought I'd make a spell guy thing, ...I'm rambling aren't I? Sorry about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n As for the original request. I was messin' around in the forums tryin' stuff out.Then, it just up and disappeared when I refreshed. I don't think I ended up deleting it by mistake.. Kinda why I made this thread since the other was gone. Figured something happened on the forum end, or I'm an idiot and did something by mistake xD. Only 2 options I see.. unless someone else deleted it in which case. That makes 3. o.o<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You know, with the majority focus on spellcasting (Evo) But, I guess the was it Tenser? Might be.. a decent..ish fallout plan if..spells don't work or.. some other random stuff. How would you build it? (Assuming the SF and GSF were both chosen on level 1? Due to getting an 'unlimited' version of a spell so I can deal damage, and spam summons?) I don't know how well discipline would help, but I agree.. that getting someone to KD spam me into oblivion wouldn't be the prettiest sight. PvM or PvP wise. So, would you help me figure out how to make it work? If it comes in later like you said would there need to be 4 paladin levels, or just 3 taken way late in the build?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Yes, I understand. I will do my best to avoid doing that from now on. I didn't realise that was an issue that was occurring, but now I am aware of it.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It won't be much help from my part, but it might make things easier for them to decide which spell focus might fit them. I'm with Hip though, I prefer the extra spell feats, though I can't say I've ever tried a wizard/rogue. Hope this helps you pick out which SF you want. I cannot give you any recommendations. A Sorcerer has to be picky, you don't get the extra feats.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, to kinda roll off topic for my own knowledge. What sort of benefits to wizards gain by taking rogue levels?

How much do you figure they lose in return?<br/>\n<br/>\n CLASS CHANGES - SORCERER/WIZARD<br/>\n<br/>\n Sorcerers and Wizards now gain innate abilities that can be cast infinitely when selecting a greater spell focus. These abilities are as follows:<br/>\n * GSF Abjuration grants Endure Elements.<br/>\n * GSF Conjuration grants Melf's Acid Arrow.<br/>\n * GSF Divination grants See Invisibility.<br/>\n * GSF Enchantment grants Blindness/Deafness.<br/>\n * GSF Evocation grants Magic Missile.<br/>\n * GSF Illusion grants Color Spray.<br/>\n * GSF Necromancy grants Ray of Enfeeblement.
