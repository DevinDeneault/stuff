Before that, all additional attacks were made at full AB not just the DP one.  Since v1.69, the extra attacks (like from DP, haste, rapid shot, flurry) all follow the normal progression -5, -10, -15... even if using the monk -3 progression.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout those vamps... how would a Risen Lord hold up against them?</div>"

It has 15 levels of cleric and can kick butt in melee while still able to use all wizard spells. You can, for example, cast Time Stop, True Strike, then Heal (I assume it's unmodified) to leave them with 1d4 HPs and finish them off with IGMS.</div>"

Still have it on my hard drive though.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo cleric 15/Rogue 1/CoT 4 preepic to get 15 BAB and use DP's power to the fullest. Start at 1st lvl with rogue for extra skillpoints and early UMD. You might even go Cleric 14/Rogue 2 preepic. Hellball and one epic save booster might be swapped for two Great Str and so can EP and the other epic save booster for a grand total of +1 AB and +2 Dev Crit DC.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, if you are looking into the epitome of buff and melee str based battle cleric with umd access then go no further than Cleric 26/Bard 4/RDD 10. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor vampire killing I'd actually look into a turner/caster cleric. Mass heal them right from the start and then finish them off with a firestorm.</div>"
