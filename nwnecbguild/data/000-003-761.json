      "content": "<div>This was a fun build idea I came up with having dinner<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman Bard / Pale Master<br/>\n<br/>\nPMs suffer from low AB. So try to find a way to boost it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nRDD would do it but one would have 3 APR / round.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo see if Weapon Master can work<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapon options sadly limited to simple weapons so I went for the Spear, the best of the bunch, with a x3 crit modifier (increased to x4 modifier with weapon master)<br/>\n<br/>\nBit rough to pack everything in. A PM build just doesn't feel complete without at least 16 levels for EMA/EW<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it looks pretty good actually. Base AB 42, +23 to AC (from tumble / PM bonuses / EMA), Crit and Sneak Immune, there's a lot in here to like.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel Bard 4 spells are a bonus, I could have squeezed an extra feat in by dumping it, but didn't feel like it, sadly a lot of buffs are gonna be dispelled but at least they blow their spells to get rid of your improved invisibility, and there are heaps of medium armors with reduced arcane spell failure probably meaning spell casting in combat is likely going to be possible with this build in many environments<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one has trouble hitting one can use Bard Song &amp; Taunt em\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThought I would share it with the guild, see what you think<br/>\n<br/>\nI could have dropped toughness for improved knockdown or improved critical but I thought a bit more HP might be good for a frontline Melee'er. I could have dropped Dex and Int to 13 and put Cons to 12 for nearly 400hp but I thought the build would benefit from the skill points.\u00a0<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Bard(11), Weapon Master(13), Pale Master(16), Human\nSTR: 16 (30)\nCON: 10\nINT: 14\n\n01: Bard(1): Dodge, Expertise\n03: Bard(3): Weapon Focus: Spear\n05: Pale Master(2)\n07: Pale Master(4)\n09: Bard(5): Spring Attack\n11: Bard(7)\n13: Weapon Master(1): Weapon of Choice: Spear\n15: Weapon Master(3): Blind Fight\n17: Weapon Master(5)\n19: Weapon Master(7)\n21: Pale Master(5): Epic Weapon Focus: Spear\n23: Pale Master(6)\n25: Pale Master(8)\n27: Pale Master(10): Great Strength I, (STR=23)\n29: Weapon Master(10)\n31: Pale Master(12)\n33: Weapon Master(11): Great Strength III, (STR=27)\n35: Pale Master(15)\n37: Bard(10)\n39: Weapon Master(13): Great Strength IV, Epic Prowess, (STR=29)\n\nSkillpoints: 243\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +7\nAB (max, naked): 42 (melee), 29 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Bard(4)\n\n\n01: Discipline(4), Intimidate(2), Listen(4), Open Lock(1), Perform(1), Taunt(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(1),\u00a0\n03: Discipline(1), Intimidate(1), Perform(2), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n05: Intimidate(1), Listen(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n07: Save(14),\u00a0\n09: Discipline(1), Listen(3), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n11: Discipline(1), Listen(3), Taunt(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1),\u00a0\n13: Discipline(1), Listen(2), Save(2),\u00a0\n15: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(8),\u00a0\n17: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(14),\u00a0\n19: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(20),\u00a0\n21: Listen(1), Save(27),\u00a0\n23: Listen(1), Spellcraft(4),\u00a0\n25: Listen(1), Spellcraft(4),\u00a0\n27: Spellcraft(4), Save(1),\u00a0\n29: Discipline(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n31: Spellcraft(4), Save(1),\u00a0\n33: Save(11),\u00a0\n35: Save(21),\u00a0\n37: Taunt(15), Tumble(15), UMD(3),\u00a0\n39: Discipline(5),\u00a0</details></div>"

      "content": "<div>Thanks for the comment Grimnir!<br/>\n<br/>\nI did a PM 4 Bard 8 WM 8 split pre-epic. It's really designed to try to minimise as much Bard as possible to squeeze in as much PM and WM levels into the build, whilst preserving BAB 26+ for four attacks / round. With that design concept of minimising Bard in mind WM7 -&gt; WM8 kind of increases the BAB by 1 and overall AB by 1 (ie compared with a PM5 Bard 8 WM 7 split, for example)<br/>\n<br/>\nIncreasing WM from WM 8 to WM 13 grants 2 extra AB (1 AB from epic prowess as a bonus epic feat), to achieve that AB increase the build would need 4 great strengths (point taken it also increases damage and other stuff) but that small looking amount of AB is actually a big deal and very helpful<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't mind the Bard 14 / PM 10 / WM 16 or Bard 11 / PM 10 / WM 19 splits, they have crit/sneak immunity and a higher AB,\u00a0but there is something special about PM 16, having both EMA and EW, along with the +4 AC from PM10-&gt;16, the character just feels like a beast.<br/>\n<br/>\nPM 20 and PM 24 are even better but harder to squeeze everything in whilst maintaining 4 APR.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI could do a Bard 8 WM 16 PM 16 split it would grant at least +1 AB and a feat but I would lose the late skill dumps into Tumble / UMD / Taunt.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thanks for the suggestion. The class combinations are kind of rough. Your suggested class splits have a lot higher AB but yeah I like EMA and EW and all that PM AC goodness, happy to get +9 AC (from +4 PM AC and +5 from EMA) from PM 10-&gt;16</div>"
