      "content": "<div>G'day all,\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Starmage is a follow on from the Bard/Ftr/CoT build I was thinking about. The idea is a heavily armoured Dwarf, a Morningstar and full Wizard buffs. I checked both the databases and I couldn't see an equivalent build.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAmshell Kerak is the closest: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build281190.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/buil ... 81190.html</a> but with an emphasis on a Greatsword and the majority of wizard levels are post level 20. It also uses Tumble, whereas the Starmage uses Spring Attack. It also has epic damage reduction, but that doesn't help against elemental damage. I also prefer the potential for extra abilities or immunities from having a shield and a one handed weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\n\u00a0Once the still spell feat is achieved the Starmage will roleplay as an armoured caster. To compensate for this self-imposed liability, it was decided to invest in a specialist school.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe City of Melnibone PW has no xp penalty for scribe scroll, brew potion and craft wand and the gold costs have been reduced as well. However the base items are random drops, which are increased if you have 6 points in Craft Armour or Craft Weapon. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis build is designed as a warrior first. He'll buff up, but if he get's dispelled, he can either re-buff, retreat or just beat the living daylights out of him/her/it! Alternatively he can whip out a wand of lesser spell breach [or your favourite 1-4th level wizard spell here] and then go medieval with a pointy ball (piercing or bludgeoning damage).<br/>\n<br/>\n\u00a0High hit points, Spot, Spellcraft, Discipline, Concentration and some damage reduction also add to the defences.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe primary downside is lower AB, which I am hoping to compensate for by using buffs. I may also swap out Expertise for Knockdown.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance for your thoughts and suggestions :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Illusionist(18), Fighter(8), Dwarven Defender(14), Dwarf\nSTR: 16 (24)\nCON: 16 (18)\nINT: 14 (19)\n\u00a0\n01: Fighter(1): Dodge, Weapon Focus: Morning Star\n03: Fighter(2): Blind Fight, Power Attack\n05: Fighter(3)\n07: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Morning Star\n09: Fighter(5): Cleave\n11: Illusionist(5): Craft Wand\n13: Fighter(6): Spring Attack\n15: Dwarven Defender(3): Still Spell\n17: Dwarven Defender(4)\n19: Dwarven Defender(6)\n21: Fighter(7): Epic Weapon Focus: Morning Star\n23: Illusionist(9)\n25: Dwarven Defender(7)\n27: Illusionist(11): Epic Will\n29: Dwarven Defender(9)\n31: Illusionist(13)\n33: Dwarven Defender(11): Great Strength I, (STR=21)\n35: Illusionist(16)\n37: Dwarven Defender(12)\n39: Illusionist(18): Great Strength III, (STR=23)\n\u00a0\nSkillpoints: 195\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9, Traps: +1, Poison: +2\nAB (max, naked): 36 (melee), 28 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Wizard(9)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n01: Craft Armor(4), Discipline(4), Heal(2), Lore(2), Search(2), \n03: Discipline(2), Lore(2), \n05: Discipline(2), Heal(2), \n07: Craft Armor(2), Discipline(2), \n09: Discipline(2), Save(2), \n11: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(2), \n13: Discipline(3), Lore(1), \n15: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spot(2), \n17: Discipline(2), Listen(1), Spot(3), \n19: Discipline(1), Listen(1), Spot(2), \n21: Concentration(2), Discipline(2), \n23: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(2), \n25: Discipline(2), Listen(1), Spot(2), \n27: Concentration(2), Lore(1), Spellcraft(2), \n29: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Listen(1), Lore(1), Spot(2), \n31: Concentration(2), Lore(1), Spellcraft(2), \n33: Discipline(2), Heal(1), Listen(1), Spot(1), \n35: Concentration(2), Lore(2), Spellcraft(2), \n37: Concentration(2), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Lore(1), Spot(2), \n39: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Spellcraft(2), Save(1), \n</details></div>"

Invest in what you like, but I suggest keeping Discipline max'd and Heal at modified 15 ranks (for cure disease/poison).<br/>\nIt gets crit immunity and DR 12/- on top of Premonition and Auto Still Spell and un-dispel-ability.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe second build trends towards what this avenue is seeking: a combination of powerful/over-powered abilities rolled into one sweet package.<br/>\nIn this case, it's: crit immunity + EDR III + Auto Still Spell III + un-dispel-abilty<br/>\n<br/>\nBiggest weaknesses: High caster level druids. Super AB Arcane Archers.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you wanted something more offensive oriented, I might recommend seeing if you could squeeze Dev Crit into the build, but that's tougher with a wizard build.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Thanks Ten Pura,<br/>\n<br/>\nI like the the Dispellable Defender - that is a cool build :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the tip, I have changed the weapon focus to Longsword. I've also removed Listen and invested those skill points into Spot and Spellcraft, both now at 40 ranks.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also going to see if I can fit the Spell penetration feats into the build. Mobility, Spring Attack and an epic feat will likely have to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n*edit* I've added in the Spell penetration feats. I've also made some of the +INT ability modifiers earlier, which added skill points.<br/>\n<br/>\n\u00a0EDR was very tempting, but I feel the character needs strength to make up for 16 BAB at level 20. However I'll look at it EDR again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should have clarified that Dev crit is not an option for the PW I play on. The Palemaster build is great, but too much wizard for me.</div>"

I also moved INT even earlier for more skill points. I also moved Epic Will and Epic Reflexes to pre-20 (obviously Lightning Reflexes and Iron Will) and added Extend Spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou build also solidified the role of my build, which is a Warrior first. I envisage a Warrior with a Spell Mantle, Mind Blank, Elemental protection, Stoneskin, Tenser's, damage shields; whatever is appropriate for the circumstances. If the Boss has disepllable magical protection, then spells will be cast to strip them. The Boss may do the same to me, but then I'll be in melee range by then.</div>"
