      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hello guys,<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, i thought i\u2019d try again to play this game. I have tried before, i have the game a long time (it\u2019s NWN:EE), but i never got farther than chapter 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is i\u2019m a perfectionist when it comes to character building. I play and develop a char and if somewhere on the way i understand that my char is not the best i can get, i just lose interest in the game itself. I am not an RP\u2019er, i like to build very powerful chars that roll almost everything in their path, so i can just enjoy the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow to the specifics. Please help me find a build that would suit my play style. Here is what i have in mind:<br/>\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The char is mainly for OC and the DLC\u2019s. So the level cap would be 28, as i understand. After that i might get it for a ride in other modules that would get it to 40, if i\u2019ll like the char.<br/>\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I want to play solo, i don\u2019t like henchmen and companions (i just want all the xp for myself and i hate to micromanage). I might use one for a little bit when i am too weak, but i don;t want to rely on them for too long.<br/>\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I prefer elfs, but it\u2019s not at all important, if another race suits better the build, i\u2019ll pick that instead.<br/>\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I don\u2019t really have a class preference, but I always liked archers the most in other games. As I understand, archers are a bit lacking in the area of AoE in NWN, which gets to the next point<br/>\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The build should have some AoE potential, to kill fast weaker monsters.<br/>\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I hate to micromanage, so I don\u2019t like builds that have to buff before each fight. I can cast long lasting buffs (like an 100 rounds song, for example), I can buff before an important fight, but having to buff before every fight would kill the game for me.<br/>\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I don\u2019t really have weapon preferences, I don\u2019t care about what armor to wear, I don\u2019t care which type of magic to cast etc.<br/>\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I want my char to be as powerful as possible, as soon as possible. I can grind a little, if it\u2019s needed for the build to shine later, but I am not willing to grind 40 levels J. <br/>\n-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If it\u2019s not a caster, I\u2019d like to not have to click to many buttons, it should work as passively as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, form my little understanding of the game, seeing how archers would get annoying to deal with weak monsters, I guess I need either a caster, or a melee build. If you happen to know archer builds that can deal with the crowd efficiently, please let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it\u2019s a caster, I\u2019d like to be focusing on offensive spells. I\u2019d try a sorcerer, but I don\u2019t know what and when to add to the mix, to squeeze the maximum out of the char.<br/>\nThank you in advance for your help and sorry for my bad English, it\u2019s not my first language.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi Dlightfull, and welcome!<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore we dismiss archers completely, the Arcane Archer class can be ridiculously powerful. Have a look at Mick Dagger's guide to the class in the Game Guides section for all the details. It's restricted to elves and half-elves, and you need at least 1 level of either Bard/ Sorcerer/ Wizard. That means the earliest you can start to take the class is level 8 (essentially, the end of chapter 1 of the OC, so you'd be spending that chapter building up to it), because you need a BAB of +6. If you're looking to take out weak mobs early, at level 2 AA gets the imbue arrow feat, so 3 times a day you can shoot a 10d6 fireball, which should help.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, have a read and a think.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
