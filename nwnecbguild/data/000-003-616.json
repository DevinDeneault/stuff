      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"><em class=\"mention\">@Sucy</em>\u00a0I am going to drop two Protection Healer builds in here for your review.\u00a0 You can read more about the healer path <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Cleric#Healer\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HERE</a><br/>\nThe quick summary, they are limited to cloth armour and simple weapons but in exchange get some advanced healing powers and a cleric version of timestop called respite that does not stop time so much as remove you and your party from it briefly before returning you somewhat restored.\u00a0 It is a class designed around using extended regeneration to feed another class skill called over healing.\u00a0 A 30th level healer can \"overheal\" up to 150 hp.\u00a0 Meaning they drop an extended regen on someone/something/themselves and that thing ticks up to 150 temporary HP and stays there as long as the Regen holds.\u00a0 On a server where most 30th level characters have 300-400 HP this is the single largest HP buff in the game.\u00a0 They have lots of other healing enhancements, it is worth a read/review of the link.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn Arelith, outside of Speciality builds like this one the Domain order of power is: Travel (Haste) &gt; War &gt; Trickery/Plant/Death &gt; everything else.\u00a0 So a Battle Cleric should be Travel/War a Caster Cleric should be Travel/War.\u00a0 This is niche build however and we trade Travel (Haste) for Autoquicken + Protection.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll offer two builds.\u00a0 Your largest issue I think will be a deity that closely matches the Priestess.\u00a0 \"Earth Mother\" Deities will likely all be druidish plant/animal/water/fire/air/earth style domains which are very un-optimal for this build and frankly for any Cleric/Healer build on Arelith.\u00a0 You will need Protection, the other Domain is more flexible.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Build 1:</span></strong><br/>\nProtection/War Domain: This is my recommended build for mechanical strength on Arelith and also seems to fit what I read about the character.<br/>\nThis build has two focuses:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Protection Feat: Greater Sanctuary on Arelith has been reduced drastically in duration, it lasts Caster Level/4 rounds with a cool down of 240 seconds.\u00a0 So, an Extended Greater Sanctuary will last 15 Rounds for a level 30 caster.\u00a0 The Protection Feat is a Buffed up Sanctuary which, in this build, will last 43 Rounds.\u00a0 You can cast all non-offensive spells whilst under this effect including summons (which break GSanc on Arelith), buffs and heals (used non-offensively).\u00a0 Meaning you can enter the Protection Feat Sanctuary and be effectively immune from combat (Area of Effect can still impact you) for the duration of a PvP or PvE battle.\u00a0 You will also be near impossible to see/find as True Sight is the only thing that can locate you (but does not allow targetting you) and Truesight has been changed to 1 round for the \"True sight effect\" and there are no \"True Sight\" items.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe War Feat: This grants you access to Aura of Vitality (The Awesomesauce) as well as Cat's Grace (a bonus).\u00a0 Aura of Vitality (AoV), when cast by a caster with ESF: Transmutation is Turns/Level.\u00a0 ESF: Transmutation also increases the effect of Animal spells (Bulls, Owls, Cats, Etc ..) from 1d4+1 to 1d4+3.\u00a0 Meaning, that with AoV and the Animal Spells, you can almost reach the stat cap bonus for Str/Dex/Con.\u00a0 This is exceedingly useful for buffing your summons, your party and yourself and makes your equipment exceedingly flexible.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Cleric(30), Human\nSTR: 8\nCON: 12\nINT: 14\n\n01: Cleric(1): Spell Focus: Conjuration, Greater Spell Focus: Conjuration, Domain War,

Spellcraft(1), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n</details>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Build 2:</span></strong><br/>\nProtection/Heal Domains:\u00a0 This is a healing focused build that doubles down on the healing aspect of the healer.\u00a0 I generally find with the spontaneous healing changes to include Heal, Mass Heal and Healing Circle and the radius increase for Healing Circle and Mass Heal the Healer has a tremendous amount of healing and doubling down on it is more redundancy than improvement.\u00a0 This build packs more than enough healing capability without spending a Domain on Healing.\u00a0 The one exception to this might be group PvP if that is the character focus.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe build for this can be found <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mxW1XakMTTdqdEVDM7IuYIOARZMmKUCDgpBJuIOqjY4/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Here</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI recommend 3 modifications to this build if you go this route:<br/>\n1. In the build notes they mention taking Extend rather than Silent Spell.\u00a0 Silent Spell is added for spellbook slot management purposes.\u00a0 I have run this build and found that Extend offers far more usefulness on Arelith than Silent, especially given that spontaneous healing has been extended to include heal, mass heal and healing circle.\u00a0 I strongly recommend taking Extend Spell over Silent Spell.<br/>\n2. Mummy Dust very likely does not fit the character RP, I would replace this feat with Scribe Scroll.\u00a0 This offers two things, the first is a way to carry around more spells.\u00a0 I would Craft a stack of Mass heals and heals.\u00a0 It also offers Tier 3 DweomerCraft for the maximum enchant item ability another exceedingly useful thing to have on a build.<br/>\n3. Last but not least, this is an old build from before the big UMD/Lore change that has now linked cross class scroll usage with Lore.\u00a0 Take 12 Con and 14 Int to start and drop 33 points into Lore.\u00a0 If you also choose to swap out Toughness you can fit Scribe Scroll as a Toughness replacement and ESF: Lore as the Mummy Dust Replacement.\u00a0 This, with some equipment and max lore skill will allow this build to hit 80 Lore.\u00a0 80 Lore will allow you to use Timestop and Mords Disjunction scrolls as a pure 30 healer which is an immense power boost and doubles your defensive arsenal.\u00a0\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I have taken a focus in transmutation as a druid player to improve the DC of the drown and entangle spells, although I found this not to be as high yield as other spell foci such as conjuration/necromancy for druids.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway just some questions from someone keen to learn a bit more how to build for Arelith!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Absolutely, this is some of both the most interesting and the most frustrating bits of Arelith to be honest.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach of the spell Foci lines has been adjusted to provide strong secondary benefits which have rapidly also become the primary benefit of those foci.<br/>\n<br/>\nGSF: Conjuration offers a summon tier increase similar to the animal domain benefit. \u00a0Arelith has a tier X and tier XI summons. \u00a0Tier XI is limited to wild Mages as the Conjuration benefit and Animal do not stack from a Tier bonus perspective. \u00a0ESF: Conjuration also offers a summon PC feat called yoink.<br/>\n<br/>\nGSF and ESF Transmutation offer +1 and then +2 to animal spells and singular teleport and then group teleport. \u00a0They also offer increases in AoV duration (turns per level at ESF).<br/>\n<br/>\nAbjuration offers a couple of things, Each level offers an increase of +1 to dispels with ESF offering +2. \u00a0Dispel cap has been increased as well on Arelith, with Abjuration you get a 26 cap. \u00a0At GSF, immunity to ILMS and at ESF, immunity to IGMS in conjunction with a shield spell. \u00a0ESF also offers a ward feat preventing scrying (A Divination ESF ability), prevents teleports (Transmutation ability), getting yoinked (Conjuration ability) and offering a will saved brief paralysis for anything hostile entering.<br/>\n<br/>\nAbjuration Defence: Abjuration offers a +2 CL for resisting dispels.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, the focus of the healer build is to stand behind something/someone and heal/buff it. \u00a0Summons get CL level bonuses AND spell foci bonuses, Conjuration for anything not undead and Necromancy for Undead. \u00a0This makes a deep Caster summoner very viable for end game content. \u00a0My healer has fought to and solo\u2019d end game content on Arelith that some groups fail to fight to let alone kill.<br/>\n<br/>\nBecause of the way the server is built, saves are off the charts making DC based casters more challenging. \u00a0PCs can hit and do hit saves in the 50s on a 30 level cap server. \u00a0They are still viable of course and there are Evocation Clerics and Necromancy Clerics. \u00a0The epic spells require evocation to cast without damaging yourself and they are often used as PC combat \u201cEnders\u201d meaning get them down to half hp and Hellball -&gt; Ruin them. \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSummons control has also been improved meaning a healer always has their summons walking ahead of them buffed to suck aggro. \u00a0My 30 healer \u201cnever\u201d attacks and uses tumble to run around and shed aggro onto my tank/summons when attacked. \u00a0He wields a self enchanted sling with no ammo to avoid attacks of opportunity.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeat Changes: \u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Feat_changes\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://wiki.arelith.com/Feat_changes</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSummon Changes: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Summoning_Changes\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://wiki.arelith.com/Summoning_Changes</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSummon List: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Summons\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://wiki.arelith.com/Summons</a><br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Cooking is not quite finished as a crafting skill and is very labour intensive, as a result there are not too many people that take it.  Alchemy is a solid craft with some decent coin to be made and much of what it produces is used in other crafts.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor Arelith, I typically make my melee characters alchemists with the thought that it focuses on a needed melee consumable (essences and skeens), but there are other sellable consumables as well.  Everything else is a one off cost.  Meaning I buy my weapon and I never have to buy it again, etc.  But I always need essences.  The exception is when I am planning on a 5% build or a racial crafting build.  My Orog is a forger for example.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy healer is a tailor and a tier 3 Dweomercraft so everything he wears and wields outside of his staff is made by tailoring and/or enchanting.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this boils down to the idea that there is no best choice and I think alchemy is just fine for your healer and either forging or alchemy for your melee build would be fine as well.

A good example being Grizzled_Dwarflord's The War Machine of Gruumsh build, GDL uses quicken spell to open up more spell levels so he can cast the Divine Power spell more often.\u00a0<br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>The Divine Power of Gruumsh:</strong>\u00a0observe the number of Divine Power Switches available:<br/>\n3rd: 7 Normal<br/>\n4th: 7 Extended<br/>\n5th: 7 Extended<br/>\n7th: 5 Quickened<br/>\n8th: 5 Quickened</div></blockquote>\n- to cast two spells in a round, if you are not hasted<br/>\n<br/>\nIn an environment where haste is easily available (and this includes equipped items with the 'Haste' magical property on them, or potions of speed which supply a haste spell to the drinker), Quicken Spell tends to be not particularly useful as this is a much easier way to cast two spells in a round.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking at the Arelith Wiki I do not see many significant changes beyond it being able to be obtained 'at spell circle 3 (I assume this means level 3 spells)' but I hope an Arelith player can discuss this further from an Arelith perspective.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

This build doesn't get a reliable source of Haste, and in PvP any Haste potions or wands will be easily dispelled due to the low caster level of 10 (assuming vanilla potions/wands). Also vanilla Haste potions (not sure about Arelith) only last for 10 rounds which is an extremely short duration for a server like Arelith, since it has both rest restrictions and a game clock where 1 game hour is 6 real time minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're not planning on partying with a Haste caster every single time you play then Auto Quicken is a very useful feat, for both PvM and PvP.<br/>\nHaving said that, I might be overestimating the importance of AQ3 since I don't play on Arelith.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Essentially letting you drop the most powerful Cleric Domain.  However, by all means you can swap them out for other feats if needed and rely on divine haste wands.  The cost is more in the time needed to leverage haste and its refresh which in turn can result in your death (rarely in PvM and more commonly in PvP).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are planning on engaging in PvP I wouldn\u2019t drop it.  If you are not, it is fair game as far as I am concerned.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy healer has it and he actively avoids PvP., with no \u201cquick buffer tools\u201d it sure is convenient :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the builds, they are built to manage PvP with the idea that PvM is a subset of what is needed for PvP and any build that can handle PvP will be solid in PvM.  This is accurate on Arelith, less accurate on other servers.

I personally would always take it on any 30th level caster build especially on a cleric as they get exceptional buffing options (There are not many viable 30CL builds).  Some people will say gate is a better option, those people do not realize that you need to hit the end game mobs to kill them and your EDK has the best AB of any summon on a 30CL with the applicable Epic Spell Focus.<br/>\n<br/>\nDweomercraft is one of the top tier skill sets to make viable end game equipment builds.   That said, there are a bunch of those folks about.  I prefer to be able to do my own predominately because 5%ing things is labour (clicking) intensive and I feel bad about asking someone else to do it for me even if I pay them.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally (and I have a rebuilt on my 30 healer), I have not quite sorted out if I am going EDK, Scribe Scroll and ESF:Lore and dropping AutoQuicken III (most of the important stuff is not in the 7-9 range) or not.  <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, do not feel there is a solid choice advantage here :).

Generally people will carry a set of enchanted equipment to meet a need. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn this case, the build I provided Sucy would optimally have a full set of enchanted equipment (11 items) with +2 Lore/Disable Traps/Open Locks/Search on it.  There are a couple of tailored items that would would swap in for the end game netting 50 open locks/disable traps which lets you open all the runic chests and most everything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the Charisma, it nets a DC 53 vs Will, 43 round sanctuary effect that does not dismiss summons when cast and is not dismissed when a summon is cast under the effect (from memory) on the protection feat sanctuary.

A Protection Feat healer, and very specifically this healer support build is meant to spend as much time as possible in a state of relative damage immunity.  Either by not attracting aggro or by actively avoiding being targeted using extended GSanc and the Protection feat. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest weakness of most cleric builds is the large spin up time and the impact of being dispelled.  It is possible to dispel the various Sanctuaries but it takes an area of effect (sanctuary prevents direct targeting) dispel and also being able to see the target (Truesight has an 1 round duration).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, it is a flexible opportunity as is the auto quickness line depending on what you are looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would generally avoid taking GSF: Abjuration for the IGMS protection as the healer has other tools to both avoid this and mitigate it, as well as other things to be doing then quaffing a shield potion.  However ESF: Abjuration for the Dispel bonus AND the custom Ward feat is definitely interesting.  Also interesting is Epic Spell Mummy Dust, Empower Spell, Toughness, Craft Wand ESF:Lore (for level 9 wizard spells via scroll).<br/>\n<br/>\nI have definitely considered dropping SF: Abjuration and Arcane Defence: Abjuration for ESF:Lore and Mummy Dust.  I suspect I would if I was not human or I was in the Underdark.  The single biggest Cleric weakness is lack of a Breach spell and being able to cast Mordekainen\u2019s Disjunction requires an 80 lore which a healer build can meet with ESF:Lore and bunch of targeted enchanted/crafted gear, Timestop scrolls are also a very solid bonus.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor your EDK you can bump its AB a bunch using cleric spells, and heal/overheal including adding regen.  It chews through end game content and will surprise PCs in PvP who can just avoid most EDK summons by relying on AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also very much worth remembering that you can spontaneously cast Heal and Healing Circle.  Build your spell slots out to ensure you account for this.<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
