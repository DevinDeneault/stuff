      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hi. I was never a fan of bards as a main character until NWN, and now I keep coming back to them. I've started many games, and most of my later builds are bards. My problem is I always want to try something else.\u00a0 So I thought I'd ask here and get some ideas.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) PvM.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Level cap - OC and Hordes, which I believe is about level 27.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Race preference - Half-orc, or possibly half-orc. Or then again half-orc. But never, ever, ever, a dwarf. Mmmmh, that sounds like a good line for a song.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Class preference - Combat orientated Barbarian / Bard. The question is the 3rd class. RDD 10 sounds great, but I always get bored around level 7. And it impacts my bard levels. So I'm thinking 4 RDD for strength - OR - COT for extra feats - OR - no third class. In all cases I was thinking upping my Charisma 2 as I level up, the rest in strength.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Melee preference - High-damage strength-based, possibly with battle axe when a shield would help. Specialized attacks I don't usually use, so any suggestions are welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Range preference - Must be DEX archery as my WIS is my dump stat. Even if I choose heavy armour as a feat, I would still prefer a DEX of 14, as I prefer to be flexible with use of a bow when required.<br/>\n<br/>\n7) Weapon preference - I prefer great axe as it gets the job done quicker. I tried battle axe and shield, which worked but was slow. Or maybe great axe as main weapon with battle axe and shield when required (which I presume would be better with COT).<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also considering halberd if the halberd problem is solved in 1.69. My other worry about the halberd is that the only one I think is practical is the forged one with sonic damage. But does sonic work on deafened enemies?<br/>\n<br/>\n8) Maximum item enhancement - No idea, I have never got that far.<br/>\n<br/>\n9) Spellcasting - Buffing, possibly to cast strong offensive spells if possible. Casting spells reliably while wearing armor would be nice but not important.<br/>\n<br/>\n10) Custom factors - None.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther factors, I don't like to min max as I prefer to be flexible. I also don't like the idiot talk with an INT lower than 10, that's why I don't use INT as a dump stat. But dropping DEX for STR is an idea if use of archery makes my character too weak.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I always feel like UMD is cheating, so I never use it. I know, I know. But who said Half Orcs were smart?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi ShagratGromGol!<br/>\nYou have a lot of thoughts about what kind of character you want to build.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me try to sum this up: A PvM Bard/Barbarian strength based Greataxe-wielding half-orc with heavy armor and a little extra in cha and dex. Possibly some CoT or RDD. Selfbuffing in heavy armor. No cheating, no UMD, no min/maxing, no stupid talking.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough this can be done, much of it is counterproductive with few, if any synergies. <br/>\n<br/>\nI can build a strong lvl 30 Bard with a few extras, but that will not be a half-orc.<br/>\nI can build an armored self buffer, but that will be a Cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you want, I can build a strong lvl 30 (or 28) Barbarian half-orc with terrifying rage, RDD 10 with Bard as minor class to get RDD and for skill dumps. But don't expect priority on high dexterity, high charisma and high intelligence.<br/>\n<br/>\nMick<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Or are we being half orc, half egg-laying clucking thing? (Sorry, running with a dwarf atm, and the roleplay is getting worrying...)<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously, if you don't try Aielund you're being a fool to yourself - it's soooooooo much better than the official stuff. It took me over a year of playing before I downloaded it, despite encouragement to do so from the great and good, and have kicked myself for taking so long ever since. Oh, and there are many kewler half-orc avatars available there, too - and Bard gets an extra 2 skill points per level as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nGo on, you know you want to...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">What I suspect is that Aielund and most other custom modules will assume he has SoU and use stuff from SoU and not work without SoU. There might still be some really old stuff that requires only the OC. The days before SoU were before my time. I got NWN in the platinum edition, which has both expansion packs plus some premium modules, but fewer of them than diamond edition.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
