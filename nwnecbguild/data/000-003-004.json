I used the Monk/Sorc/RDD with some success once, but not sure I would go strength monk without RDD.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt least with HiPS and ED plus his 20 monk levels, his survivability will be great.

That raises other issues in itself, of course - essentially building for only one type of foe (mage-killer, priest-wrangler, whatever), and hence being vulnerable to many others. A dexer Monk is probably better suited than most to this, but still won't be at its pinnacle.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I know how crappy it sounds, but a Kama build (possibly dual-wield) would still do it better, I reckon.<br/>\n<br/>\nEssentially, all I'm saying is that Shaklone needs to give us a bit more info as to what they want...</div>",
