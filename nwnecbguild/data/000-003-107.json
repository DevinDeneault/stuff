      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hey all! Very much like the setup of this place here. I particularly admire the art that some people place into build presentation; makes for a pleasent read.\u00a0<img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\n So after skimming over the forums, I noticed a few things:<br/>\n<br/>\n 1. Holy cow there are a lot of fighters and monks.<br/>\n<br/>\n 2. Most strength builds don't seem to be striving for devastating critical, so I'm guessing a lot of the contributers here play in places where it is banned.<br/>\n<br/>\n 3. I've seen the term 'melee mage' prop up quite a lot, but I can't actually see a build that specifically focuses on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n 4. So there's a monk speed hack that I was totally unaware of involving expeditious retreat and mass haste, it sounds silly.<br/>\n<br/>\n So with all that in mind, I decided what this place needs is a...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Level 40 Tensers Transformation build.

available on the mouse cursor prior to shift.<br/>\n<br/>\n They would both benefit from the silly monk speed hack, have ESF discipline [aint no kid immune gear whilst shape changed!] and Epic Warding.<br/>\n<br/>\n Off the top of my head, they'd both be getting 10 + 2 [as] + 5 [empowered wisdom] + 9 [empowereed dex] +8 [Tumble] + 15 [nat/ac/def] + 20 [dodge from haste + mage armour + epic

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Actually, sorcs are probably the worst choice for a high-mage Tenser exploit due to their lack of known spells even with the pally synergy going on.\u00a0 It's easy for a wizard that recognizes dismal spell resistance situations (like SR monks, lotsa raks, constructs, demilichs... yada yada yada) to retool slots for maximum self-buffing and replace all the missile storms, wilting, bigby's and instakill necromancer spells to make a badass Tenser.\u00a0 A sorc is stuck between a rock and a hard place.\u00a0 Can't optimize offensive casting, dispelling and self-buffing all at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\n So it's not that nobody's considered it.\u00a0 It's just that the concept only dominates under very specific conditions i.e. a one-trick pony.\u00a0 Tenser's +3 sword will have trouble piercing serious DR. And the lack of gear merge of arcane polymorphs, in general, sux.\u00a0 So while your Tenser waltzes onto the battleground, all those Greater Swordsman belts and Fire Resist rings on other players or NPCs will come back to haunt them.\u00a0 The higher magic environments, with +10 and higher weapon enhancements will make Tenser's attack look foolish in comparison.\u00a0 One Mord from a mid-high mage and the gig is up. I, myself, built a Dexer high-stealth hipser, epic dodger wiz26/rog13/sd1 focusing on the Tenser weapon that was uber until the enhancement levels began to neutralize the Tenser bonuses.\u00a0 Tenser is more of an arcane get-out-of-jail-free card for spell resistance traps than a universal panacea.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Monk class is essentially an exploit class with minimum level investment and no prereqs like with the prestige.\u00a0 Free feats galore with just a 6-level commitment, the best attack progression in the game, best pre-epic saves, skill set only taking a backseat to rogues, bards and assassins... what's not to like?\u00a0 The only downside is the alignment.\u00a0 No bardic monks! <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\n Fighter is the universal feat generator class with CoT a close 2nd there.\u00a0 It makes it easy to achieve combat goals by virtue of all the proficiencies that would otherwise cost valuable feats to acquire.\u00a0 Their armor proficiency is not limited like with barbs and rangers and they are not constricted by alignment. There is a lot to gain using that class in many, many builds.<br/>\n<br/>\n Yes, DevCrit is nerfed on many of today's most popular servers. The popularity trend has become biased towards roleplay and away from H&amp;S action.\u00a0 Besides, DevCrit is also a one-trick-pony easily countered by PM10 or Shifter Risen Lord which is EXACTLY what you'll find when they leave it at default.\u00a0 Damage adepts are generally the more reliable choice because their power is less effected by the sorts of creature encounters or gear props (like belts with<em> Immunity: Critical Hits</em>).<br/>\n<br/>\n Yah.\u00a0 The speed exploit is indeed crazy to witness.\u00a0 We used to race DMs across the server with our toons using that spell/feat combination just for giggles on a slow night with many party no-shows.<br/>\n<br/>\n Since you've expressed interest in a legacy build, I'll repost it like I just did with one of Mith's oldy moldies and try to grab as much of the discussion as possible.\u00a0 I must be careful which ones to port over because building has changed a lot over the years and not all of those builds comply with v1.69.\u00a0 (Don't want to confuse new players and aspiring toon builders.)\u00a0 But I think Web's build is a great tutorial about how to get the most out of the wizard class so it should still be relevant today.\u00a0 Be patient, though.\u00a0 I am in and out on ECB for short periods at a time but I'll get to it.\u00a0 Promise.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>edit: <strong><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2354625\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">link to Melee Mage</a></strong></em><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Or something else?). I'm not that hot on build analysis, as others will attest. Indeed, I'm just coming up to my second anniversary of playing NwN, but I stumbled upon this site early on and have been annoying everyone with my \"but<em> why</em>, Dad?\" questions ever since. I'm afraid I'm not a magic fan, and am still trying to come to terms with the divine malarkey, let alone the arcane. I tend rather to the \"Hulk bash, Hulk smash,\" heavy infantry school, but I'm learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n Rather than just blathering on, however, I'll try addressing at least some of your introductory remarks.<br/>\n<br/>\n 1. Yes there are, but to be fair, I expect the Fighter element is mostly as a secondary or tertiary class - not wishing to demean the class at all, of course, but if you're going for melee and you're a tad feat starved, your first port of call would be... As to Monk, well, of course, because it's the singular best class in the universe. There may be one or two who'll try to gainsay that, but they're simply wrong. <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" /> (let the games commence!)<br/>\n<br/>\n 2. It's an odd one this. When I joined here, the majority of STR builds were DevCritters, and I remember clearly the boyish delight of landing my first DevCrit. However, you're right that many places have indeed banned DevCrit now, but more - if we're constructing builds (and I'm using \"we\" to mostly mean \"other people\") that can be used universally (granted, with tweaks for environment and personal preference), It's often better to design one that can be used everywhere, then adapted to DevCrit if required, than design one that can only be used in a DevCrit environment, then deconstructed to use it everywhere else. Hope that makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n 3. Don't know, don't care. (Sorry, flippant. Had a scotch or two.)<br/>\n<br/>\n 4. Don't know, do care. Where did you come across that?<br/>\n<br/>\n There, verbal diarrhoea finished for now.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT:</strong></em> Bloody hell, I'm being ninja'd everywhere of late - Hip got me this time!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Yes I was aiming for a one trick pony option, with a +5 sword and plenty of fort save for dev critters.<br/>\n<br/>\n I imagine in high magic item or dispelling environments such a concept would fall flat on its face. I am also familiar with the PM and Risen lord hordes that inevitably populate dev crit environments.<br/>\n<br/>\n I personally have not played in many high magic item environments (+10 weapons and above) as I feel it restricts the number of classes that are effective. I suppose in such environments that monks and fighters (particularly Dex ones) would be more effective than I'm used to.<br/>\n<br/>\n And looking through some older builds: I'm seeing more of the recognisable power build combos that I expected to see here ( like what maxillian Kane tends to make). Was wondering where they went!<br/>\n<br/>\n What servers to people mainly populate these days?
