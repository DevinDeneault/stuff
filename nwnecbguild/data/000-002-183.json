Otherwise it feels wrong. barb gets mighty rage as well, so it is a double stat requirement for that class.<br/>\nAlso useable on medium magic servers that offer some physical immunities and/or regen.<br/>\n<br/>\nmy 50 cents</div>"

It does everything better than most, but is not a stand out offensive or defensive character like a WM, a warrior cleric, a full fledged DWD.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat it compares mostly too, is actually a non-dwarf dwarven defender with a bit more umph!</div>"

The stocky ones just deal with their anger in a different way. Rather than running around like a headless chicken trying to scare people, our dwarven friends channel their fury in a more zen way (and much more energy-efficient, too). Followers of Clangeddin and Morodin don't want enemies to run away from them, they want to pull them inwards then methodically beat seven shades out of them. Alright, maybe not that zen after all.<br/>\n<span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83c\udf85</span> (only bloody beardy emoji I could find in the pile, sorry) <span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83d\ude4f</span></div>",
