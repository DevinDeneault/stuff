Of course with UMD so you can have that flaming rapier in the picture asap :)<br/>\n<br/>\nDesign wise I put the Str to 14 for carrying capacity and a little more damage without sneak particularly with the crits which one should get heaps of em.<br/>\n<br/>\nSneaks you can also get in with stealth, UMD with summons, improved knockdown or traps.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried a Ranger 1 Cheese version for free dual wield but Fighter brought so much to the table in terms of playability.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI also mucked around with monk for a while, deflect arrows/epic dodge/free improved knockdown and monk speed would have been awesome. A Rogue 18/WM 16/Monk 6 build ended up with 44 Base AB but Weapon Finesse ends up being taken at level 15 which is a bit late, and the even numbered rogue level I didn't particularly like, plus losing WS/EWS in a dex crit build didn't seem worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI...Samphus wrote a Court Duellist Rogue 17/Fighter 4/WM19 which was strength based, it looked nice.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI liked the character concept too with the naval privateer stuff. It's quite flexible alignment wise. He or she could be an neutral evil pirate raiding the seas, a chaotic neutral adventurer explorer visiting new lands, or lawful good noble ship's admiral defending the nation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, sharing this for your consumption, it seems somewhat novel. Maybe there are some tweaks, happy to hear em as usual!<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Rogue(17), Weapon Master(19), Fighter(4), Human\nSTR: 14\nCON: 13 (14)\nINT: 14\n\n01: Rogue(1): Dodge, Expertise\n03: Rogue(2): Weapon Focus: Rapier, {Evasion}\n05: Rogue(4)\n07: Rogue(6)\n09: Fighter(2): Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack\n11: Weapon Master(2)\n13: Weapon Master(4)\n15: Weapon Master(6): Blind Fight\n17: Rogue(8)\n19: Weapon Master(9)\n21: Weapon Master(11): Improved Knockdown\n23: Rogue(9)\n25: Rogue(10): Improved Evasion\n27: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Rapier, Epic Weapon Specialization: Rapier\n29: Weapon Master(14)\n31: Weapon Master(16): Armor Skin\n33: Rogue(13): Epic Dodge, Defensive Roll\n35: Rogue(14)\n37: Rogue(15)\n39: Rogue(17): Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=29)\n\nSkillpoints: 335\nSaving Throw bonuses: Traps: +4\nAB (max, naked): 46 (melee), 39 (ranged)\nSpell Casting:\u00a0\n\n\n01: Disable Trap(4), Hide(4), Intimidate(4), Listen(4), Move Silently(4), Open Lock(1), Search(4), Set Trap(4), Spot(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(3),\u00a0\n03: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Listen(1), Move Silently(2), Set Trap(1), Spot(2), Tumble(2), UMD(2),\u00a0\n05: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(7),\u00a0\n07: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(17),\u00a0\n09: Discipline(7), Save(20),\u00a0\n11: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(25),\u00a0\n13: Discipline(2), Spot(1), Save(31),\u00a0\n15: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(37),\u00a0\n17: Disable Trap(9), Hide(9), Move Silently(9), Spot(1), Tumble(9), UMD(9), Save(5),\u00a0\n19: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(10),\u00a0\n21: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(16),\u00a0\n23: Disable Trap(6), Hide(6), Move Silently(6), Spot(1), Tumble(5), UMD(6),\u00a0\n25: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Spot(1), UMD(2), Save(4),\u00a0\n27: Discipline(1), Save(11),\u00a0\n29: Discipline(2), Spot(1), Save(4),\u00a0\n31: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(10),\u00a0\n33: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Search(6), Spot(1),\u00a0\n35: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Listen(4), Move Silently(2), Spot(1),\u00a0\n37: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Spot(1), Tumble(5),\u00a0\n39: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Listen(3), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Save(4),\u00a0</details></div>"

      "content": "<div>When I make DEX Rog/WM's I either go for Rog13/Figh8/WM19 or Rog19/Figh14/WM7.<br/>\n<br/>\nSwitching to Rog19/Figh14/WM7 loses 3 AB from WM levels, but you get +1 from BAB and another +1 from 2 more G DEX feats so you only lose 1 AB overall. You get plenty of feats in exchange for that 1 AB, so I would still recommend switching your level layout.<br/>\nIf you go elf or halfling you can increase AB further but that would mean either an XP penalty, which I know you dislike, or using a kukri, which wouldn't fit with your theme.</div>"

An extra feat is usually more useful than +1d6 sneak attack and 12 skill points.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour feat choices and skills look good, the only things I would change are the level layout and weapon choice. I assume that you are planning on using Find Traps wands on WoG, since you have high Disable Trap but low Search?</div>"
