      "content": "<div>Hi All,<br/>\n<br/>\n This will teach me to get someone else interested in NwN. My friend (previously mentioned elsewhere) has asked if I could try concocting him a Monk/ CoT/ DwD, preferably STR based. It's a build I don't recall seeing before, and there doesn't appear to be one in Hip's Fantastic Contrapulator. This should probably tell me something, but there does seem to be a certain synergy between them (eg, balanced saves - one Fort and Will, one Fort and Reflex, one all three), so I thought I'd give it a go. And that's where the trouble started...<br/>\n<br/>\n I appreciate I'd need at least 10 levels of Monk before I could take either other class, which would impact on BAB (giving a max of 27 at L40, I believe), but mean I'd easily be able to accommodate all other pre-requisites (Dodge, Toughness and WF in a melee weapon) by then, as well as WF in Unarmed Fighting (should I want it) in single figures. However, if I'm to take full advantage of Monk skills (mostly Tumble), I'll need at least another 2 levels for dumps, although I'd probably prefer 3 or 4 to narrow the gaps (sorry, should have mentioned, this is for SP - though not solo-ing, PvM, so most, if not all, of the time will be spent pre-L40) and have at least a few more skill points to play with. Now, that seems to me like a lot of levels to take without making Monk the dominant class, so I wondered about a Monk 20/ CoT 10/ DwD 10 construction, trotting around in robes. But then I started trying to square that with CoT and DwD benefits when taken in higher levels and in \"full plate and packing a Dwarven Waraxe\", and my brain put up a \"Gone to Lunch\" sign and sodded off.<br/>\n<br/>\n So I suppose my questions are twofold: 1) Is the concept worth pursuing in the first place? 2) Assuming \"yes\" to 1, do you have any advice as to a decent split, please?<br/>\n<br/>\n I should probably be better than this by now, I know, but it would be foolish not to ask those who know these things better than I.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks in advance <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/11.gif\"/></div>",

Have done so now, of which more later.<br/>\n<br/>\n I suspect my \"playmate\" (he'll love that), was looking for what he might think would be the best saves available in a melee build, to help with tanking. That, and as a 6'5\" man, he has an alarming fondess for Dwarves (seeing how the other half lives, maybe?). For me, I thought it was an interesting idea that could potentially improve on my Grim Stonefoot build of a year ago (who was a Fighter 10/ DwD 23/ WM 7, over whom Max and I had some interesting discussions). I'm now less convinced.<br/>\n<br/>\n Having looked at both the Guardian and the Fist of Moradin, several things arise in the grey fog. First, and applicable to both, is the startling lack of skill points. I knew a build like this would be SP starved, but I'd certainly be looking to up INT to 14 (dropping WIS by 4 in the Guardian, and CON by 2 in Fist of Moradin - probably also losing 1 from DEX in that build to put...somewhere), which would allow me to max the cross-classed Spellcraft and take worthwhile points in Concentration and Listen or Spot.<br/>\n<br/>\n Both builds also take Power Attack and Great Cleave, although only one is a Dev Crit build. I'd drop Great Cleave like a hot turnip, and PA is a luxury rather than a necessity. In the Fist of Moradin build, I see Circle Kick has been taken, and that's not a feat I see very often, if at all, these days. So that could possibly be replaced by a second Imp Crit in a melee weapon. I know I neglected to mention that I wouldn't be looking to make a Dev Crit build, but I'm not, so that opens the potential build up for another couple of GSTRs.<br/>\n<br/>\n The assorted comments of Grizzled Dwarflord, Grimnir, Avado and Thaxll'ssyllia all make for interesting reading. I think the concensus seems to be that there's either too much DwD or too little (always helpful!), and that there may well be a case to take Fighter over CoT.\u00a0 Thinking about it, without the CHA, CoT is really there only for its boosts to saves, and with feats going spare pre-epic, there's little to prevent Iron Will, etc, making an appearance to mitigate those losses if Fighter is indeed taken.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, all in all, the class mix is never going to be optimal, whatever split is decided upon. For RP purposes, it's not an unattractive possibility, but the same or better benefits can be gleaned elsewhere. My own preference at the moment for something on these lines would be a Monk 25/ Fighter 10/ DwD 5. I don't know if it's one I can sell (I do know he likes the DR from DwD), and if not, I might look at a Monk 12/ Fighter 6/ DwD 22. Which is wildly different, I know.<br/>\n<br/>\n Any thoughts? (And thanks for your patience)</div></div>",

      "content": "<div>Now that looks interesting, Hip - except I'd have to drop Imp Expertise for another melee WF if I'm to take CoT and go unarmed (it's obviously fine if I take Kama, but I do tend to see that as one more for DEXers - scratch 'em to ribbons rather than knock their blocks off).

For CoT, you need a WF in a melee weapon, and Unarmed Strike doesn't count as a weapon (vagiaries of the rules). Thus, if I were to go unarmed (with WF), I'd need another WF to qualify for CoT (and as you suggest, Dwarven Waraxe would be where I'd look - I've played lots of Dwarves, but as yet none with their prefered weapon, oddly), hence my swapping out of Imp Expertise - nothing to do with its intrinsic merits.<br/>\n<br/>\n As to the skills, yes, Concentration would be where I'd put the extra points, and bless you for delivering it, but it wasn't a deal-breaker - as I said, you can't have everything. Still, I feel this could be fun to play for those of us who rely on others for non-pot buffs. If he doesn't like it, I might well keep it anyway. I like oddballs!</div></div>",

      "content": "<div>That kind of build won't be good for your friend stag.<br/>\n<br/>\n I could enter a (very) lengthy explanation of why is that, but i will save you from the ramble and instead just say that the build will achieve it's maximum potential very late in its game-life. And of course you always need at least 16 levels of Monk before you even consider doing an unarmed version of (dwarven) Bruce Lee. That leaves you with a possible [Monk 16/ CoT 10/ DwD 14 splt], but you also need to time your Monk lvls carefully so that you take your last one at 37th or later in order to gain maximum tumble AC. The obvious downside is that you won't achieve max Fist damage before that lvl as well... Better is [Monk 20/ CoT 10/ DwD 10] but this also means you lose on bonus Epic feats from DwD and DR 3/- , see where this is going?<br/>\n<br/>\n The best feauture of DwD is (Defensive Awareness), that comes at 5th lvl and essentially makes you immune to Dexterity AC loss when flat-footed or attacked by an invisible opponent. When buffed that could be as much as (8 AC) that you retain on your character at all times. What's even better is that it will even <strong>prevent sneak attacks</strong> from working on you as long as you keep attacking something! No other class in the game has something that good. After that, the Stance and Dmg mitigation are both welcome additions of course. Dwarven Defender is awesome stuff, you just need to balance out how many lvls you want to put in your build. You also need to decide if you are going to be in robes or clad in full plate man, that changes all the build, but basically, fast like the wind and fun mean robes and robust but slow means plate armour.<br/>\n<br/>\n My suggestion is that if you are going to put that many (16+) lvls of Monk in your build, then you better make use of all his class feautures, meaning going either Unarmed or with your favored Farm implements, wearing only your best Pyjamas and avoid using a Barrel head strapped on your forearm. Possible builds are from the top of my head [Monk 20/ FTR 6/ DwD 14], [Monk 20/ CoT 14/ DwD 6], [Monk 20/ CoT 10/ DwD 10] or something along these lines. Those will give you ample room to reach max Fist Damage early on the build and still have Monk lvls left for maxing out Tumble. You will also gain more SR, more AC and both the mind-effects immunity and etherealness for going from 16 lvls to 20 near the end, making for a nice capstone in your build.<br/>\n<br/>\n Doh! I still got \"lengthy\" with my post.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Hip, i heard a tale from a bard about an Axe, \"cough\" <em>dwarven mines</em> \"cough\", \"cough\" <em>near desert</em> \"cough\", \"cough\" <em>Oathkeeper </em>\"cough\".</div>"

Except that Awareness #2 at DwD 5 gives immunity to flanking which is the real DwD gem IMO.\u00a0 The one you cited is basically uncanny dodge which is owned by rogues, assassins and SDs as well as DwD 2.<br/>\n<br/>\n BTW, something positive did occur by virtue of this discussion of bad combos (at least positive for me).\u00a0 I've decided to try to optimize a DwD dragon myself.\u00a0 Most of the legacy attempts were done when only 14 Levels of druid were needed for DS (like a couple our fearless leader posted during that era) and the balance of the others just don't seem very optimized. Besides, I know how thrilled Valerfor must be at the prospect of stumbling through corridors getting stuck with a big dragon butt waving in the breeze.\u00a0 But it seems to be pretty bullet-proof and nasty so may venture where few have tried and stick to elemental prowess in tight spaces.\u00a0 If you see it pop-up as official, it's been tested on HG when I get back home to my ancient minitower.</div>"

I'll give him the options of Empyre's Order of the Stone Fist 2 (above) and Valerfor's The Unbreakable (also above), so he can make an assessment. (I think I might keep Hip's build for myself, to play with later). I'll try and complement this with pocketbeetle's <strong>Rare Breed</strong> (Bard 2/ Cleric 15/ AA 23 - elf), which should be a challenge in itself: never played AA and am currently barely passable as a Cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\n I really appreciate the coming together of 3 heavyweights <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/13.gif\"/></div>",
