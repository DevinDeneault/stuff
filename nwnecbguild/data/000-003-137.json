      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hey there guys, I just came back from a long hiatus and decided to do something ....new? I wanted to make an Elven druid. <img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/ce/e6/d3/cee6d3468240ac89dc66a4e03303f189.jpg\" /><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Now Arelith has a lv 30 cap. But, I was thinking about creating a elven druid, a druid whom focuses mostly in casting, but if need be can transform and take a few hits. Now, I know a good synergy might be druid/cleric, druid/monk. But, I want to keep it with as many druid levels as viable. Preferably till the 26th level so as to get infinite elemental shapes (unless this would not help what I'm going for). Monk might be good due to the AC bonus it gets from wisdom, but so late in I can't help but wonder if just a pure druid would be better. (Since one could wear armor without risk of spell failure) Weapon of Choice if any would be a longsword or Rapier.<br/>\n<br/>\n I figured these stats would be a good starting place (feel free to correct me) Mostly PvM, but PvP can be a slice of life (not the focus though)<br/>\n Race: Elf, Alignment: Lawful Neutral.<br/>\n STR: 10<br/>\n Dex: 12<br/>\n Con: 12\u00a0<br/>\n Wis: 16\u00a0<br/>\n INT: 14\u00a0<br/>\n CHA: 12 (For animal empathy, etc)<br/>\n<br/>\n Now some of the skills I want to focus on just a bit would be Animal Empathy, Heal, Concentration, tiny Lore (identifying items isn't that important, so possibly no points), but maybe spellcraft (till 15 points maybe?). (If monk levels taken) Discipline, Hide and move silently.<br/>\n<br/>\n However, you guys are the experts, so I realize none of this may be any bit realistic. But, yeah that's why I came here to get guidance. I wanted it to mainly be a caster though. So... yeah xD Anything I missed please feel free to tell me, and I'll do my best to answer<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Leave you with this:<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://67.media.tumblr.com/2cd2bb08b0f2dcb751e46d2a7bbfdb90/tumblr_nn3k5vD6CP1rv231do1_1280.jpg\" /><br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'm happy to be back. Well Dragon Shape is indeed possible without COT (There's a totem druid in combination +2 Wis with some clever usage can indeed net you with the Dragon Shape at lv 30 (with gift +2 Wis). But, Dragon Shape was never my intention. You know how many druids I see rolling dragon? ...All of them. Literally. All of them. Why? Probably because it was a decent build to begin with, but.. yeah I wanna be different from all those...Dragon sayers. (Even though, it's definitely useful if you know what you're doing)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Looking at it, I don't really feel like being a walking hospital (Cleric/Druid), although I know that isn't actually the intent with the cleric.<br/>\n<br/>\n Like my original post my intent isn't to make a full melee Druid (Caster foremost, Melee if possible second.). I imagine Listen could be replaced with Concentration. Yes? I only ask this because of the spell True Seeing. As it would give away Greater Sanctuary, Invisible, and Hidden targets much more reliably than just seeing the via 'red' little splashes of noise on the screen. Something regular listen wouldn't be able to do. If I'm not mistaken even to dispell it, it would require them to come out of hiding in the first place no? (Well outside of the bonus 'whisper' range it grants, but that's not really important.)<br/>\n<br/>\n I might be under the impression that casting or using items removes one from 'Stealth Mode', Invisibility, or Sanctuary. I like where you're going about this, but I also want it to be able to use spells as I originally intended it too. (Which, I don't know if anything but Concentration would really affect it that much). Well except maybe a Spell focus, but I only see Evocation and/or Conjuration worth taking long term.<br/>\n<br/>\n I know listen is technically 'undispellable', but I imagine the skill points allocated to 'listen' would be better served elsewhere. (Even though, one can make succesful listen checks even when blind/deaf) ...Though, if you're deaf the game contradicts itself, but yeah. But, I'd like to hear your thoughts on this so far as to get the most of what I want, and what would still borderline 'possible'.<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That's indeed my fault. I gave one thing whilst striving for another. I shall be more specific, you're only doing your best to help, but you cannot do that if I'm unclear, it leads to more questions than solutions or answers.<br/>\n<br/>\n Despite this, you are on the right track. I want to be able to cast (with potentially not every spell being resisted everytime)\u00a0 But, if need be I wanted a druid that could as you put it 'SHIFT! ....for the love of Sylvanus, SHIFT!' for melee. But, for my future knowledge, does Concentration have any affect on if somebody decided to shoot an arrow at you? Does that help prevent interruption, or would that fall under your concealed advice for no concentration as well? I'm merely asking for those 'types' that don't need to get in your face shoulder to shoulder. (Archer NPC's, Players, etc) I'm merely taking in all considerations, so I ask for your patience. Best to ask these questions now.<br/>\n<br/>\n Okay, see that's the explanation I was looking for Listen can spot enemies not within LOS. So, one could potentially see them around a corner or through a doorway. I didn't know this little tidbit of information, and if necessary I could always just cast true seeing and still have listen... the best of both worlds. I just assumed it helped see enemies within LOS in stealth mode. As during my times messing with it, I never was shown that indication, but maybe I wasn't just looking close enough. ....That or my driving camera mode prevented this type of usage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Yes, I know , but please do not think merely because I state the dragon is possible, that I intend for you to know such information. If anything, it's information you have now that you didn't before, and you can choose whether or not to consider it for other people. And you are right, You cannot reasonably ask other's of Arelith for advice on building. Not because of them not wanting to show their hand. (Some of them will genuinely help). But, others will give misinformation, just so that the build they have will stand above yours. I.E Concentration is not needed for a Caster. You should take Discipline instead.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Yes, I think you can set, and disable traps and pick locks whilst stealthed normally. But, just about anything else might kick you out of it. But, yeah.. .that was my idea of a playstyle, Caster until forced to 'go green' in melee.\u00a0 ....Never understood how come Druids never got Polymorph Self though. (You know, the spell) Well minus the Zombie. Maybe because they already have lots of shapes, but that might just be me. Anyway, I will let you respond, and I suppose we shall see where our conversation goes. Looking forward to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

How would you play out the build? Obviously monk in the 21-23 would go as you suggested, but what sorta of feats\u00a0 would you recommend throughout.

(The other camera angles give better positions I admit) But, in driving mode it feels more... how do I put it? Like you're going through the dungeon instead of overlooking it. That and turning around and having your character unable to see in front of him because the camera doesn't move with the direction is kinda wonky. (Quickly adjusted, but wonky. Course, I don't like to be too terribly zoomed out, so there's that.) Though, if you're feeling up to it. You should try Driving mode with the camera just about on your characters back (little zoomed back) gives a interesting outlook on things. I am also going to try and get use to the other camera views. (As sometimes...driving mode is a terrible thing to have in some places)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n I appreciate the help with the build. I think Scribe scroll will be. more useful here Mostly because, as I remember correctly you can get blank scrolls in great access (and they are cheap). Then, again I logged into a whole different world from what I left not too long ago. Even the starter city did a upside down turn.<br/>\n<br/>\n Again thanks for the help, Hipredux, and remember... to fight a Wizard? Summon a Rabbit. That's the worst enemy for them. I still have nightmares *shudders*<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
