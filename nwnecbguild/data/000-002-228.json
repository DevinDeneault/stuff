Does that allow all the same bonuses (Ki Crit/Inc Multiplier/SWF) on the new weapon to apply immediately, or do they need to be 'earned'?<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks in advance<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If you do that, you will need to think about Improved Critical, Epic Weapon Focus, Weapon Spec, and Epic Weapon Spec, all the feats you took for your first weapon of choice. Note that I said you need to think about those feats, not that you <strong>must</strong> take them.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Am quite cross about the whole thing, actually - I had wanted to take Barbarian/WM and ended up with Fighter/WM simply because a Weapon <em>Master</em> can't specialise in that weapon - hence the extra feats, hence the initial question...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">That's great, Max - thank you. Doubly so because the build you put forward chimes pretty well with what I was looking at (for a pleasant change!), in that I'm mapping a WM25/F10/R5 (the 5 levels of Rogue are predominantly because I find splitting all the Tumble and UMD skills only twice seems both inelegant and - for want of a better word - unrealistic). I'd not intially planned on OW and Dev Crit, but the volume of bonus feats in epic seemed to dictate that I should. It does mean that I sacificed Knockdown and Imp Knockdown got sidelined (as much because of the number of Rogue levels as anything else). My first choice weapon was Greatsword, with a second WoC in Heavy Flail (I like a good bludgeon) with WF, WS and Imp Crit in that weapon also. I was aware that my saves wouldn't be of the highest order, but I'll have a proper look at your build and see where I can improve my putative one.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm not sure whether I'd be allowed to post mine now, however! Regardless, the joy is in the playing!<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT</strong></em> - Another question, I'm afraid: can I take both OWCrit and DevCrit at the same time - ie, at level 30, WM L16?<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT 2</strong></em> - Don't bother, I've changed my mind - binning second WoC, so can rearrange things more neatly.<br/>\n<br/>\n ~Magic is impressive, but now Minsc leads - swords for everyone!~<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">If you're doing 2 weapons, choose a 1-handed weapon (with a shield) and a 2 handed weapon, like scimitar and heavy flail, for more flexibility. With the heavy flail, don't bother with Improved Crit, Ov Crit and Dev Crit,  but do take EWF, WS /EWS (and of course the WF that you must take as a prerequisite). The heavy flail would be taking advantage of the extra AB from WM, crushing those with crit immunity. As always, also carry a ranged weapon even if you're terrible with it, for those rare occasions when you need one.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
