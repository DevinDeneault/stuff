      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hello everyone, I've visited these forums several times over the years but have only just made an account because I'd like to see if you all can help me with a build for a new character concept that I want to play. The idea for this character is that he will be a Vhaeraun worshipping Drow Cleric. I was looking at the build listed here (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/515410/Monk-6Cleric-1618Fighter-86-Arelith#.V1DrrJErJhE\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/51 ... 1DrrJErJhE</a>) and I like the feel of the concept, however Monk is out of the question because I cannot be a cleric of Vhaeraun and be a lawful alignment. Here are some other things to keep in mind:<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#ECF3F7\">1) PvM or PvP - Builds that are maximized for PvM are often not maximized for dueling with other PCs.</span><br/>\n Balanced PvM and PvP; The character is a Drow and will likely see a bit of both.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#ECF3F7\">2) Level cap - What is the maximum level that the build (or server) will likely reach?</span><br/>\n 30<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#ECF3F7\">3) Race preference - Unless a class demands a specific race or races, Human will be assumed. Otherwise, specify the your favorite.</span><br/>\n Drow<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#ECF3F7\">4) Class preference - Describe which class(es) you have been considering so far and why. Your own concept is key to building what will do the job and be the most fun for you to play.</span><br/>\n Cleric is a must, whatever else you use to fill out the build is up to you<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#ECF3F7\">5) Melee preference - A few options to consider are: dual-wielding vs. one-hand with shield, high AC dexterity-based vs. high-damage strength-based, sneak attacks (stealth), taunting, specialized attacks (e.g. whirlwind, knockdown, called shots, sneaks, death attacks... you name it!).</span><br/>\n Dual-Wielding is preferred, but I know this can be hard with the restrictions<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#ECF3F7\">6) Range preference - DEX archery or Zen Archery (WIS)</span><br/>\n Character will be mostly melee<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#ECF3F7\">7) Weapon preference - Which weapon type would you enjoy using the most?</span><br/>\n Scimitar<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#ECF3F7\">8) Maximum item enhancement - In the setting where you intend to play this character, what is the highest enchantment (or bonus) that is likely to be used on equipment?</span><br/>\n +3<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#ECF3F7\">9) Spellcasting - If you are requesting a build that is likely to use magic, explain its general use. Will it be used primarily to add enhancements to a physical base attack (i.e. for buffing), to cast strong offensive spells or a balance of both areas of expertise? If arcane-based, would you prefer to be able to cast spells reliably while wearing armor? Is indispellability of buffs an important consideration?</span><br/>\n The build I'm looking for is to be a sort of Battlecleric, thus reaching level 9 or epic spells is not a necessity<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#ECF3F7\">10) Custom factors - Are there any special conditions that will affect how the build will work where you intend to play it? A PRC server is one example of a custom environment. Many servers have their own modifications to the standard game which will factor into the devising of a solid character build. Also, some community modules set their own rules</span><br/>\n The server i paly on is Arelith, so the standard restrictions for that apply. The biggest of which is the 3 level rule where you must take at least 3 levels into the new class your plan to multiclass into before you can take levels in other classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n Hopefully I have provided enough information to give you guys something to work with. I'll keep a close watch on this forum to answer any further questions that arise.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks in advance!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

What is the favored class of drow on Arelith? IIRC it could be Cleric else I'm thinking of another server.<br/>\n<br/>\n There are many ways to go here.\u00a0 Look towards some finessable attack. CoT is out with asn.\u00a0 If clc is favored for drow, any non-evil clc/rog/CoT works but limits weapon choice to probably S/S rapier or DW handaxes (assuming there are enough feats to go DW w/o sacrificing essentials.\u00a0 But non-evil for a drow?\u00a0 Dunno how much RP enters the picture.<br/>\n<br/>\n Problem with clc/ftr/asn is that 1) lots of skills to xclass to reach the 8 stealth ranks to qualify and 2) if clc not favored, then need to keep clc-to-ftr within 1 level.<br/>\n<br/>\n Recent testing has proved that a cleric who focuses on Darkness is extremely powerful when delivering sneaks/DAs.

An STR build is counter-productive for a DP cleric because most of the DEX AC and stealth will be washed out.\u00a0 And there are other issues with the class split.<br/>\n<br/>\n For example, an Epic Dodge (@Lvl 27) clc12/ftr4/rog14 has high XP penalty using elf's unfavorable class bias (wizard).\u00a0 You still haven't indicated the favored class for Drow so assume it is the same as elf.\u00a0 Ftr and CoT are the only feat \"feeders\" but since CoT is out of consideration, your evil bias forces the penalty.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Ranger requires 9 levels to achieve what a fighter can in 6 as far as DWing goes and ftr not limited to light armor.\u00a0 If you go scimi/shield or STR DW, ranger is even a worse choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n It is looking like you will need to decide between scimi and DWing.\u00a0 Choose one. Assassin still looks like the best choice because at least you avoid -40% XP penalty.\u00a0 Ignore the DC altogether and focus on skill dumps, avoiding XP penalty and get the same sneak damage but Epic Dodge is not part of clc/ftr/asn recipe.<br/>\n<br/>\n edit: just ninja'd before posting.\u00a0 Hmmm... so the clc/ftr/rog poses no XP penalty issue on Arelith then?\u00a0 Very unusual.\u00a0 Then choose your favorite martial finessable weapon and we will examine the trade-offs between DWing and S/S.<br/>\n<br/>\n Something like this for the earliest ED possible, high-stealth with pre-epic BAB 15 ...<br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\n<br/>\n Fighter(4), Rogue(14), Cleric(12), Elf/Drow (Any alignment)<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 8<br/>\n DEX: 18 (26)<br/>\n CON: 10<br/>\n WIS: 16<br/>\n INT: 14<br/>\n CHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Rogue(1): Blind Fight<br/>\n 02: Rogue(2)<br/>\n 03: Rogue(3): Knockdown<br/>\n 04: Fighter(1): DEX+1, Weapon Focus: Rapier, (DEX=19)<br/>\n 05: Fighter(2): Weapon Finesse<br/>\n 06: Fighter(3): Expertise<br/>\n 07: Cleric(1): Doms War (or Animal)/Travel (or Strength or Trickery)<br/>\n 08: Cleric(2): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br/>\n 09: Cleric(3): Improved Knockdown<br/>\n 10: Cleric(4)<br/>\n 11: Cleric(5)<br/>\n 12: Cleric(6): DEX+1, Improved Critical: Rapier, (DEX=21)<br/>\n 13: Cleric(7)<br/>\n 14: Cleric(8)<br/>\n 15: Cleric(9): Extend Spell<br/>\n 16: Cleric(10): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br/>\n 17: Cleric(11)<br/>\n 18: Rogue(4): Empower Spell<br/>\n 19: Rogue(5)<br/>\n 20: Rogue(6): DEX+1, (DEX=23)<br/>\n 21: Rogue(7): Epic Weapon Focus: Rapier<br/>\n 22: Rogue(8)<br/>\n 23: Rogue(9)<br/>\n 24: Rogue(10): DEX+1, Great Dex, Improved Evasion, (DEX=25)<br/>\n 25: Rogue(11)<br/>\n 26: Rogue(12)<br/>\n 27: Rogue(13): Epic Dodge, Defensive Roll<br/>\n 28: Cleric(12): DEX+1, (DEX=26)<br/>\n 29: Rogue(14)<br/>\n 30: Fighter(4): Epic Prowess, Armor Skin<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Note that the final Ftr level comes very late to enable early ED and late Disc dump.\u00a0 Else, take Ftr 4 at 24 or 27 for earlier Disc dump with ED at 30.<br/>\n (I assume you might be able to gift some additional DEX into the build.)<br/>\n<br/>\n ... else a DW STR version w/shorties (or light hammers, maces, handaxes) but significantly less skilled<br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\n<br/>\n Fighter(12), Rogue(6), Cleric(12), Elf/Drow (Any alignment)<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 14 (24)<br/>\n DEX: 14 (15)<br/>\n CON: 10<br/>\n WIS: 16<br/>\n INT: 14<br/>\n CHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Rogue(1): Blind Fight<br/>\n 02: Rogue(2)<br/>\n 03: Rogue(3): Knockdown<br/>\n 04: Fighter(1): DEX+1 (15), WF: Shortsword<br/>\n 05: Fighter(2): Ambidexterity<br/>\n 06: Fighter(3): TWF<br/>\n 07: Cleric(1): Doms Trickery/Travel<br/>\n 08: Cleric(2): STR+1 (15)<br/>\n 09: Cleric(3): Extend Spell<br/>\n 10: Cleric(4)<br/>\n 11: Cleric(5)<br/>\n 12: Cleric(6): STR+1 (16), ITWF<br/>\n 13: Cleric(7)<br/>\n 14: Cleric(8)<br/>\n 15: Cleric(9): ImpCrit: Shortsword<br/>\n 16: Cleric(10): STR+1 (17)<br/>\n 17: Cleric(11)<br/>\n 18: Rogue(4): Empower Spell<br/>\n 19: Rogue(5)<br/>\n 20: Fighter(4): STR+1 (18), WS: Shortsword<br/>\n 21: Fighter(5): Grt Str (19)<br/>\n 22: Fighter(6): EWF: Shortsword<br/>\n 23: Fighter(7)<br/>\n 24: Fighter(8): STR+1 (20), Grt Str (21), Epic Prowess<br/>\n 25: Cleric(12)<br/>\n 26: Fighter(9)<br/>\n 27: Fighter(10): Grt Str (22), Armor Skin<br/>\n 28: Fighter(11): STR+1 (23)<br/>\n 29: Rogue(6)<br/>\n 30: Fighter(12): Grt Str (24), EWS: Shortsword<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Morphing this into scimi/board would be rather easy and gain 3 feats (possibly PA/Cleave and IKD) that route.<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I wonder if the feats could be changed to pick up IKD...but I'm not sure whether the tradeoff is worth it or if it is even possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">Since you are ignoring stealth, that opens up a lot of skill ranks and you have done a decent job figuring out how to spread them out.\u00a0 Using the bias you've provided, this is my version:<br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\n<br/>\n Concentration 33(33), Discipline 33(40), Heal 30(33), Spellcraft 28(30), Tumble 30(32), UMD 32(31)<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Heal(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(28)<br/>\n 02: Heal(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(35)<br/>\n 03: Heal(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(42)<br/>\n 04: Concentration(7), Discipline(7), Heal(1), Save(31)<br/>\n 05: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(32)<br/>\n 06: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(33)<br/>\n 07: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(7), Save(28)<br/>\n 08: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(29)<br/>\n 09: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(30)<br/>\n 10: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(31)<br/>\n 11: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(32)<br/>\n 12: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(33)<br/>\n 13: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(34)<br/>\n 14: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(35)<br/>\n 15: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(36)<br/>\n 16: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(37)<br/>\n 17: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(38)<br/>\n 18: Heal(1), Tumble(15), UMD(15), Save(17)<br/>\n 19: Heal(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(24)<br/>\n 20: Concentration(3), Discipline(14), Heal(1), Save(10)<br/>\n 21: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(11)<br/>\n 22: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(12)<br/>\n 23: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(13)<br/>\n 24: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Heal(1), Save(14)<br/>\n 25: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(11), Save(5)<br/>\n 26: Concentration(1), Discipline(2), Heal(1), Save(5)<br/>\n 27: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Save(7)<br/>\n 28: Concentration(1), Save(10)<br/>\n 29: Tumble(8), UMD(10), Save(2)<br/>\n 30: Concentration(2), Discipline(4)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Not being familiar with Arelith, you seem to have placed a priority on the Heal skill so I have incorporated it likewise.\u00a0 For most environments, though, I would have shifted all those points over to Listen to help detect invisibles and hiddens approaching.\u00a0 You would know better than I the relative value of those skills on your server.\u00a0 But even ignoring the bias, you still should want the saves vs. spells as high as possible since this build is not structured for high-saves (my sheet shows F/W/R of 17/17/15 and 23/23/21 vs spells) but just barely enough.\u00a0 Your divine buffs will help some as will scrolls of <em>Protection from Spells</em> (+8 vs. spells if available) but that is certainly not the focus of this build.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Blind Fight</em> is possibly the singlemost important melee feat in existence.\u00a0 Check the <strong><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Blind_fight\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wiki description</a></strong> to get a better feel of what your toon will be exposing itself to without it.\u00a0 TBH, I even started using the feat with my dedicated archers because they waste too much expensive ammo trying to hit shadows and other concealed types without it.\u00a0 With that annoying drain touch attack looming, it's important to dispatch those races quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\n UMD:\u00a0 So are you telling me Arelith doesn't use the standard scroll check?\u00a0 If it doesn't, you can get by with just enough for a value check and item valuation depends on the server.\u00a0 Level 9 scrolls are usually somewhere in the 3k to 4K gold range which means a UMD of about modified 5 is plenty.\u00a0 But that doesn't address the value of rods, wands and other more expensive magical items that might bolster your buffing potential.\u00a0 The most important UMD advantage for a cleric is to gain access to mantles and even better... BREACHES!\u00a0 It's the only way a non-arcanist has to lower enemy SR other than druid's <em>Nature's Balance</em>.\u00a0 At Level 31, and with the standard scroll check in effect you will be able to cast spells by scroll up to Level 7.\u00a0 Beyond that level, scrolls have a +5% extra failure rate per level (i.e. at UMD 31, a Level 9 scroll would have a 10% chance of fizzling dead when used).<br/>\n<br/>\n TBH, this build, even with all those fighter levels, is still feat-starved in pre-epic (which is where you would be taking IKD, +save feats, skill focus, etc.).\u00a0 A DP cleric needs to keep pre-epic BAB below 16 and any more fighter levels would put this toon over.\u00a0 You really need <strong>all</strong> those I've outlined.\u00a0 <em>Extend</em> for lengths for your primary buffs and <em>Empower</em> to boost your abilities as high as possible (Empowered Healing Circle is also very sweet around mobs of undead).\u00a0 Nope.\u00a0 I don't see any wiggle room which why I discarded the DEX version.\u00a0 There is simply no room to insert Weapon Finesse without losing a crucial proficiency for most situations.\u00a0 Now, a single hand option? Yes.\u00a0 A few more feats to choose from.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

With Tumble, you get +1 AC from every 5 base ranks in Tumble, not the net score, unlike Spellcraft or UMD. On the other hand, if you can get your Spellcraft to 33 (or 28), your net score would be a multiple of 5, which is what you need for another +1 to saves against spells.<br/>\n My favorite place to dump left-over skill points is Lore, so I don't have to trek to a merchant and waste 100 old to identify something.

The only other option is to delay final Clc 12 until Level 30 to get 33 (35) for +7 vs spells.\u00a0 It's your own preferance whether the extra slots for level 5 &amp; 6 spells five levels earlier is more playable or not. Decide how much your capped toon will be played to make that choice.\u00a0 That is more of a PvP issue.\u00a0 How this build will perform in duels is anybody's guess as it was not designed with that in mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n If Arelith doesn't use the hardcore scroll check then set UMD at whatever level is needed to use the equipment/wands you have your eye on. Since I have no idea how your server sets gold value for each property, only you can make that assessment.\u00a0 Vanilla UMD uses 300K, 600K &amp; 1M gold for levels 20, 25 &amp; 30, respectively for class emulation.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
