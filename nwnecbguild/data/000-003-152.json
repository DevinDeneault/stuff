      "content": "<div>Looking to play a weapon master using a rapier/scimitar and shield that can take advantage of divine might/shield, divine favor, and greater magic weapon. I've been going back and forth between STR and CHA based paladins, swapping in and out fighter and champion of torm, and generally pulling my hair out. This is for Arelith, so we're capped at level 30 and it's a relatively low magic world. The first three levels of a new class have to be taken all together before switching to another class, and we can use gifts to boost three different stats by 2. The closest I've come to being happy with this idea is a human Paladin 15/Fighter 8/WM 7. If you want to get creative, there's a few custom classes that could be considered:<br/>\n - Harper Paragon, a harper scout path that automatically grants divine grace, divine might, and divine shield across levels 1 through 5. Harper paragons add their full Harper level to arcane and divine spellcasting. All normal Harper features are lost except for the bonus feats.<br/>\n - Harper Priest, another variant that adds +3 effective levels for Turn Undead at level 2. Harper priests add their full Harper level to divine spellcasting. I think there's some other minor bonuses but I can't check right now.<br/>\n - Favoured Soul, a bard path that trades bard song for 0% arcane spell failure and an unlimited number of spells per day (spells have a cooldown after being cast related to their level).<br/>\n<br/>\n I feel like I need divine favor, GMW, and taunt in order to have a competitive AB for PvP. And\u00a0I guess I don't have to have divine might, but I just want to see a crap load of divine damage when my holy warrior hits. Is that so much to ask? Is cleric possible here? Should I go the great smiting route instead?</div>"

      "content": "<div>Welcome aboard the guild community, mate!\u00a0 So glad you were able to find us <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/11.gif\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n Whenever someone indicates a low-magic world, I immediately think caster class.\u00a0 In this case, that would be a self-buffing cleric, however...<br/>\n<br/>\n The question you need to ask yourself is: How bad do I desire the ability to smite and taunt?\u00a0 If the answer to both these preferences is VERY DESIRABLE, then you are stuck with either Pally or BG. Clerics don't taunt.\u00a0 Well, not very well anyway and certainly don't smite.<br/>\n<br/>\n The main problem is that you will allocating to too many abilities at once:\u00a0 STR 13 (for PA/DM/DS), DEX 13 (for Dodge/WM) CHA 13 (for DM/DS), INT 13 (for Expertise/WM) and WIS 14+ (minimum buffing) and without at least WIS 16-18, you will have fewer buff slots even as pally.\u00a0 So you see how thin the spread will be just to enable WM in combo with DM/DS?<br/>\n<br/>\n The one class that can compensate for a lowish primary attack ability is cleric. The key advantages over pally are Battletide +2 AB (+2 AC vs enemy attack) and Divine Power (full BAB attack) not to mention True Seeing, Magic Vest, Darkfire, Neg nrg Protect... etc... buffs that can make up for lack of enhancements on gear especially on low-magic PWs.<br/>\n<br/>\n The only real trick I see designing a ftr/clc/wm is keeping pre-epic BAB no higher than 15 to exploit DP to its fullest.\u00a0 But it's your choice.\u00a0 You are the one that will be playing it and if there is a thematic reason for preference it could cost potential.<br/>\n<br/>\n edit: as expected, BAB is too high for full exploit without losing important feats.\u00a0 It looks like this:<br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\n<br/>\n Clc(15), Ftr(8), WM(7); Any Alignment Human<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 13 (18)<br/>\n DEX: 13<br/>\n CON: 10<br/>\n WIS: 14 (17)<br/>\n INT: 14<br/>\n CHA: 14<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Ftr(1): Dodge, WF, Blind Fight<br/>\n 02: Ftr(2): PA<br/>\n 03: Ftr(3): Expertise<br/>\n 04: Clc(1): STR+1 (14), Doms Travel/War (or whatever)<br/>\n 05: Clc(2)<br/>\n 06: Clc(3): Divine Might<br/>\n 07: Clc(4)<br/>\n 08: Clc(5): STR+1 (15)<br/>\n 09: Clc(6): Divine Shield (KD?)<br/>\n 10: Clc(7)<br/>\n 11: Clc(8)<br/>\n 12: Clc(9): WIS+1 (15), Extend Spell<br/>\n 13: Clc(10)<br/>\n 14: Clc(11)<br/>\n 15: Clc(12): Empower Spell<br/>\n 16: Clc(13): WIS+1 (16)<br/>\n 17: Ftr(4): Mobility<br/>\n 18: Ftr(5): Spring Attack<br/>\n 19: Ftr(6): WWA<br/>\n 20: Ftr(7): WIS+1, (WIS=17)<br/>\n - - - - - - -<br/>\n 21: WM(1): EWF, WoC<br/>\n 22: WM(2)<br/>\n 23: WM(3)<br/>\n 24: Ftr(8): STR+1 (16), WS, EWS<br/>\n 25: WM(4)<br/>\n 26: WM(5)<br/>\n 27: WM(6): Armor Skin<br/>\n 28: WM(7): STR+1 (17)<br/>\n 29: Clc(14)<br/>\n 30: Clc(15): Grt STR (18)<br/>\n<br/>\n HP: 270 (390 w/Emp Endure)<br/>\n<br/>\n Saeves (F/W/R): 18/18/12 (25/25/19 v spells)<br/>\n BAB: 21 (16 pre + 5 epic)<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 29 (melee), 22 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 16/27<br/>\n<br/>\n Skills<br/>\n Discipline 31(35), Heal 32(35) (or Conc vs. taunters), Intimidate 4(6), Listen 31(34), Spellcraft 33(35), Tumble 15(16)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Fortunately, Emp Endure raises HP up to near 400 HP and the +20 AB cap is easily reached by buff bringing AB to 49 or higher with some minor +STR gear. AC will be HUGE with combo of Magic Vestx2 plus DS and deflection shield.\u00a0 Expertise lends another +5 AC but seriously doubt you'd be needing it with all that AC already.\u00a0 Personally, I'd trade DS in for KD in a heartbeat as feat-starved as this build becomes with all the WM prereqs. Save all those turn attempts for raising damage total.\u00a0 Domains &amp; skills allocated somewhat randomly without more intimate knowledge of what the server provides enhancement-wise.<br/>\n<br/>\n Ummm... unless Arelith has changed alignments of vanilla base classes, there is no legal way to combo Pally with bard.\u00a0 As for those other custom classes mentioned, I'll leave it to you to consider the possibilities since I have no clue how to design around them.</div>"
