      "content": "<div>This one is a very unique build that i had sitting in my vault for quite a long time and althought it is best if you play it in any environment that has boosted somewhat the PDK abilities (such as WoG), it is quite strong anywhere, and because the core of the build is based upon thirty fighter levels it has a very large customiuzation potencial for everyone's needs. While playing the build, i found it to be suprisingly powerful and easy to level and it was even better when i had my teammates at my side cause i was doing tricks with PDK abilities, craft potions for fighters without UMD and so on. The role of charisma in this build is crucial if you play in WoG, or anywhere else that PDK abilities depent on it, or else you can dump it to the starting values and rise your strength instead.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-size:150%;line-height:normal\">THE HARPER KNIGHT</span><br/>\n (FIGHTER 30/ PDK 5/ HS 5)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://i1375.photobucket.com/albums/ag474/valerfor/compatriots_by_michael_c_hayes-d51rn1w_zpsae3a6119.jpg\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n RACE: Human<br/>\n<br/>\n ALIGNMENT: Lawful Neutral (smite proof)<br/>\n<br/>\n PLAYABILITY: PvM 1-40 (he greatly benefits a party)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n STARTING/ ENDING STATS:<br/>\n<br/>\n STR - 16\u00a0 (32)<br/>\n DEX - 08<br/>\n CON - 16<br/>\n INT - 14.<br/>\n WIS - 08<br/>\n CHA - 12<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Hit Points: 580<br/>\n<br/>\n Skill Points: 225<br/>\n<br/>\n Concentration: 43 (46)<br/>\n Discipline: 43 (64)<br/>\n Listen: 6 (7)<br/>\n Lore: 23 (30)<br/>\n Intimidate: 1 (2)<br/>\n Persuade: 8 (9)<br/>\n Ride: 2 (3)<br/>\n Search: 4 (7)<br/>\n Spot: 2 (3)<br/>\n Tumble: 40 (39)<br/>\n Spellcraft: 18 (20)<br/>\n<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fort/Ref/Will):\u00a0 31/ 16/ 22\u00a0 \u2192\u00a0 35/ 20/ 26\u00a0 (saves Vs spells &amp; HS abilities)<br/>\n<br/>\n Naked /Armored AC:\u00a0 21/ 32\u00a0 (With mundane Full Plate &amp; Tower Shield and Cats' Grace)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n BAB: 30 (Four attacks)<br/>\n<br/>\n AB: +45/ +40/ +35/ +30 (Longsword)<br/>\n<br/>\n DMG: 1d8 + 17 / 17-20 x 2 (Longsword)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Devastating Critical DC: 41 (47)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Crafting of Harper Potions ( Haste, Invisibility, Bull's, Cat's, UV, Cl/Cv )<br/>\n<br/>\n HS spells: Cat's grace &amp; Eagle's splendor each 1/ day (stackable) &amp; Invisibility 1/ day<br/>\n<br/>\n HS abilities: Deneir's Eye (+2 Vs Traps), Lliira's Heart (+2 Vs Mind effects), Tymora's Smile (+2 to all saves)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n PDK abilities: Rallying cry 3/ day (all allies get +1 attack/ +20% movement speed), Heroic shield ( +4AC to an ally) - this can be always ON<br/>\n<br/>\n Inspire courage 2/ day (all allies get +1 attack/ damage, +2 vs mind effects for 10 rounds), Oath of wrath 1/ day ( +2 attack/ damage/ saves/ skills) - duration 10 rounds<br/>\n<br/>\n PDK Fear (Huge radius, DC 26 (32), lasts 40 rounds), Final stand 1/ day (all allies get 2d10 hit points)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n LEVELING GUIDE:<br/>\n<br/>\n 01) Fighter (01): Luck of Heroes, Weapon Focus: Longsword, Expertise<br/>\n 02) Fighter (02): Power Attack<br/>\n 03) Fighter (03): Cleave<br/>\n 04) Fighter (04): Knockdown<br/>\n 05) Fighter (05):<br/>\n 06) Fighter (06): Iron Will, Weapon Specialization: Longsword<br/>\n 07) Fighter (07):<br/>\n 08) Fighter (08): Improved Critical: Longsword<br/>\n 09) Fighter (09): Alertness<br/>\n 10) Fighter (10): Improved Knockdown<br/>\n 11) Fighter (11):<br/>\n 12) Fighter (12): Mounted Combat, Blind Fight<br/>\n 13) Fighter (13):<br/>\n 14) Fighter (14): Improved Expertise<br/>\n 15) Fighter (15): Great Cleave<br/>\n 16) PDK (01):<br/>\n 17) PDK (02):<br/>\n 18) PDK (03): Toughness<br/>\n 19) PDK (04):<br/>\n 20) PDK (05):<br/>\n 21) Fighter (16): Great Strength I, Epic Weapon Focus: Longsword<br/>\n 22) HS (01): Epic Skill Focus: Discipline<br/>\n 23) HS (02):<br/>\n 24) Fighter (17): Great Strength II<br/>\n 25) Fighter (18): Overwhelming Critical: Longsword<br/>\n 26) Fighter (19):<br/>\n 27) HS (03): Epic Fortitude<br/>\n 28) Fighter (20): Devastating Critical: Longsword<br/>\n 29) Fighter (21):<br/>\n 30) Fighter (22): Great Strength III, Epic Weapon Specialization: Longsword<br/>\n 31) Fighter (23):<br/>\n 32) HS (04):<br/>\n 33) Fighter (24): Great Strength IV, Armour Skin<br/>\n 34) Fighter (25):<br/>\n 35) Fighter (26): Epic prowess<br/>\n 36) Fighter (27): Great Strength V<br/>\n 37) HS (05): Epic Will<br/>\n 38) Fighter (28): Epic Toughness I<br/>\n 39) Fighter (29): Great Strength VI<br/>\n 40) Fighter (30): Epic Toughness II<br/>\n<br/>\n FINAL NOTES:<br/>\n<br/>\n You may want to notice that in WoG some of the PDK abilities are based also on your charisma for their duration. Heroic Shield is the most important of them, since it is an instant feat that requires no activation time at all and it lasts your PDK levels plaus your charisma modifier (that you can self-buff quite easily too). So, it basically allows you to give all your party (not yourself) +4 dodge AC per round. Now since the AC bonus is dodge and the feat is instant, it stacks with itself, basically with some training and a buffed charisma you can give an incredible ammount of AC to all your allies, practically permanently.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Ok, I'm gonna be honest here.<br/>\n<br/>\nHarper Scout sucks in this build.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere, I said it. Sorry, but it is really meh!<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, there are other Classes one can stick in here, with less levels and more \"bang for the buck\" - like Rogue.<br/>\n<br/>\n2 levels vs 5 gets UMD and Tumble, plus a bit of stabby AND 3 extra levels of Fighter, for example. Dunno what 3 more levels of Rogue might bring with it - I don't really play them.<br/>\n<br/>\nTraps, I suppose (and some more stabby).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd while the Potions from HS are pretty good (esp. on WoG!), one a rest period is...very limiting.\u00a0 If one has oodles of time, one could make a pretty good stock, I suppose, but man!\u00a0 That is gonna be one HUGE a$$ time-sink for a party-orientated character!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe PDK side looks sunnier - esp. on WoG!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt brought out an interesting aspect of PDK - as Familiar and Summons buffer!\u00a0 I can imagine PDK really synergizing well with a Sorcerer (due to the Cha...holy crud! O_0).<br/>\n<br/>\n\u00a0I'm going to be testing this.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it works like I expect, it will make Epic Mummy Warrior into a nice meat shield!\u00a0 20 extra AC would really, REALLY pump it up!\u00a0 <br/>\n<br/>\nI am wondering how this will work with the Pixie, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, I tested this with my Exalted Sorceress - replacing Paladin with PDK.<br/>\n<br/>\nI then summoned my Epic Mummy Warrior and buffed his AC to 51 (from 26)!<br/>\n<br/>\nYikes!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat a brute!<br/>\n<br/>\nWith her mega Cha (took 5 rounds to do due to the 1/round limit on WoG) that still left 14-5=9 rounds left!<br/>\n<br/>\nSince doing these are unlimited times a day...holy crud!</div>"

      "content": "<div>I really like this build. While I don\u2019t disagree with Webshaman about the HS usefulness, I will say this:  I noticed you listed WoG potions for what the Harper can craft. Incidentally they\u2019re now called Grey Wardens there. But I digress. There\u2019s two other small changes I noticed to the class. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re posted anywhere but I noticed this in game. Harpers gain 6 skill points per level, and they picked up 2 additional skills:  Search and Spellcraft. <br/>\n<br/>\nJust a tidbit for you to chew on. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut this an excellent build. Great party leader. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk</div>"
