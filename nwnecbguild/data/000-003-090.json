I was intending to take the extra gifts of +2 endurance and +2 intellect. I would like to try and get as many epic spell focuses as possible, while including the spells epic mummy dust and Epic Dragon Knight. I also wouldn't mind having a focus around the flesh to stone spell or possibly just using summoned creatures to take me to max level. I look forward to hearing what suggestions you folks have. Thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\n -Jack Bauer</span><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">It's not the ability level but the ability <span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>modifier</strong></span> that affects DC.\u00a0 +1 ability affects nothing (except +1 STR does boost towing capacity).\u00a0 +2 ability raises the modifier by 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt calculates like this: DC = 10 + spell level + ability <span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>modifier</strong></span> + feat modifier. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo,  using a dual spell focus example (many ppl like to take evoc and necro  so we'll use those for an example), it would take 4 pre-epic feats (SpF: Evoc/GSpF:  Evoc and SpF: Necro/GSpF: Necro ) to qualify to take Epic SpF: Evoc and  Epic SpF: Necro.\u00a0 The epic foci would raise Evoc and Necro spells by  DC 2. The other schools' DCs would gain nothing. \u00a0 However, if you chose Grt INT x 2 instead, it would raise <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">all</span>  schools by the modifier, 1.\u00a0 In the first case, you'd gain +1 DC in the 2  focused schools over the corresponding investment in Grt INTx2 but the remaining  schools would remain at status quo.\u00a0 <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, it comes down to how  dedicated you intend your spellcasting to be.\u00a0 With little diversion  away from the 2 focused schools, it's best to invest in their corresponding epic  focus.\u00a0 With a wide spectrum of spellcasting using spells that allow  saves, it's best to focus on your primary ability using Grt Ability  bumps, if given the choice, to boost all schools evenly.<br/>\n<br/>\nDC does not rely on \"natural\" ability modifier so if you can reach the +12 ability cap by a combo of item props and (in this case) Empowered Fox Cunning pre-buff (up to +7 INT), you'll be able to raise the DCs of all schools by +6.\u00a0 Empowered Fox should be an automatic pre-buff for all high-WIZ types.<br/>\n<br/>\nA good tactic to optimize success of FtoS is to precede it with <em>Bestow Curs</em>e, another Transmutation.\u00a0 That spell saves vs. Will which is typically very low on warrior types.\u00a0 When you follow-up with FtoS, you'll gain a 1 point advantage (modifier) by lowering the CON of the foe by 2 points.\u00a0 Fort is the hardest save to beat with warrior types, especially CoTs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI agree somewhat about the Drow subrace INT boost advantage.\u00a0 The problem with with elven spellcasters is that they give up Fort with the racial bias, so in a theoretical Fort duel between elven wiz and human wiz (or dwarven wiz, for that matter), elves should lose most of the time due to their racial CON penalty.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
