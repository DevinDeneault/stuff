      "content": "<div>Now this is another one intended to be an enjoyable build to play, rather than a spectacular one. So if you're hoping for a high CHA, casting Bard, you might want to look away now, 'cause this ain't it. This is a gruff little dwarf who happens to have the voice of an angel.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe's a party-player more than a loner (he likes an audience), and he has his favourite numbers. For Song, his standards are <em>King of the Swingers</em> by King Louis, <em>What a Wonderful World</em> by Louis Armstrong, and <em>Reasons to be Cheerful</em> by Ian Dury. Equally, his Curse standards are <em>The Ace of Spades</em> by Motorhead, <em>Thunderstruck</em> by AC/DC, and <em>21st Century Schizoid Man</em> by King Crimson. Then he has his two floor-fillers: <em>Oops, Upside Your Head</em> by the Gap Band, and <em>If I Had a Hammer (Oh, I do)</em> by Pete Seeger, with adaptations by Klef himself.<br/>\n<br/>\nEssentially, all he does is sing and hit things that need a good hitting.

Admittedly, I was my normal perverse self in going for a dwarf (I did think about Half-Orc for a moment), but some of that was about the challenge of seeing whether I could still make good use of the Song while retaining pretty much all the \"necessary\" melee feats. Also, It irks me that Lasting Inspiration normally has to wait until well into the 30's before it's taken in many cases.
