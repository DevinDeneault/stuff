Admittedly, the challenge is probably down to this being a dumb idea, but bear with me for now, please.<br/>\n<br/>\n This might come across as somewhat quirky, but I've been wondering recently about constructing LotR's Peregrine Took's hallowed ancestor, Bandobras - the \"Bullroarer\" - Took. Then I started wondering about the state of my life, but I digress. Many combinations crossed my mind - including PDK, because he reportedly rode a pig into battle against the goblins (and yes, I know the P doesn't stand for pig) - but in the end I thought Barbarian / CoT / Rogue. Barb 'cos he's big and scary (for a halfling), CoT 'cos he's their champion aqgainst the forces of darkness, and Rogue 'cos i) he won't get clattered for an xp penalty and ii) he will get UMD and more juicy skills. But here's the clincher - he should be STR-based: either sword'n'board or 2-handed.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, there's the concept. And here's the challenge: can anyone make something half-decent from it? I'll be trying as well, but I thought we could do with a brain-teaser.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks. I get what you say about environment completely, and given that it's me making the request, I should probably have expanded somewhat.<br/>\n<br/>\n I play SP pretty much all the time (hoping to revive my sojourn into PWs, but my buddy still has some RL issues to deal with, and I wouldn't want to leave him behind), in, I would guess, mostly mid to high-magic environs, but rising to high in mid-epic. By which I mean very little beyond +3 gear/weaponry until epic levels, +5 to approx level 30, then up to +7/8 after about level 35. Essentially, mostly Aielund, some SoU/HotU/SoF, a lot less OC than used to be the case, but but still take it if I do Aribeth's Redemption (depends on alignment and race at the end of the OC). Recently embarked on Swordflight, and am finding it seriously tough but rewarding, and have ventured into Adam Miller's campaign but didn't find it terribly rewarding - probably more to do with me trying classes I was uncomfortable with than the campaign per se.<br/>\n<br/>\n My instinct is towards the DR route (and not just for the humour), though I always seem drawn to CoT for saves and feats (not so bothered about CHA and Wrath - ugly and unhittable trumps pretty and a bit cross in my book). But I'm open to suggestion - seriously, this is about trying to find a quality, STR-based halfing build. Trying for something different. If it doesn't pan out, at least we've tried, eh?<br/>\n<br/>\n Btw, I've been thinking about potential starting stats of STR 16, DEX 10, CON 14, WIS 8, INT 14 and CHA 10. I know I'll never get Mighty Rage, but Terrifying's still very much there with a possible Barb 24/26, CoT 10, Rogue 4/6 split.<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and I probably ought to mention that, as a SP proponent in particular, I like a build that's actually playable throughout (as opposed to viable, where the build only fully blossoms at level 40, or thereabouts).<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks for the interest.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Ninja'd yet again - twice this time! But both by good friends, so thanks, guys<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I know there's been some recent discussion about power-building and builds for RP, and this was always one of the latter. Yes, I'm looking for the best STR build available, but within certain parameters - and there's nothing to suggest that the Bullroarer had any arcane inclination or draconian blood in him. I gave my initial critique of the character traits earlier on, but if you have another take, excellent. I've been happy to see Harper Scout now featuring instead of Rogue, because it's a better conceptual fit - and that was part of the point: it was about marrying the concept with a different sort of build. I appreciate that reason has to be fairly flexible in the context of a creating a fictitious character in a separate and different fictitious world, but if <strong><em>we</em></strong> can't suspend disbelief, who on earth can?<br/>\n<br/>\n Regardless, cheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Now I know it's been a while, but I've been giving this one a bit of thought lately (mostly because I'm about to finalize the re-working of GDL's Hearth Guard, so wanted to tidy up other loose ends). I've taken on board Valerfor's suggested split - Barb 17 / CoT 18 / HS 5 and examined Rodent's first thoughts, as well as - in particular - Max's Champion of the Tribes (I'll spell out its location when this is finalized).<br/>\n<br/>\n There are some issues with the draft below, not least the AC and the lack of a \"complete\" detection skill, but I'd value your thoughts before taking him out for a ride. Particularly with respect to whether SkF in either/both Taunt or Intimidate or Expertise would trump the benefits from Power Attack (and thereby Cleave) - though Toughness might also be vulnerable to potential exchange. I'd also appreciate your thoughts on whether boosts to CHA might be preferable to STR ones (for Terry Rage and Divine Wrath purposes). I confess, if not for the RP nature of the build I'd have used the HS bonus feats for either a couple of Great CHAs or ESkFs in Taunt and Intimidate.<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, I'd be grateful for your (printable) thoughts.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Bullroarer Took - Barb 17 / CoT 18 / HS 5</strong><br/>\n Halfling, non-evil, non-lawful<br/>\n PvM 1-40<br/>\n<br/>\n STR 14 (30)<br/>\n DEX 12<br/>\n CON 14<br/>\n WIS 8<br/>\n INT 14<br/>\n CHA 14<br/>\n<br/>\n HPs: 534<br/>\n Saves: F 36, W 28, R31 (+2 v Fear-type effects, +4 v traps)<br/>\n AC: (naked) 22 (LShield + FPlate) 29<br/>\n DR: 3/-<br/>\n BAB: 30<br/>\n AB: (melee, club) 45 (ranged) 33 (34 with thrown weapons)<br/>\n SPs: 222.

Interestingly enough, Barb/CoT/Rogue was my initial concept in the OP, so I'm more than happy to buy into that! I hadn't built with HS before, and you know what it's like when you get a new toy - you just want to play with that one for a while. Equally, the starting stats are closer to those I was initially looking at, so again, pleased to take on board. Of course, losing HS also frees up a couple of feats, as well as a sizeable dollop of skills points, allowing for a complete detection skill and some UMD, with the Rogue addition.<br/>\n<br/>\n All in all, great feedback! I'll muck around with it a bit and get back to the Guild after testing.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I've just finished taking the Bullroarer through the OC and MTS and had an absolute blast with him. I have 2 confessions, however. First, I forgot to take any screenshots - but I will be taking him out again for the fun of him, so I'll try to remember next time. Second, because his AC was pretty dreadful, I didn't take club as his weapon. It's a two-hander for Hins, and he really needed a shield. Also, quality clubs are very thin on the ground (who'd have thunk it?). Instead, I went for mace. I figured it was in the spirit of the build, and I could both use a shield and pick up more quality items. Below is the final build I went with. And yes, at least one of the Expertise girls would have made sense, but hey, we're talking about a very cross, lunatic hobbit who rides a pig full-tilt into battle - sense doesn't come into it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Bandobras Took - \"The Bullroarer\"</strong><br/>\nBarbarian 28/ Champion of Tulkas 10/ Rogue 2<br/>\nHin: non-evil, non-lawful<br/>\n1-40 PvM<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Stats</strong><br/>\nSTR 16 (32)<br/>\nDEX 12<br/>\nCON 14<br/>\nWIS 8<br/>\nINT 14<br/>\nCHA 8<br/>\n<br/>\nHit Points: 568<br/>\nAC: (naked) 22, (full plate) 30, (+med shield) 32<br/>\nDR: 6/-<br/>\nSpeed: +10%<br/>\nSaves: Fort 31, Will 21, Reflex 26.
