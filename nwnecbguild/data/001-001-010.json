      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hello All,<br/>\n<br/>\n Unlike most threads in this Modules sub-forum, this is not yet a recommendation. It's a mod I've been aware of for some time, but only ventured into three times - never yet completing it (entirely down to me - the mod itself seems fine). But I'm now committed to finishing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n Regardless, I believe it deserves a thread of its own, if for no other reason that it's probably the only one that will take your character right through to level 40 - even the mighty Aielund Saga can only manage around level 37.<br/>\n<br/>\n Sands of Fate (SoF) consists of 3 mods - readily available from the NwN Vault - \"Shadows over Heliopolis\", \"Gem Tower\" and \"Pyramid of the Ancients\". They are all for epic characters, post HotU ideally. The first takes you up to cL30 and is set in \"an alien land of baking deserts and strange foes\". Your character from the end of HotU will be imported (with gear and loot), or you can create a L25 character to start it with. The blurb tells me that it's medium RP and Tricks/Traps, with Heavy Hack'n'Slash.<br/>\n<br/>\n The second part, which sees you\u00a0 returned to \"a desert land after a dormant force of evil\", gets you to about L35.<br/>\n<br/>\n And the third apparently allows a significant amount of level 40 play, wherein you venture to \"the pyramid whose pharaoh saved the land a 1000 years ago\".<br/>\n<br/>\n My understanding is that it is better for Good-aligned players, but the Vault leaves it open. I know Empyre and Valerfor have gone through the mods, and hope for some of their insights here - else it will end up being me running around as a headless chicken, clucking \"What now? What now?\" (except there is a walkthrough apparently as part of the download - so don't expect one here).<br/>\n<br/>\n Of course, if it's a crap idea for a thread, it'll soon sink.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers, y'all <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Good ideas, both, Empyre, thanks. I've a couple of questions about the Aribeth's Redemption route, though...<br/>\n<br/>\n One thing we didn't cover in the AR thread was whether it was Dwarf-enabled (I'm playing as my Hearth Guard variant - DwD22/CoT10/F8). I know it shouldn't be, thematically, but do you happen to know if it would work? Particularly as we established that the demise of the Lady Paladin in the OC doesn't prevent taking the mods, so it would appear some flexibility might be possible. Alignment wouldn't be an issue: I'm going LG anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n Second, would your gear transfer across to SoF in the same way it does from HotU?<br/>\n<br/>\n I thought about just launching myself into HotU, but I've never done anything other than start a character at L1 and keep going, so I'd need to know how this would work, sorry. Assuming the mod starts you at, for example, level18, does that mean you get to input your build's stats as they would be at that level had you played through to it? And, while I appreciate that gear isn't exactly an issue at the beginning of HotU, coin would be. How is that resolved, if at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n Apologies for further evidence of my ignorance...<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I'm afraid that Aribeth's redemption requires you to be Human, Elf, or Half-Elf.<br/>\n<br/>\n I never tried it, but I remember reading that you get leveled up at the beginning of HotU if your level is too low. The same applies to Sands of Fate, so you could skip straight to that if you want. Your gear would transfer to Sands of Fate no matter what you played before, but if your chosen skill level is higher than Normal, you keep only what you have equipped.<br/>\n<br/>\n If all else fails, there is Pretty Good Char Creator, which could bring you to your desired level, and help you get appropriate gear and money for that level. I would buy a Lens of Detection there.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">A shame about the Redemption route, but worth knowing about your gear being transferable for future reference. I just fancied a character with a very solid defence as well as a decent amount of power for my first full run-through (my intention is to not read the walkthrough unless thoroughly bamboozled), hence the DwD choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also useful to get the info on levelling, thanks. I do tend/try to play at one level above the Normal setting, so again, handy info.<br/>\n<br/>\n I keep meaning to download the Pretty Good thingy but haven't got round to it yet. Iirc, like me, you have Open Office rather than the Microsoft packages, so I assume it works ok with that - and thanks for the tip.<br/>\n<br/>\n As it stands, I'm now in the Host Tower at L14, so I reckon I'll bash on through this time.

You only have to worry about that in chapter 1. That's why I am usually either an RDD or a DEX-er in SoF.  Also, a weapon that does acid damage is very useful (desert folk), and later, you will benefit from a ranged weapon with either cold or fire damage (green slime).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I know there aren't any Dwarven axes available until HotU, but decided to take the chance anyway - a warhammer should get me to there alone in any case. Yes, I know a heavy flail would be better offensively, but I wanted to have a \"natural\" dwarf toon, so hammers and axes won out. Nonetheless, will be keeping my eyes peeled for extra fire protection (I've got the good old rings of power and elemental protection, but the Red Dragon armour now seems like a must keep). And my intention is to have acid damage applied by the drow smith anyway (that's my usual preference - other than sonic, which Rizolver doesn't do). Thanks for the ranged tip - I'm going with a light crossbow, so will start hoarding appropriately!<br/>\n<br/>\n Right, off to find some words of power...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks Empyre - happily, I'd actually taken your suggestions at levels 1 and 5 anyway!<br/>\n<br/>\n Alas, I'm still not getting what I'd hope for from the Pretty Good Character Creator - my fault, I'm sure - but have decided to plough on regardless. I will now be going through the OC and Aribeth's Redemption. Elsewhere, I've opened discussion on a planned build for that, but I've discarded it for a bastardized version of Tyr Templar's <strong>Dragonborn Ranger</strong> (Ranger 26/ Bard 4/ RDD 10). This is primarily because I remembered Empyre mentioning heatstroke and such in chapter 1 of SoF, so I wanted to circumvent that with an immunity to fire damage. My original design also had a problem with AC as a STR-based D-W Ranger, and that reduces with RDD (it ain't just about strength).<br/>\n<br/>\n When I say \"bastardized\", it's for three reasons. First, I didn't make the build swap until level 9 and really didn't want to start from scratch again, so had some re-jigging of skills to do - and I reckon I've managed full Spellcraft and 35 points in UMD while maintaining full Discipline, Spot and Tumble\u00a0 - and incorporating 9 points in Perform for song purposes - without huge pain, though it don't look pretty.<br/>\n<br/>\n Second, having already launched the character, I didn't give them the same starting stats, so no buffing for me.<br/>\n<br/>\n Third, I wanted to reach RDD 10 before level 27 (hopefully before SoF starts). I've done it by level 26, with one level of Bard and 4 of RDD pre-epic. Obviously this means a drop of 2 BAB, but it's more than compensated for by boosting STR to 38 (from 34). Please do check Tyr's proper build out - she put lots of effort into all she did and deserves much respect.<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, off into Luskan now at level 12, about to take my first Bard level...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I hope it's worth the trouble!<br/>\n<br/>\n I've arrived on the outskirts of Heliopolis, but be aware, when loading you will have to be fairly firm with the spirit that guards the planar gate to that city, or you'll just be wandering about aimlessly forever (you should be starting at a minimum of level 25, and, as Empyre has informed us elsewhere, be prepared to be a relatively good dude - sorry, Mick, have another absinthe). Please also be aware that you will (unless you've countered for it) be suffering heatstroke (fire damage), particularly if you're wearing a kettle, so some fire resistance or stripping is called for (again, I've taken a leaf from Empyre's book of knowledge and am intrisically fire-retardant as a level 10 RDD).<br/>\n<br/>\n Another thing to bear in mind is that you'll be stripped of any bagged/inventoried gear and gold if you enter at Hardcore difficulty, and you'll likely have spent some time accumulating what you want. To avoid this, drop the difficulty rating down a notch or two, which allows full inventory import, then up it again once you've arrived.
