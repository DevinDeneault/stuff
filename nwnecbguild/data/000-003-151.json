Even though Ranger is not required, the free Bane of Enemies would not be useful without favored enemies from Ranger (or maybe Harper Scout).<br/>\n<br/>\n Perhaps your Ranger 26 / Fighter 4 / CoT 10 idea would be pretty good after all. You might be better off making that a melee build, and for an archer, use Elf or a subrace of Elf with AA. There is nothing in the Ranger class that makes it a better at archery than melee. Archery without AA is generally weaker than melee, which is probably why AA was added in the first expansion pack (SoU).</div>",
