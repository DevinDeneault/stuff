When I played back in the day it seemed like every melee toon had dev crit and there were a lot of builds that were Monk(or rogue)/WM/Fighter, especially in modules that disallowed RDD though you'd mostly go Bard/RDD/?? for Dev critting everything in your way on other servers.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
