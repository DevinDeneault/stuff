      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hail, ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\n This build was a result of campgod's request for a level 40 version of a level 30 build in a\u00a0recent build-request thread. It's WAY\u00a0DIFFERENT from its counterparts, so it definitely deserves a thread. The idea is to make a\u00a0hero of the tribes. Someone who\u00a0would instil fear in the enemy, while being very efficient in combat.<br/>\n<br/>\n The 3 builds that use this class combo on the ECB\u00a0(strangely enough there are only 3 considering how GOOD the combo is) are quite similar to each other in a few aspects, but none is close to this one. Let's have a look at them, shall we?<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build228702.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dwarf o' the North</a> by DarkStar27909 is a well-conceived Devcritter, with\u00a0EDR 3, Terrifying Rage and Mighty Rage. Still, it only has 42 AB due to the EDR focus.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build256086.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Storm Knight of the Horned Lands</a> by grizzled_dwarflord is\u00a0strangely the one closest to this one, but he also goes for EDR in his build, and way more Rogue levels than this one.\u00a0His AB is also 42.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build217589.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Brash Adventurer-Hero</a> by Xylophone is an unoptimized toon with focus in RP that also goes for EDR 3 and Mighty Rage, but no Devcrit.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, these three builds have something in common with our guy, but also many differences. First of all, we don't go for EDR here because things will be running AWAY from us, not towards us, and with our incredible TR DC you bet they'll fail! Still, there are those fear-immune monsters and monsters who are higher level and will only be penalized, but still be able to attack us. Against those, we don't tank as efficiently, but we do very good damage, and we have DevCrit. None of the other builds\u00a0goes for more than 10 CoT levels, which we do, and none of them has enough CHA to use Divine Wrath. Our AB is 2 points higher and our TR DC reaches an incredible 65!. Our saves are significantly higher as well, since we have 22 CoT levels. We have Devcrit on a Scimitar, UMD to keen it, and a huge Fortitude save, so guess who's winning a battle of devcritters? WE are! With CON gear,\u00a0Rage increases\u00a0and buffs,\u00a0we can get our Fort up to 43, with our Divine Wrath, we can cap it once a day. This character is a beautiful high-save TRing, DevCritting, UMDing monster with the Taunt / Expertise combo, high AB, and a once-per-day GOD mode that lasts for up to 9 rounds with the correct gear.<br/>\n<br/>\n Ladies and Gents: The Champion of the Tribes!<br/>\n<br/>\n Barbarian(16), Champion of Torm(22), Rogue(2), Human<br/>\n<br/>\n Alignment: Any non-lawful, non-evil<br/>\n<br/>\n

I have on WoG and they do run around like crazy, but you have Barbarian Movement Speed Increase, so you run faster. However, someone said in one of the topics here that it's not how it works in default NWN, that they'd in fact be stunned instead. The point of Terrifying Rage is that it's pretty much irresistible, so anything that is lower level than you will run and therefore not hit you. It's good to not get hit, right? Those of higher level will suffer penalties when they attack you,<br/>\n<br/>\n Thundering Rage is shit, because it just enhances criticals. I'm aware that you think criticals are the best thing that could ever happen to a meleer, but they aren't: AB is!\u00a0That mindset will evolve as you delve deeper into the game. Adding a few points of damage when you crit is not as useful as adding a few points of damage when you hit and hitting more often. When you start facing non-pathetic AC monsters, you'll also start critting a lot less, which will make you revise the thought that WM is such a useful class with only 7 levels (been there, done that). Not just because sometimes they'll be imune to crits when they have 10 PM levels or are undead, construct or simply custom-made to be immune, but because you'll need to hit them on the second attack (the one which defines if a threat will in fact be a critical hit or not) to actually crit them. If you can't hit their ACs except on 20s, then they'll be effectively uncrittable for your toon. But I digress. Thundering rage is a wasted feat such as Overwhelming Critical. The only reason you take\u00a0the latter\u00a0is to get Devastating Critical, otherwise it'd be completely ignorable.<br/>\n<br/>\n Good luck with your friend. I'd take him through Aielund, man! That story is 10000000000 TIMES MORE INTERESTING than the OC's (A Metropolis like Neverwinter\u00a0creating an academy to recruit a level 1 hero??? LOL! WTF kind of story is that? It does evolve into something better, but that beginning is sufferable!). Aielund has suspense, drama, twists and turns, politics (which the OCs totally lack) and then turns into an epic at the appropriate moment. At level one you are (as you should be) a fetch-boy doing errands for people in exchange for a few coins. Trust me bro, you'll never want to go back once you try it!<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Bizarrely, this looks ideal. Except for the being human. And being a Dev Crit build (not viable in Aielund). Plus, I did tell Max a year ago that I'd try this one for size and I haven't yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n I've tied my brain in knots trying to modify it, to no avail, so I've come to the collective wisdom of the Guild for advice. By and large, all I've managed to agree on with myself is that the loss of the extra feat for being non-human is fine: just bin Great Cleave and do a bit of re-jigging of the pre-epic schedule; and I could swallow the SP losses by downsizing Spot and Lore. But I can't seem to properly get my head around the epic stuff and the starting stats, so any advice will be hugely welcome (barring advice that contains the phrase \"sod off\", or its equivalent).<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks, and sorry for being hopeless.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Many thanks, Hip.<br/>\n<br/>\n Hmm. I'd been toying with the idea of dropping CHA down to 12 (I was looking more at Terry Rage for attack boosts rather than Divine Wrath - in other words, using CoT for defensive purposes and Barb for offensive ones), boosting STR to 17 and DEX to 10 (oddly, 0 as a modifier will add 1 to AC), then taking an additional Grt STR and an Epic Sk Focus in either Intimidate or Taunt. What do you reckon?<br/>\n<br/>\n I like the Called Shot idea, and am not a great one for knockdowns, so might ditch Imp KD for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n Good call on delaying Rogue (would presumably be for 2 levels if I drop CHA to 12), I'd missed that. As for the second dump, given that Aielund finishes at cL36, I might have to sacrifice 1 Tumble AC boost and take Rogue 2 at L34, which would at least still enable a modified UMD of 35 (I think).<br/>\n<br/>\n Would I be correct in thinking (from your final sentence) that, regardless of your helpful comments, you're not over-enamoured with this one?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Would that were the case - it's the dearth of belts that poses the challenge! I've not played a Barb before, but \"charging blindly on\" seems to be their raison d'etre <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" />, and who am I to upset that motif? Admittedly, it'd be lovely to have them come for me one at a time, but to quote a bearded wonder, \"meh\".<br/>\n<br/>\n I will also admit that I fully expect to get deaded, or close to, quite a bit - as much as anything because I have never, ever used Expertise, even when I have it (I know, I know, I'm rubbish - don't use Expertise, don't use Knockdown, worried about using Rage because it falsifies CON and I'll have to remember to counter that post-crossness - what use am I?). Yes, that means a huge outlay in healing pots and kits, but you can't take it with you, right? I'm going for the get in close, quickly, and distract them by flattening their heads approach. Doddle.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'll let you know where to send the flowers and where the buffet's at...</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
