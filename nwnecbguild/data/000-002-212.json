      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hi all!<br/>\n After a bit more than two years of playing melee builds (and never tired of that, I am still continuing..), I'm thinking about playing as sorcerer or wizard. Based on my point of view and what I have understood, it seems a radical choice as I:<br/>\n \u00a0- Can't approach my enemies in a \"melee\" way (front attack);<br/>\n \u00a0- Have to learn when to use spell, and how to save them in order to not to rely too much on rests;<br/>\n (you are free to add items to this list <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" />).<br/>\n<br/>\n I would like to request to you any advice I might need in my \"new\" adventure, for example:<br/>\n \u00a0- how to build sorcerer and wizards (e.g. I have read that it's better, for wizards, to don't multiclass. For sorcerer, you can multiclass with paladin or blackguard, in order to gain a huge boost to saves): attributes, feats to consider (epic and non-epic), etc...<br/>\n \u00a0- how to play \"caster\" characters<br/>\n<br/>\n P.S.: searching in the nwn wiki, i found this page for spells: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Recommended_spells\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Recommended_spells</a><br/>\n<br/>\n Thank you all for your kind help!<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

There are few enough of us knuckle-runners left as it is - don't let those who can conjure cupcakes tempt you (it's all very Hansel and Gretel - or I'm doing too much Scotch)!<br/>\n<br/>\n Actually, to attempt some level of neutrality here, I think I made a mistake by trying a caster (albeit a divine, rather than arcane, one) too early. I wasn't ready for the change in gameplay. However, I do think that my recent adventures with a shootist (Hip's Wulgar: you can read about his activities in the Aeilund thread if you've a mind to), and indeed an assassin (Mick Dagger's Kama Shinobi - ditto her adventures) have better prepared me for the \"wait a moment\" mentality necessary. Now, I probably don't need to say any of this, but I wouldn't want your first forray into the dark arts to disappoint you, so I'm merely raising a \"careful does it\" flag, if you don't mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n And yet, as one of the old great and good might have said, I would still encourage you to ~ HIT THINGS WITH REAL WEAPONS - ON! ~ <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If you don't mind sacrificing overall DC, you can easily build an Epic Dodge wiz/rog with lots of those wiz pre-epic bonus feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot depends on the environment.\u00a0 If crafting is encouraged, that takes care of the long dungeon crawls because you'll use your scrolls and wands for pedestrian challenges and save the high-caster versions for bosses and their minions.\u00a0 Scrolls/wands/rods have the advantage of not triggering AoOs while within melee range.<br/>\n<br/>\nI stack traps thick when I know a horde is nearby and I <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">know</span> they are there and how bunched up because I drop an Invis pot on my pixie, posess it,\u00a0 have it cast ImpInvis on my statue and perform the recon.\u00a0 I usually sacrifice the pixie to register some preemptive damage before the formal attack (pixie is the only familiar that holds a weapon that can be buffed with GMW &amp; Flame Weapon).\u00a0 You'd be surprised how long that twinkling moth form lasts against tough foes.\u00a0 And if they immediately chase it around before it attacks, I know they can see through Invisibility... useful info for the pre-buff slot plan.\u00a0 <br/>\n<br/>\nThen there is the Skel Chief-wading-into-a-mob-while-your-mage-spams-empowered-NEB-one-after-the-other exploit.\u00a0 Worthless strat against undead, though.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan't help you with sorc, however.\u00a0 Tried to force-fit myself into playing an exalted sorc a few times but always seemed too limited by the known list.\u00a0 It's IGMS or bust IMO else go wiz.\u00a0 I go wiz.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's one to think about:\u00a0 Dwarven LE Wiz25/Asn9/DwD6.\u00a0 Haven't tried it yet but seems like a fun concept a first glance.\u00a0 It came to me in a dream. <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It should be automatic and one of the first aspects of the game you perfect.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That's why I don't go to the theatre any more.)<br/>\n<br/>\n More pertinently, there's no reason at all you have to play a Bard as a support character - indeed, if you just want the benefits of the song, my first ever build request resulted in an elven Fighter/Bard/RDD. If I remember correctly, it was Fighter 16, Bard 14, RDD 10 and was an awesome dual-wielder with handaxes. Had bugger all spells, but the song was great, and certainly didn't require big nasty boys or girls to front him.<br/>\n<br/>\n Bard is an exceptionally versatile class - check Hip's database of finalized builds (recently updated and available from the Rules and Tools sub-forum here) and you'll get ones who only use their song right through to those whose Charisma would make Nelson Mandela look like an orc with acne.<br/>\n<br/>\n Stay true to hitting things!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hey Aquarius!<br/>\n<br/>\n I have a few tips myself to add and I hope that they'll be useful. Firstly, I'd check our forums under level 40 section for ideas of builds that you may want to play. I could recommend many builds, but the bad thing is we don't have a search engine for these new builds, so you'd have to find them anyway. Skim through our forums and take a look at some of our builds.<br/>\n<br/>\n There are basically 2 types of casters: dedicated casters and spellswords. With arcane classes, you can't do both. With Cleric you can cheat, but that's for another topic. Anyway, I have a Wizard 26 / Bard 4 / RDD 10 build (I believe it's called the Draconic Arcanist), which is a good example of a good spellsword. If you want a spellsword with Sorcerer, I'd recommend Mick's Spellsword of Bahamut (but I'd tweak in the divine feats lol). Spellbook management and spell choices are VERY DIFFERENT if you're playing spellswords than if you're playing a dedicated caster. For spellswords, you're looking to use no-save spells and generally avoid casting spells that require a save. You also need to worry about penetration (basically beating Spell Resistance), so you'll need to know your enemies to figure out which ones have SR that could be a problem and use Greater Spell Breach or even Mordenkainen's Disjunction so your spells will affect them.<br/>\n<br/>\n As for Dedicated casters, you will max out your casting stats and take many levels in your caster class to be able to penetrate spell resistance, and your spells will be your main bread and butter. That means you'll suck at melee combat (and ranged), so you'll need to rely on summons to protect your wimpy mage while you rain destruction upon your foes. You will also choose a school of magic to focus on, the two main ones being Evocation and Necromancy. A good example of a dedicated caster is my Boddyknock Gincke build, which is a concept build, but is as versatile and as deadly as a dedicated caster can be. He also takes advantage of Hip's well-pointed-out Rogue synergy to be able to set traps and do a lot of funky things. Playing a dedicated caster is also exponentially harder than playing a spellsword, as you'll need to know your enemies' weak save to figure out the best spell to cast in that situation. Typically, it's FORT for mages and sneakers and WILL for meleers and sneakers too. Monks don't have a weak save. You'll also need to be mindful of which foes can be a problem. Typically, mages make excellent boss killers, but because they run on limited supplies (spells per day) they tend to struggle against hordes of minions and long restless periods. Henchmen in campaigns make our life much easier, but in PWs, if you're not in a party, summons will be the way to go, although they are very sub-par in NWN.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, I hope this advice helps you get started, Feel free to ask me any questions that may arise.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take care!<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I never left, I was just having a two-year Siesta, which is nothing in dragon years LOL.<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Hip<br/>\n Good to see you're still up here, man! And I've also returned to WoG, and I see you're still playing there. Great stuff! We should play together one day. Carnival in Brazil is basically a dead season in terms of work, so from today until next Thursday, I'll be free.<br/>\n<br/>\n About the search engine, I remember you and BC were working on it. Good to see the result. I am confused about something, though (and I didn't read the tutorial so if it's there I apologized in advance). The APR column refers to attacks per round, correct? My Holy Weapon Master with Cheese is listed as having 5 APR, when she in fact has 4 (we don't assume perma-haste, do we?). Similarly, my Magical Master build, which has 8 APR (10 if you go for the TWF feats), and I imagine the same goes for the others, although I just skimmed through this before posting this. And one more thing: Boy, Val has a TON of builds! I thought I was the most prolific builder in the guild, but\u00a0apparently I was wrong LOL!<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Aquarius<br/>\n I felt EXACTLY the same way when I first joined in 2006 (or was it 2003? I can't remember, but it was a LONG time ago). I made the effort of writing a couple of \"full guides\" for beginners, so that this gap in knowledge of the game can be reduced more quickly (or less slowly to be more truthful). Please refer to the Game Guides section of this guild and look up \"A Complete Guide to the Basics of Character Building\", which talks about what you should take under consideration when building a toon (according to our standards LOL) and what you can safely disregard. Then after reading that, you can go to \"Playing Better\", which talks about things that you should know to USE your builds better in-game. There's a lot of important info in both guides that'll set you in the right track. Then there are many specific guides about specific classes, which can help you get to know how to play each class better. I wrote guides for Clerics, Druids and Paladins, Mick wrote a guide to Arcane Archers and Assassins, and Hip graced us with many skill-and-feat specific guides. There's a lot of knowledge in our tomes. You'll be amazed at how much useful stuff you can find out here. I would start with the two guides that I told you about because they're more general and generic, then move on to the class ones, then finally the advanced mechanics ones. IMO that's the order that makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n Happy that our home is still alive! See you guys soon! Take it EZ!

And I've also returned to WoG, and I see you're still playing there. Great stuff! We should play together one day. Carnival in Brazil is basically a dead season in terms of work, so from today until next Thursday, I'll be free.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n About the search engine, I remember you and BC were working on it. Good to see the result. I am confused about something, though (and I didn't read the tutorial so if it's there I apologized in advance). The APR column refers to attacks per round, correct? My Holy Weapon Master with Cheese is listed as having 5 APR, when she in fact has 4 (we don't assume perma-haste, do we?). Similarly, my Magical Master build, which has 8 APR (10 if you go for the TWF feats), and I imagine the same goes for the others, although I just skimmed through this before posting this. And one more thing: Boy, Val has a TON of builds! I thought I was the most prolific builder in the guild, but\u00a0apparently I was wrong LOL!<br/>\n \u00a0</div></blockquote>\n That's what happens when someone counts the beans.\u00a0 No stones are left unturned and can be inspected under a microscope.<br/>\n<br/>\n As to your questions...\u00a0 yup, the Holy Weapon Master w/Cheese should be 4 APR and it's been noted for the next revision. Thanks. The 5 APR simply means the build uses the monk progression so the Magical Master is correct.\u00a0 I didn't get into figuring DW potential.\u00a0 Too much extra calculating per build.\u00a0 Transcribing what's there now was tedious enough so sorry for the confusion.\u00a0 The APR is based solely on BAB with the one exception being monk attack.<br/>\n<br/>\n Just to quickly reveal the genesis...<br/>\n<br/>\n BC and I were planning on building an on-line SQL database that included a front end.\u00a0 That would have been an interactive window where submitters would populate the fields themselves and spare the efforts of one-by-one transcriptions. Well, BC bailed for personal reasons so I decided to make something available on my own while the game still has new players coming on board.\u00a0 The result is the spreadsheet you see on the NWVault.\u00a0 Not perfect, but better than nothing and with far more functionality than the class/author/race query the old Search Engine was able to screen.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Once you've played around with it a bit, you may be amazed beyond just noting the greatest number of contributions from a single author.\u00a0 Blame the rest of the errors on Stagmeister.\u00a0 Nah! Seriously... without his assistance, the data wouldn't be anywhere near as accurate as what it is.\u00a0 IIRC I gave him a complimentary cookie but if not, he will surely remind me of the oversight.<br/>\n<br/>\n As far as WoG goes... I'm still waiting for Rhaine to load the server onto a better machine.\u00a0 It seems every time I've stopped in to wander around, either the server is down or empty.\u00a0 Just FYI, I still have the toon we started for a dedicated party (it may even have been for Daelen AFAIK), waiting in limbo, though I'm no longer sure of which one.\u00a0 Does Nioche strike a bell with you?\u00a0 My memory seems worthless to me these days.<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyhoo... apologies to Aquarius for pseudo-hijacking the thread.\u00a0 Sometimes these sideways diversions are unavoidable! <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /></div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">Hey Hip.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm still confused about the APR thing. The Holy Weapon Master with Cheese wields a Longsword, which effectively nullifies the attack progression from Monk, so it is indeed 4. As for the number 5 being used to signify Monk attack progression, I don't understand. Monks get 1 attack per 3 points in BAB, so techincally, a \"full BAB\" Monk would have 6 APR, 7 with FoB, 8 with FoB and Hasted. So even assuming that the Holy WM would use Monk attack progression, it'd be 6 APR, not 5. Basically, Monks gain an extra attack at BAB 3,6,9,12,15,18. I can imagine how tedious it must've been, but I figure you'll want to correct that eventually, when you muster up the patience for this. I felt a bit impatient just looking at the thing, can't imagine how much work went into compiling all that data.<br/>\n<br/>\n BC and I have been playing together again lately. You should join us! We'll probably play tonight.\u00a0I'm sure he'll be happy to see what you've done with the spreadsheet. Maybe he'll even feel motivated to resume your project :D. However, as far as this being a boon to new players, I don't know how many new players would be knowledgeable enough about the game to even take advantage of so much detail. You have to be aware of things to actively search for them, but kudos for the effort to both you and Stagmeister!<br/>\n<br/>\n As for the toon, yes, it was Nioche. Unfortunately, since I haven't seen you online in ages, I've been adventuring with Daelan and he's now level 18. But, worry not. I have many toons that can be a better aid to Nioche around level 11. In fact, there are still SO MANY builds of mine that I haven't played on WoG, even after all these years. I've been planning to make a Draconic Arcanist and a few more Baldur's Gate characters.<br/>\n<br/>\n You know, what keeps me playing this game even after all these years are the builds. I just love my characters so much, their unique talents and different playstyles that associate with each of them! It's mind-boggling how a game can be so wonderfully complexe and diverse to keep a hyperactive player such as myself interested even after all these years.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>Good to see you're back from your siesta, Max! :) Mick </div></blockquote>\n\n Thanks, brother! Glad to be back!<br/>\n<br/>\n @ Aquarius<br/>\n<br/>\n Sorry for hijacking the thread too. It's what happens when old friends reunite :D<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers, everyone!</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I can't remember, but it was a LONG time ago). I made the effort of writing a couple of \"full guides\" for beginners, so that this gap in knowledge of the game can be reduced more quickly (or less slowly to be more truthful). Please refer to the Game Guides section of this guild and look up \"A Complete Guide to the Basics of Character Building\", which talks about what you should take under consideration when building a toon (according to our standards LOL) and what you can safely disregard. Then after reading that, you can go to \"Playing Better\", which talks about things that you should know to USE your builds better in-game. There's a lot of important info in both guides that'll set you in the right track. Then there are many specific guides about specific classes, which can help you get to know how to play each class better. I wrote guides for Clerics, Druids and Paladins, Mick wrote a guide to Arcane Archers and Assassins, and Hip graced us with many skill-and-feat specific guides. There's a lot of knowledge in our tomes. You'll be amazed at how much useful stuff you can find out here. I would start with the two guides that I told you about because they're more general and generic, then move on to the class ones, then finally the advanced mechanics ones. IMO that's the order that makes sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n Happy that our home is still alive! See you guys soon! Take it EZ!

I have printed them and began to read them...I plant to slowly study them, in order to (try to) master their contents....for now, <strong>many many thank you</strong> all for writing and posting these guides!<br/>\n<br/>\n I would like to ask you: if I have to build a spellsword but with minor levels, would it be feasible to build a lv 20/30 character?

The question is not whether you CAN build a Spellsword for level 20 / 30 (the answer is yes, you can), but why would you want to? What makes spellswords poweful is high level arcane spells with a moderate melee presence. They essentially address the specific situations where mages are kind of weak by giving up some spellcasting ability in exchange for melee prowess. However, many of the signature best spells in the arcane arsenal are at their disposal: Time Stop, Mordenkainen's Disjunction, IGMS, Greater Spell Mantle, Premonition, damage shields, Etc... so they can fight in melee against minions (hordes of weaklings) and cast against the tough enemies or get themselves beat up and kill them via damage shields.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n The whole point of making a spellsword is to take advantage of that aspect. That being said, there may be concepts where you could get an effective toon with fewer caster levels, but I would have to have more specific information to point you in the right direction. Just as an example, I have rebuilt all the OC henchmen just for fun, and my build for Nathyrra is a spellsword with only 10 Wizard levels. And she's good. Not great, good. Being a concept build, she's a bit on the weak side for a powerbuild, but I believe she's as strong as she can be within her concept. Look her build up in the spreadsheet Hip mentioned above.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
