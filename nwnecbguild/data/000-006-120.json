Wyrmling for True seeing and Gargoyle for low level tanking<br/>\nDruid feats add +2 to AB and +4 to stealth in wilderness areas. The spells One with the land and Camouflage add to stealth. Bull's strength buff the main attack stat, Ultravision complements the Assassin's Darkness spell.<br/>\n<br/>\nCons:<br/>\nA bit low on hitpoints<br/>\nNo evasion<br/>\nCannot set traps in Kobold shape<br/>\nHas 3 attacks per round with only 1 attack in the first flurry. A haste item will improve that and give 4 attacks with 2 in the first flurry. And HIPS let you repeat it all!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI have had great fun playing this little killer.

It compensates some for small size, but small creatures are always at a disadvantage when using the KD feats.<br/>\nI play my builds in different modules, most of them end long before lvl 40. My minimum is to level my builds up to lvl 40 in a trainer, just to check that the build is possible and legal. The CBC is awonderful tool, but I don't trust it 100%, there have been some bugs. So I always test build my characters to se that they are legal.<br/>\nThis build I have played to lvl 40 in the Endless Nights module. You level up fast and can test playability at different levels without spending years in the process. The module has a strange mix between low magic items in the shops on one hand, and drops from bosses and chests on the other, that scale with character level to something between +6 and +9 and the occasional high magic item, depending on how \"lucky\" you are. But it is almost impossible to plan on a given set of equipment. In general you end up with something in the middle; something good and something bad. The average is probably what you will call mid magic. If I happen to get an item with too high properties, I just drop it, because it will ruin the test and spoil the challenge. I don't pick up henchmen.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Nice concept of a build. It's a shame polymorphs can't use rogue skills or spells or you'll bet I'll be making so many shifter builds of all kind. Though, I would've traded some assassin levels for more shifter levels for something like Druid6/Shifter17/Assassin17 to get the epic kobold shape. This way, you'll get 2d6 less sneak attack damage but you'll get 2d4+3 more base damage, an additionnal 2d6 on critical strike, more THP and Dex, +6 weapon to pierce stronger damage reductions, and improved evasion. However, this may also imply to rework feats. I'm still new to the game mechanics so tell me if they're things that wouldn't work with my idea for future builds.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thank you francois!<br/>\nYou can build with the epic Kobold shape and get a fine build. The epic shape gives a lot of improvements over the base one. Among other things, you get a +6 weapon and higher dexterity, and you get bonus damage from added SA damage on the \"creature skin\" and bonus weapon damage. There are some shifter assassin builds in the old archive that use the epic shape.<br/>\nSo why did I choose the base type with this build?<br/>\nWith the lower number of assassin levels you have to take with the epic shape, the Death attack DC becomes too low to compete with the fort saves of many lvl 40 creatures. You can compensate for that by building up a high intelligence, but then you will not get high enough strength for Dev Crit and you will lose damage and even some AB.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The main downsides are that both the Death Attack die and DC are lower for the epic version.

If you're fighting something with high detect and See Invisibility or True Seeing you won't be able to generate sneak attacks by using HiPS or Invisibility, KD can help in that situation.\u00a0Assuming that mobs on your server have decent AI, HiPS spamming and Invisibility alone will only give you sneak attacks on your first flurry. With KD you can get sneak attacks on two flurries per round, and if you combine HiPS and KD you can generate a sneak attack with every attack you make (provided that HiPS and KD work on your opponent).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You can have +3 natural AC from barkskin and + 2-5 str from bull's. Helmet, shield and armor merge, but AC doesn't stack normally when shifted and only the item with the best AC will affect the total AC.<br/>\nGo with the best of these two tactics as long as possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe <em>greater wildshape I</em> gives several different wyrmlings. They are great for scouting with TS, but too weak for combat. They override str and your natural str is better. They are great for resisting elemental damage though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>Greater wildshape II</em> </strong>gives the minotaur, the harpy and the gargoyle. The Minotaur is strong, but your character is stronger and the AC of the minotaur is not good enough with your low dex. The harpy has a special attack and that is that.<br/>\nThe Gargoyle is the best option here. it merges everything, except weapon and gloves (shifters in general never merge gloves). It does not override strength and that is a good thing since your strength is high. It overrides your weak dex and con to 18 for each of them. The base AC is 22 before you add spells and items. It has DR 15/+1 so it absorbs a lot of (most of) the damage from non magical weapons. And that also means that its creature attack is a +1 attack vs DR.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Greater wildshape III</em>\u00a0 has the basilisk, the manticore and the drider. The basilisk and manticore have their special attacks that maybe can solve special situations. The drider is a warrior with str 16, dex 16, con 15 and 20 AC. I think the Gargoyle is better most of the time, if not all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Humanoid shape</strong> is where you get your kobold commando shape and the fun starts.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Weapon properties stack with armor/item properties for shapes that merge weapons, so it's a choice between damage and +6 STR/CON. Armor/item properties merge onto the creature skin and so don't stack properly, but the creature skin and weapon (for shapes that have weapons) are separate and so those properties do stack properly.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, say you have +6 STR/DEX/CON on your armor, +6 DEX on your shield, and +6 STR/CON on your morningstar. When you shift you will have +12STR/CON and +6 DEX, since the STR/CON increase from the armor stacks with the STR/CON increase from the weapon, but the DEX increase from the armor does not stack with the DEX increase from the shield.<br/>\n<br/>\nAB/EB bonuses will not stack with the shifted +6 EB short sword. Say you have +5 EB on your weapon, when you shift the short sword will have both +5 EB and +6 EB, but since only the highest EB matters the short sword stays as +6 EB. If you had a +7 EB weapon then the shifted weapon would have both +6 EB and +7 EB and thus would be a +7 EB weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I would just carry both weapons and switch as needed, encumbrance won't be an issue with this build. One of the few positives of item merging is that you can mix and match items at will. Only the properties matter, not the base item.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the reason you only had electrical damage when shifted at level 25 is because only Epic Kobold Commando has bonus acid damage on their short sword. Pre-epic Kobold Commando only has +3 EB and On Hit: Poison.

O_o).\u00a0 So one has to shift out, into either a form or normal, equip a ranged weapon/ability/spell and attract, switch back to melee weapon and shield (if it was not a sling, etc) and shift back to kobold (or whatever).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe build's offense is pretty good - it's not great, but it is not poor.\u00a0 Damage output can be remarkably high under the right circumstances, and against certain foes, it becomes a little strained (like anything with vanilla True Seeing, immunity to Sneaks and Crits, etc).\u00a0 Still, it performs well against DR type foes - I like that part of the build very much.\u00a0 There is nothing like slinking from the shadows and really putting a brutal beatdown on an otherwise terrifying foe!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was pleasantly surprised on how well the shortsword performs in this build.\u00a0 With all things considered, a crit range from 15~20 is really good, the AB is high enough (~50 fully buffed), so crits and sneaks really do a lot of damage per hit.\u00a0 For those that have skyhigh Fort saves, the Overwhelming Crit gives crits upwards of 100+ damage per hit, which really is fantastic to see.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll continue the build to 40, just to see if it gets any better - but all things considered at this point, I would definitely say that it is a good, solid build that Mick has given us here.\u00a0 Only that little dip pre-epic remains a blemish on an otherwise great build.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, Mick, for letting us have this build.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Any other character can just equip the items and things stack normally. With shifters the stacking of item properties is limited. That makes you depend on the properties of the different creature skins. And once they cannot compete with the stacking properties on a \"normal\" character type you are in trouble. Shifters are therefore definitely best in low magic environments, but they can also work in medium magic environments, depending on how things are balanced.<br/>\nSome of the shifter forms are more viable as a focus for a given build. Kobold commando is one of them. You also have builds with focus on the Risen lord, Rakshasa and Dragon forms. Dragon is as far as I know the most popular and most often taken with Druid alone without Shifter.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat makes the Kobold Comando interesting in my opinion is that you get a very good stealth character that even has HIPS and that strength is not overwritten so you can build up both AB, damage and a high Dev crit DC when you focus on strength.<em> You get some SA for free with the creature properties and you can pile up more if you take Assassin or BG as third class. </em><br/>\n<em>Bevare that Kobold commando SA and Rogue SA do not stack.</em><br/>\nWith this build I chose Assassin and took enough Assassin levels to get a high DA DC. Assassin also provides a long lasting Improved invisibility that becomes hard to dispel.<br/>\nWith NWN EE, Assassin is not as good as it used to be in terms of DA paralyzation, but the DA damage is still there. With this build you get a double first attack if you can haste yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to focus on the DA DC, it is even possible to build with a focus on intelligence. If you max out both intelligence and assassin levels, the DC becomes extremely high.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Edit: Stacking SA</em><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I'm not planning on making a full shifter guide, but the best advice I can give to any potential shifter builder is: \"If you can avoid building a shifter you probably shouldn't build a shifter.\"<br/>\nI say this as somebody who has played a dedicated manticore build, a DC assassin dire bear, and even a smiting badger. Although shifters can be a lot of fun they are almost always terrible from a powerbuilding perspective. Some shapes offer advantages that can't be gained with non-shifter builds but you sacrifice a lot in order to focus on those shapes. Custom item merging helps mitigate some of these problems but even then you are still limited to only feats and potions while shifted.<br/>\nAs for decent shapes to focus in, from best to worst I'd probably say: Dragon, Rakshasa (1.69),\u00a0Epic Kobold Commando, Risen Lord, Kobold Commando, and Stone Golem.<br/>\nThere are other shapes that can be useful but in my opinion are not good enough to be the focus of a decent build in vanilla NWN: Epic Drow Warrior, Vampire, Rakshasa (EE), Elemental Shape, Epic Drider, Epic Manticore, Epic Gargoyle, Mindflayer, and Wyrmling.<br/>\n<br/>\nRog kobold is a bad idea unless you really want that +6 EB weapon, just make a Rog/Figh/SD and enjoy your 4 APR and ability to use items. Rogue Sneak Attack doesn't stack with kobold Sneak Attack, both BG Sneak Attack and Death Attack do. Epic Kobold Commando gets Improved Evasion for free, and the best Rog feat (Epic Dodge) requires 25 DEX that is wasted when shifted. You can make a STR Rog kobold with Crippling Strike, but again I'd just suggest making a STR Rog/Figh/SD instead.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only BG Kobold Commando build I like is a Dru5/Shif7/BG28 smiter but I would hesitate to call it a good build. Especially since Smite Good is less useful than Smite Evil in most PvM environments. None of the three classes have MS as a class skill, so even if you cross-class it and take ESF: MS at level 39 your stealth won't be good enough to HiPS against any competent listeners.<br/>\n<br/>\nPoison stacks while shifted and will last until you deshift. I did some testing with Darkfire and Deadly Giant Bee Venom. Darkfire worked normally, triggering on every hit. Both poison effects worked, although after hitting 31 times the kobold poison triggered 4 times and the DGBV triggered 5 times. There were two attacks where both poison effects triggered for the same attack, so they definitely stack together properly.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That would explain why you keep your druid spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you shift/deshift the game removes and then reapplies all of your bonuses from items, as if you unequipped and then reequipped your gear. This means you temporarily lose WIS/INT/CHA or any items with the Bonus Spell Slot property, so when you shift/deshift you will lose spell slots. Any bonuses from spells, such as Owl's Insight, continue to apply during the shifting process and so you don't lose any of those slots. So you would still need to reslot after shifting even if you geared to get +12 INT from your armor, helmet, and shield slots.\u00a0Unless your server changes how item merging works there is no way to fix this problem.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThis also applies to any CON bonuses, so be very careful when shifting/deshifting with low HP.

When you shift you no longer automatically lose all spell slots granted by WIS/INT/CHA bonuses from items. I did experience the same behaviour with spell slots but I haven't been able to duplicate it since so I'll need to do more testing. After the testing I've already done I'm certain that having the Bonus Spell Slot property is actually worse for shifters than not having it.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll focus on Druid/WIS and Dragon Shape (merges Armor, Helmet, Shield), but this applies to Cler/WIS and Wiz/INT too. I assume that it also applies to Pal/WIS and Rang/WIS but I haven't bothered to test it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSay you have +12 WIS on your helmet. When you shift you have +12 WIS, and you keep all bonus spell slots granted by this +12 WIS when you deshift.<br/>\n<br/>\nSay you have +6 WIS on your helmet and +6 WIS on your shield. When you shift you will have +6 WIS, and you keep all bonus spell slots granted by this +6 WIS when you deshift. Any spell slots granted by the additional +6 WIS you have when unshifted will be greyed out as if already cast.<br/>\n<br/>\nSay you have +12 WIS on your boots (which don't merge). When you shift you won't have any bonus WIS, and all spell slots granted by the +12 WIS will be greyed out when you deshift.<br/>\n<br/>\nSay you have +12 WIS on your helmet and a shield with the Bonus Spell Slot: Druid Level 9 property. When you shift you will have +12 WIS, and you keep all of the bonus spell slots granted by this +12 WIS when you deshift for spell levels 1-8. On level 9 the bonus spell slots granted by both the +12 WIS and Bonus Spell Slot property will be emptied (rather than greyed out).<br/>\n<br/>\nSay you have +12 WIS on your helmet and boots (which don't merge) with\u00a0the Bonus Spell Slot: Druid Level 9 property. When you shift you will have +12 WIS, and you keep all of the bonus spell slots granted by this +12 WIS when you deshift for spell levels 1-8. On level 9 the bonus spell slots granted by both the +12 WIS and Bonus Spell Slot property will be greyed out.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor polymorph forms, when you deshift any bonus slots granted by ability increases or Bonus Spell Slot properties will be greyed out but will not be emptied.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ability increases work the same way for Sorc/CHA but the bonus slots work differently. I assume that this also applies to Bard/CHA but I haven't bothered to test it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSay you have the Bonus Spell Slot: Sorcerer Level 9 property on x items that merge and on y items that don't merge. When you shift you will lose x+y level 9 Sorc spells and when you deshift you will lose another x level 9 Sorc spells. This is in addition to any spells lost from decreased CHA.\u00a0You only lose spells from the CHA decrease once, but you lose spells from the Bonus Spell Slot property every time you shift/deshift. It's possible to lose every spell on a given level without casting any spells just by shifting and deshifting.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor polymorph forms, when you deshift any bonus slots granted by CHA increases are lost. If you have z items with the Bonus Spell Slot: Level 9 property then you will lose z level 9 Sorc spells when you shift. You only lose spells from the CHA decrease once, but you lose spells from the Bonus Spell Slot property every time you shift into a polymorph form.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

O_o).\u00a0 So one has to shift out, into either a form or normal, equip a ranged weapon/ability/spell and attract, switch back to melee weapon and shield (if it was not a sling, etc) and shift back to kobold (or whatever).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe build's offense is pretty good - it's not great, but it is not poor.\u00a0 Damage output can be remarkably high under the right circumstances, and against certain foes, it becomes a little strained (like anything with vanilla True Seeing, immunity to Sneaks and Crits, etc).\u00a0 Still, it performs well against DR type foes - I like that part of the build very much.\u00a0 There is nothing like slinking from the shadows and really putting a brutal beatdown on an otherwise terrifying foe!<br/>\n<br/>\nI was pleasantly surprised on how well the shortsword performs in this build.\u00a0 With all things considered, a crit range from 15~20 is really good, the AB is high enough (~50 fully buffed), so crits and sneaks really do a lot of damage per hit.\u00a0 For those that have skyhigh Fort saves, the Overwhelming Crit gives crits upwards of 100+ damage per hit, which really is fantastic to see.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll continue the build to 40, just to see if it gets any better - but all things considered at this point, I would definitely say that it is a good, solid build that Mick has given us here.\u00a0 Only that little dip pre-epic remains a blemish on an otherwise great build.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks, Mick, for letting us have this build.</div></blockquote>\nHey Web!!!<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst and foremost, congrats on successfully playing a build that isn't intended to be played on a server like WoG. Like Mick said, if magic items grant you a better boon than the Kobold Commando sword, then the build will suck, comparatively. I presume that in a server where a +3 weapon with 1d6 of elemental damage and 1 extra property is the cream of the crop, this build would thrive. However, I have to say that even though I understand why Mick chose to make this build 6/7/27 for that extra 1 DA DC and 1d6 damage, I prefer the split used in Death Says Yip (coupled with a little shuffling of stats for at least 14 WIS) of 7/7/26. What that does for you in Vanilla NWN is it allows ALL your unarmed froms to pierce DR as though they were wielding a +5 weapon due to the Stoneskin spell. That works for Bear Wildshape, Gargoyle, Wyrmling, etc... This could be instrumental in surviving that PITA period between 15-20.<br/>\n<br/>\n@Mick<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like the concept of this build, but I don't think I'd have fun trying it, as IMO you lose WAY TOO MUCH in a dedicated build like this when you go Shifter without Monk levels. Defensively, as much as you try, you'll be very easy to hit and there's nothing you can do about that except HiPS. Kudos for extracting the most juice out of the idea, though! As always, Mick Dagger's Assassin are like Wolverine: \"I'm the best at what I do\". LOL<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Quick question. Does Taunt work when shifted?<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
