You see I play on Arelith lv 30 cap, and um I wanted to make a Half elf healing cleric (you know strong on the healing side/buffing side) mainly for fun, and RP purposes, if possible I'd still like to be able to PvM and PvP to some extent mainly PvM, as for PvP mostly any help where I wouldn't get crushed in a heart beat</div>"

      "content": "<div>I have 2 ideas: Cleric 26 / Monk 4 or Cleric 24 / Monk 3 / Rogue 3. Adding Monk lets you add your Wisdom bonus to your AC. The first option would be easier to roleplay, with only 2 classes, and it would give you a second Cleric bonus feat. The second option gives you Uncanny Dodge, which protects your Dexterity AC, and those nifty Rogue skills (but not until really late). One domain would of course be Healing. Let's let the other experts weigh in on what the other domain should be.</div>",

The biggest problem here is not getting Wisdom bonus for a long time. But, on the other hand, you get 15 BAB instead of 14 pre-epic.<br/>\n<br/>\n Other domain should be Travel for Haste. Hasted, you can cast / heal faster.<br/>\n<br/>\n Does anyone want to build it or should I?

Zen Archery will give you good ranged AB because you're going for Wisdom (because you want a Healer, not a Battle Cleric). If you want to melee, then you would be a Battle Cleric, and either have to go for STR or DEX / just enough WIS to cast spells. You will be a healer (which is basically a CASTER toon who memorizes Heals, Stilled Heals, Mass Heals, Stilled Mass Heals, etc). This is your specialty. You can buff up with Divine Favors (all your level 1 spells should be Divine Favors and all your Level 2 spells should be Extended Divine Favors). That will allow you to conserve your spells for tougher fights. You can snipe the weak mobs and save your spells for tougher enemies. You should avoid meleeing at all costs and the best way to do that is to take Called Shot feat along with Zen Archery.

Silent Spell it is! I'll edit it right now. It's funny that with my Cleric experience I had no idea that Heal was a level 5 spell for the Healing domain, because there are so many MUCH better domains to have I don't think I've EVER chosen it, not to mention that if you read my guide you know all level 5 spells should be..... EXTENDED DIVINE POWERS!<br/>\n<br/>\n Jaquerez, I hope you like your healer, but you should read my Cleric guide: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/515461/An-Insight-into-the-Cleric-Class#.VQ_Qq-Z0zmQ\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">An Insight into the Cleric Class</a><br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div>\n</div></blockquote>\n<div align=\"left\">So, replace still spell, with Silent spell got it. ...But, I assume Silent is better since I probably won't be wearing armor. So, does that mean I could heal an ally, if they were surrounded by the Silence spell (you know, that one that seems to make an AOE silence zone.</div></div>"

Among the data that was compromised were the passwords of every player's forum account.<br/>\n<br/>\n If you played on Arelith and you have the same or similar forum passwords, it is recommended you change them IMMEDIATELY.<br/>\n<br/>\n If you have any information on the hacker or other comprimised security, please bring it to the attention of myself or another member of the DM team.
