      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hail, Mighty ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\nI had recently posted this exact build as a concept build for Edwin Odesseiron from Baldur's Gate. Then, in the previous topic, WebShaman posted his views on what Edwin would be like, and I came to agree with him about Edwin's story and how this build didn't suit his trajectory. He was indeed a Conjurer, and left the Red Wizards of Thay, so likely wouldn't pursue Necromancy. Then I remembered that early in Baldur's Gate 1, just outside Candlekeep, you meet a sketchy duo called Xzar and Montaron, and the former is indeed a CE Necromancer. Unfortunately, I never actually took them with me as companions, so I don't know exactly what they were like in the game, but I had worked really hard on optimizing this build, taken into account multiple factors to make the most of it, so I didn't want it to go to waste. Then\u00a0I decided to pass this build on to Xzar and get Edwin a brand new rework, which is already in the works. Thank you, WebShaman, for sharing your thoughts with me! I'm happy with the end result!<br/>\n<br/>\nSince the theme of this build is Necromancy, I made many decisions that add flavor, but aren't necessarily powergaming-oriented, like choosing Necromancy as a specialized school, and taking Mummy Dust as an Epic Spell. These are perfectly droppable if you want to give this guy a go. Because you specialize in Necromancy, Divination spells are off limits for you. For the most part, that's not a big deal, but there are 2 spells that you'll really miss: True Seeing and Premonition. However, there is an item called Gem of Seeing, which I believe you can still use regardless, because it's not a spell. Premonition, on the other hand, you can't obtain without cheesing it out really hard (you can have a friend cast it on multiple Sequencer Robes and carry them around if you really can't survive without it). I, however, was able to play this guy all the way to level 37 solo on WoG without that spell, so it is doable, for sure. Use a DR Belt (Greater Slashing, Greater Piercing, or Greater Brawler's Belt) and Greater Stoneskin, alongside a Ring or Amulet of Fire Resistance and a bit of Regeneration (Ring of Power, if it's available) should suffice. Just carry around a few stacks of Greater Stoneskin scrolls in case you need to rebuff mid-fight. Being immune to Critical hits means you can use and abuse damage shields, and being over 24 Caster Levels means you won't be dispelled by anything that's not Mordenkainen's Disjunction or the Spell Breach line of spells, but that's a weakness that all these types of builds share. However, it takes you a LONG TIME to mature. PM immunities come only at level 24, then Epic Warding only at 33, undispellability only at 34, and trap skills only at 37. That means that throughout pretty much the build's whole life you need to be on your toes to make it through. You MUST learn to use dispel-and-breach-baiting tactics if you have any hope of successfully playing this guy. He certainly has the tools, so it's a matter of whether you know how to use them!<br/>\n<br/>\nLadies and Gentlemen, Xzar the Necromancer!<br/>\n<br/>\nNecromancer(29), Pale Master(10), Assassin(1),

ESF - Necromancy make your death spells really hard to resist.<br/>\n- 35 Caster Levels for the purposes of SR calculations<br/>\n- Can craft all Deadly Traps without a chance of failure, recover and set Epic Traps (might need to equip DEX items to do so).<br/>\n- Epic Mage Armor gives a lot of flexibility with gear.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeaknesses:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Low AC through the leveling process. Can have high AC with Epic Mage Armor and Expertise when desired.<br/>\n- Lowish HP (You can swap Expertise for Toughness if you want).<br/>\n- Low saves, but decent against spells because of Spellcraft bonus.<br/>\n- No Evasion. A ring of Improved Evasion is desirable.<br/>\n- Takes a long time to mature, so may not be novice-friendly.<br/>\n- Vulnerable to Dispel for a very long time, vulnerable to Breach and Mord's the whole time. (can be mitigated with in-game decisions)<br/>\n- Low AC and no Discipline make KD immunity items a MUST for this build. If there aren't any, I recommend you choose a different build.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, now that's he's literally an entirely new man, any thoughts?

There was no PM in AD&amp;D either. One could argue that he found the constitution he lacked in life through undeath lol. But other than that, this build fits the bill for him, don't you think?
