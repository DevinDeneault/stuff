As for the other thing, no.  The crossbow is the most common ranged weapon around, so the game will pile out the bolts.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

But it is slow process because the resultant stacks are small (IIRC only about 20/stack).<br/>\n<br/>\nTBH, even though they may not seem to drop often enough while venturing in the wild, there always seem to be enough weapon merchants in the town areas that sell both the mundane and magical versions in the modules and PWs I've played.  Eventually your random loot seeding luck will turn the corner and you will begin tripping over arrows.<br/>\n<br/>\nMyself, I always seem to find bullets.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
