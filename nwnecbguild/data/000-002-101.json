Also because, assuming a pre-epic BAB of no more than 15 (equating to 3 APR), Monk UBAB progression means you'll still get more than 3 APR pre-epic. So...?<br/>\n<br/>\nConfused cheers</div>",

For me, I provide the logic of how it works. All regular attacks are done at Monk Ubab protection normally (you'll just gain 5 or more AB on each of them), so take a regular monk progression and add 5 (or rather, the difference between your character's pre-epic BAB and 20, and you'll have the new attack schedule). You should NEVER EVER EVER (as Yunim demonstrated) aim for a BAB 16 or more on a Cleric, as I've already emphasized in my guide.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe EXTRA attack provided by Divine Power will be dealt with separately, as well as extra attacks from other sources (Haste, Flurry of Blows, etc..). Each of the new extra attacks will come at -5 from each other, not following UBAB progression.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's take my Magical Master, for example. Fully buffed at level 40, you should have 61 AB, 59 with FoB active.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis Attack Schedule with Haste, FoB and Divine Power will be:<br/>\n<br/>\nRegular: 59/56/53/50/47 + Extra: 59/54/49 (extra attacks from DP, Haste and FoB respectively)<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope this clarifies how it works.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the build you're trying to reach, the DEX version I have already made. Please look at <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/viewtopic.php?p=2659#p2659\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bigby's Small Hand Complex</a> for inspiration / reference.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!</div>",

And if you do wear Armor + Shield, you lose all your stuff. There might be something there, but I reckon it's unlikely.</div>",
