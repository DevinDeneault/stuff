If not, posted it below), though now I'm playing on Amia server and there's a little problem with this particular build over there. I was hoping any one of you could help me refine it since my knowledge in character building is very limited.<br/>\nThe build has 38 Sorcerer, 1 Paladin, 1 Monk - Paladin for Divine Grace, Monk for Tumble &amp; Discipline (I guess..)<br/>\nProblem is, on Amia the rules for <strong>Divine Grace have changed:</strong><br/>\n\"The saving throw bonus is capped to Paladin level (e.g. a level 3 Paladin would only receive a maximum of +3 saves from Divine Grace, no matter how high their Charisma modifier is).\"<br/>\nSo I'm thinking the paladin level is no good. Is that right?<br/>\nAnd on top of that, <strong>level cap on Amia is at 30.</strong><br/>\nWhat would be a great build for that server, then?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the build: (Credits to cdaulepp)\n<blockquote><div>Exalted Sorceress<br/>\nSorcerer: 38 <br/>\nPaladin: 1 <br/>\nMonk: 1 <br/>\n<br/>\nRace: Human <br/>\nAlignment: Lawful Good <br/>\n<br/>\nStarting Stats <br/>\nStr: 12 <br/>\nDex: 12 <br/>\nCon: 14 <br/>\nInt: 14 <br/>\nWis: 8 <br/>\nCha: 16 <br/>\n<br/>\nFinal Stats <br/>\nStr: 12 <br/>\nDex: 12 <br/>\nCon: 14 <br/>\nInt: 14 <br/>\nWis: 8 <br/>\nCha: 30 <br/>\n<br/>\nSkills <br/>\nConcentration: 43 <br/>\nDiscipline: 43 <br/>\nHeal: 3 <br/>\nLore: 43 <br/>\nSpellcarft: 42 <br/>\nTumble: 43 <br/>\n<br/>\nEquipment <br/>\nFull Plate <br/>\nTower shield <br/>\nStaff <br/>\n<br/>\n1 Sorceress Concentration 4, Lore 4, Spellcraft 4, Save 8 Extend Spell, Expertise <br/>\n2 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 10 <br/>\n3 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 12 Improved Expertise <br/>\n4 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 14 Charisma <br/>\n5 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 16 <br/>\n6 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 18 Empower Spell <br/>\n7 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 20 <br/>\n8 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 22 Charisma <br/>\n9 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 24 Spell Focus: Necromancy <br/>\n10 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 26 <br/>\n11 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 28 <br/>\n12 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 30 Greater Spell Focus: Necromancy Charisma <br/>\n13 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 32 <br/>\n14 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 34 <br/>\n15 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 36 Maximize Spell <br/>\n16 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 38 Charisma <br/>\n17 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 40 <br/>\n18 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 42 Still Spell <br/>\n19 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 44 <br/>\n20 Paladin Concentration 1, Discipline 23, Lore 1, Save 24 Charisma <br/>\n21 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 2, Save 25 Combat Casting <br/>\n22 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 27 <br/>\n23 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 29 <br/>\n24 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 31 Epic Skill Focus: Discipline, Automatic Still Spell 1 Charisma <br/>\n25 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 33 <br/>\n26 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 35 <br/>\n27 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 37 Automatic Still Spell 2, Automatic Still Spell 3 <br/>\n28 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 39 Charisma <br/>\n29 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 41 <br/>\n30 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 43 Great Charisma 1, Epic Spell Focus: Necromancy <br/>\n31 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 45 <br/>\n32 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 47 Charisma <br/>\n33 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 49 Great Charisma 2, Epic Spell: Epic Warding <br/>\n34 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 51 <br/>\n35 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 53 <br/>\n36 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 55 Great Charisma 3, Epic Spell: Epic Mage Armor Charisma <br/>\n37 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 57 <br/>\n38 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 59 <br/>\n39 Sorceress Concentration 1, Lore 1, Spellcraft 1, Save 61 Great Charisma 4, Improved Combat Casting <br/>\n40 Monk Concentration 1, Discipline 38, Heal 3, Lore 1, Tumble 43 Charisma</div></blockquote>\nWhat would be a great build for that server, then?<br/>\nI am thinking 29 Sorc 1 Monk, where as the 1 Monk is last level. Am I mistaking?<br/>\nAlso, is 12 DEX necessary? I understand 12 STR is for carrying heavy armor &amp; such, but what about DEX?<br/>\nThank you SO MUCH in advance, I love this build and can't wait to play it on Amia.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

First let me ask you something about your server. Is the dark blessing from Blackguard capped there too? If not then we can change the build somewhat to have this instead of Paladin and still get the bonus to our saves from the high Charisma. But i think its hard they missed that..,<br/>\n<br/>\nApart from that, you have to understand that this is a build that works much better in a lvl 40 environment and that incorporate it into Amia's 30 lvl one will need some changes. Thankfully \"exalted sorceress\" takes Auto-still 3 feat within the 30 lvl boundaries so you won't have a problem with that at least. But what about the expertise/ improved expertise feats, does your server also forbid the usage of these feats while casting? Many other PW's have done that by enabling the auto-switch in the toolset. In that case you need to replace these feats with something else, for example power attack &amp; cleave in case we can take Blackguard instead of Paladin.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, for the dexterity you don't need it at 12. Not from a power-gaming point of view. If it was me, i would simply trust into in-game equipment plus personal buffs to raise those numbers where i want them (12 DEX &amp; 14 STR) and start with STR 10, DEX 08, CON 14, INT 14, WIS 08, CHA 18 for example. Also i would not take combat casting/ improved combat casting at all in your limited environment, since i would not have the plethora of feats normally available in a lvl 40 PW.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope i helped somewhat,<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I don't think I need Power Attack &amp; Cleave, especially if I'm not taking a Paladin / Blackguard.<br/>\nAnd why not Combat Casting &amp; Improved? Perhaps I can swap the Exp for CC?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd last question  Are you sure about the 12 DEX?  I mean, this build's creator was a genius, he must have done that for a reason...

And you get Cleave for free when you take Monk.<br/>\nPower attack is only needed if you want to qualify for Divine shield. But then you also need Str 13 and at least 3 levels of BG or Paladin or 1 level of Cleric to get Turn undead. In that respect Cleric is a viable alternative to Paladin and BG since the bonus to saves from Divine grace/Dark blessing is limited. DS gives a good boost to AC, but building that way deviates from the \"Exalted sorceress\" proper.<br/>\n<blockquote><div>\nAnd last question  Are you sure about the 12 DEX?  I mean, this build's creator was a genius, he must have done that for a reason... Maybe it's needed for Monk's Evasion?</div></blockquote>\nThe Exalted sorceress is a premium example of a power build. You have 38 caster levels which is almost as powerful as 40 levels. And you get a LOT from the two levels of Paladin and Monk:<br/>\n1 level of Paladin gives the AC of a warrior from the Heavy armor and Shield proficiencies. With the Auto still feats, you can cast in full armor without any restrictions. <br/>\nThe single paladin level also gives a gigantic + 10-16 boost to all saves from Divine grace. <br/>\nThe Monk level gives access to Tumble as class skill. 40 ranks grants +8 to AC.  Monk also gives Evasion which works very well together with the high saves vs many spells and traps.<br/>\nBoth Paladin and Monk have Discipline as class skill. A high Discipline rank protects against Knockdown and certain other special attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the 12 Dex, it is quite simple. A Full plate armor gives +8AC and allows a +1 AC from Dexterity. With 12 Dex you get that +1 AC.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

How come?)<br/>\nAlthough the paladin charisma stat boost won't work on Amia, the armor &amp; shield feats are very much needed. Perhaps a different class that has armor &amp; shield feats would be better than a Paladin? Will there be a difference?<br/>\nAnd last question - Combat Casting &amp; Improved are probably a bad call (Thanks Valerfor) as if I'm only level 30 &amp; Improved combat casting is an epic feat, perhaps Spell Penetration &amp; Improved (before hitting epic levels) is a good idea? Otherwise I wouldn't know what other Pre Epic feats to choose from.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd as for stats, I'm thinking of Valerfor's stats attribution - <br/>\n10 STR<br/>\n8 DEX<br/>\n14 CON<br/>\n14 INT<br/>\n8 WIS<br/>\n18 CHA<br/>\n<br/>\nWouldn't it be better than the 12 DEX just for the extra AC?<br/>\nThanks for the answers guys, I love the care<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I suggested Power Attack &amp; Cleave before simply because he was going to take that Monk lvl as his last one, so he could not possibly qualify for BG and take these three lvls at the same time, as there would not be enough lvls to do so. But it seems that the builders didn't miss that point too, so it is just a hypothesis anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\nDavid, this is what i was talking about when i said it is tough to fit a lvl 40 power-build into a lvl 30 environment that has further gimped a portion, of it's two additional sources of power. Keep the concept but adjust to your needs is what i suggest. Things to keep are definitely the Auto-still 3 feats &amp; ESF: Necromancy in Epics along with that last lvl of Monk if you care about end-game power.You do want to add another class to the mix like Paladin for the fear immunity &amp; Divine Shield but you need to adjust your build in chunks of three, since there is where Sorcerers take their Epic bonus feats. Something like Sorcerer 26/ Paladin 3/ Monk 1 would be the ideal split for that. But something tells me that they have limited the amount of AC you can get from Divine Shield according to the Paladin/BG lvls? If that's true then go Straight Sorcerer 29/ Monk 1 and be done with it, it is not like the build will be bad anyway, no true Caster is!<br/>\n<br/>\nTo capitalize. The Original \"Exalted Sorceress\" was build with the concept of an Armoured Caster in mind that drew power from token lvls of additional classes that had great synergy with her main stat (CHA). You do need Heavy Armour proficiency to take full advantage of that and Paladin will give you that for free along with fear immunity and Divine Shield. Monk at last lvl will give you Evasion, Cleave &amp; full Tumble Ranks &amp; allow you to max Discipline. That is why the (Sorceress 26/ Paladin 3/ Monk 1) split is ideal for you. You will get 6 Epic feats  to play with including the bonus from Epic Sorceress. You will need 3 for the Auto-still feats, 1 for the ESF: Necromancy and you will have 2 more to play with. Take with both of them Great CHA feats to end in a nice even score of 26 (38). Finally adjust your initial stats to the following: STR 13 DEX 08 CON 14 INT 14 WIS 08 CHA 17<br/>\n<br/>\nPre-epic you will need Power attack before you can take Divine Shield at your third Paladin lvl. Also you need Still spell for the Auto-still epic line &amp; Sf and Gr. Sf: Necromancy. You will have four feats left that is up to you. Empower spell &amp; Extend spell are both very good choices and you can also pick up Spell Penentration &amp; Greater Spell Penentration to cover up your four lost Caster levels. Maximize spell ain't that good nor is Toughness.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's all man, i hope i helped you build that lvl 30 \"Exalted Sorceress\" you so wanna play  <br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: And yes, i am sure about that DEX being left at base value. Let it sink to the bottom of the sea all the way to (08), a single Undispellable cast of Cat's Grace from you will rise it up to 12 where you get full AC bonuses.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Don't take divine shield at all but do select the domain that rises to the next lvl your summons for example. Animal Domain it is, a useful one but i do not know how summons fare there. Basically you just need 1 lvl of a class that has Heavy armour proficiency and that's it. The one that i suggested is maybe better under these circumstances, you will get at least fear immunity and +3 AC/ +3 saves for the duration (which thankfully at least is uncapped).

I'm seeing scythe warriors doing crits close to 200! (level 17) - so unbalaned. Though I tried your server (WoG) and it was empty :/<br/>\nI've done the Dex 8 Str 10 Cha 18 stat build &amp; I'm level 14 now, was wondering when to take the PAL level and when the monk? Pre epic or post? Or it doesnt matter?<br/>\nAnd why do I have 14 INT again?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

But you can take it as early as 27th and at least max Tumble with the Monk. It will give you Evasion earlier too.<br/>\n<br/>\nINT 14 is required for skills, since Sorcerers don't have many skill points (only 2) and you typically need Spellcraft, Concentration, Tumble, Discipline &amp; have some spare skills for server specific things, like you said lore or whatever. You can do with as much as 12 INt but not lower than that, at least not for me. <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso if you checked my last post i said you to go with a Paladin 3/ Monk 1/ Sorcerer 26 Build instead and Starting abilities of : STR 13 DEX 08 CON 14 INT 14 WIS 08 CHA 17, so you would be able to get Divine Shield but that's okay now, keep playing, casters are strong even without Divine Shield or Might. Take 1 Paladin lvl pre-epic to give you CHA modifier to saves (a massive boost) plus all the armour proficiencies and take Monk the earliest at 27th lvl to max Tumble and get your Evasion. Don't forget you need \"still spell\" before you can take the \"Auto Still\" feats in Epic. Max Discipline when you take that Paladin lvl and again when you take Monk. That's all man, keep us informed how it goes<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
