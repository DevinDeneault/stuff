With 35 caster levels, the penetration feats are not a must have.<br/>\n I am a bit confused about the weapon finesse. Do you intend to do some melee mage style play with a buffed up kama?<br/>\n I see that you start with dex 16 and con 14. That makes me curious about why you have chosen elf.<br/>\n At Monk 3 you get the monk speed feat. Have you ever buffed up a character with 3 or more monk levels with several castings of expeditious retreat, and seen what happens when you start to move? If you like that effect, you want Monk 3 much earlier. Wizard 35/ Monk 4/ SD1 will be an alternative if you still want a late monk level for skill-dump.<br/>\n Wizard 35/ PM 1/SD 4 is definitely an alternative if you use a race that gives xp penalty with wizard/ monk. Rogue is also an alternative if you want an \"arcane trickster\".<br/>\n<br/>\n Here is a halfling Wizard 35/ PM 1/ SD4 that I found on my hard drive.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hey dude!<br/>\n<br/>\n Thank god I see a build posted for critiquing here instead of a request. Good stuff, Kal!<br/>\n<br/>\n Allright, let's start at the beginning and move on from there, shall we? There are a few things I need to ask you in order to critique the build more accurately, so here we go:<br/>\n<br/>\n 1- Why are you making a Wizard / SD? What does HiPS give you that Invisibility doesn't where you play?<br/>\n<br/>\n 2- Why Conjuration focus? What spells are you planning to cast that need increased DCs from the Conjuration school? Or is it a server-specific thing that Conjuration focus grants you some cool features?<br/>\n<br/>\n 3- Why Weapon Finesse? I know you gain AB, which can be used with a Kama, but you have a WORSE BAB (actually tied with Cosmic Tomato for worst ever BAB score in the ECB lol :D) than a pure Wizard would, and when you shift to something else to fight, your DEX gets overwritten, so why waste a feat there? And you don't have Blind Fight, so again, why?<br/>\n<br/>\n 4- Why Discipline? You will likely have more than 63 AC (depending on where you plan to play this build, of course), which is the best possible total you can reach in Discipline if you roll a 20 on your die, so you'll only be saved if the guy rolls a 20 and hits but the total is lower than your AC.<br/>\n<br/>\n I ask these questions because my suggestions may lead you both ways. You'll hardly ever hit anything, so my instinct tells me you shouldn't go for focusing on combat at all, if anything, you'd want defensive feats such as Dodge and Mobility, which are fortunately requirements for SD, and the rest you could use with Metamagic feats. Also, crafting feats can be extremely useful. You can take Craft Wand there instead of Weapon Finesse, for example, and make tons of Wands of ILMS for when you run out of spells or when you want to conserve your spells for battles that lie ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\n Another thing that Mick has already pointed out is that you don't really need that 2nd SD level. It does give you Evasion, but so does Monk 1, so it's redundant, and you're not taking advantage of the \"speedy caster\" approach for the entirety of the build because Monk 3 only comes at 40. If you made it Monk 4 SD 1 instead, you could take the 3rd Monk level at 27 and from then on have the \"faster than it should be legal to be\" mode available. The combo is decribed in WhiZard's Speedy Caster and Mick's Evil Speedy Caster builds, here in the ECB! You gotta find them, though, cuz I'm too lazy to look and we don't have a Search Engine yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n The rest seems to be in place, although I would suggest not taking SD until epics because with near-pure casters such as this one, you want to have as many spells as you possibly can as soon as you possibly can, so aim for Wizard 17 straight off the bat for all spell levels as soon as possible. Your way of killing things is spells and summons, and the higher the level, the more useless the summons become, so delaying them just a couple of levels will hurt the playability of the build.<br/>\n<br/>\n What I do like is the ESFs in Hide and Move Silently. Nice touch! That's Building Finesse right there!<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi Guys,<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks for the replies.<br/>\n<br/>\n There were a couple of things that I wasn't sure which way to go on when I was working on this guy, and from the responses I may have gone the wrong way.<br/>\n<br/>\n I mainly went elf for the weapon proficiencies so that I had Longbow as a ranged backup. Once I'd done this I figured I may as well take Finesse just in case. (Although with HiPS I probably shouldn't have too much trouble maintaining range). The other option was to go Dwarf and shift the starting stats to STR10 DEX14 CON16 INT18 WIS8 CHA6.<br/>\n<br/>\n I was looking more to the PM/SD route but only considered SD1/PM4 which would not have left me any tumble dumps, that's the main reason I went to Monk.<br/>\n<br/>\n Where I was planning to play this, the crafting feats have been disabled (otherwise Craft Wand would have been in there). Invis Scrolls are available but I figured that HiPS has infinite uses and is not tied into a concentration check. The death penalty is quite steep so stuff not firing when you need it to can be quite frustrating.<br/>\n<br/>\n I went for the Conjuration focus as with 35 caster levels I did not think the Spell Pen line fo feats was needed, also I read somewhere (It may have been in GDL's Pale Emissary build) the Conj boosts the EBT DC's. \u00a0Although I havent really played a lot of casters so I could be talking out my.....<br/>\n<br/>\n I have seen the speedy Monk/Wiz builds but that was not what I was going for, Monk was mainly for Tumble dumps.<br/>\n<br/>\n And again I know that early SD is not optimal but I was aiming at getting it as a defensive measure ASAP.<br/>\n<br/>\n I've just got to work but I'll try and find time to play around and post soemthing else later on today.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks again for your help.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">It does boost EBT, Kal, I was just curious, because EBT is a level 4 spells, so even with a high innate DC, the low level of the spell will cost you 5 DC already (spell level is factored into spell DC calculations, which I presume you know). Then if you also consider that the spell has a Fortitude save, which is also the save that is attacked by the Necromancy spells, and you have a very limited Wizard who is great at attacking low-fortitude types and not good against anything else. When playing casters, you generally want to consider \"enemy types\" and their likely \"weak saves\" (please read my Playing Better guide in the Game Guides Section for more on this), so you already have plenty of spells that attack the Fort save in the necromancy school, which will KILL the fuckers directly instead of paralyzing them, but then when you face a high-fort type of enemy, what do you do? May I suggest Evocation focus instead, which will attack the Reflex save and is EXCELLENT against enemies without Evasion and has an often-overlooked fantastic spell called Great Thunderclap, which has an effect that attacks each of the saves (will for stun effect, Fort for Deafness, which is shit but it doesn't matter because you have the Necromancy spells to deal with the low fort types and finally Reflex for the knockdown effect, which lasts 6 seconds (1 round)). It's a great 3 in 1 spell that will allow you to always have the upper hand in attacking enemy saves. Plus, Great Thunderclap is a level 7 spell, which is much better than EBT's level 4.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, may I suggest Silent Spell instead of Extend Spell? You have 35 CLs, so Extend is not a must, and unlike Clerics, which have Divine Favor that ALWAYS needs extending, Wizards don't have any spell that MUST be extended, so Silent spell will allow you to memorize attack spells one level higher than they are, giving you much needed and desirable spellbook management.<br/>\n<br/>\n If Craft Wand is disabled and you want to go for Finesse, I suggest you squeeze Blind Fight in there as well, probably for Maximize Spell.<br/>\n<br/>\n At least for me, Maximize is not that useful for Wizard characters, because I'm not going to relinquish a chance to stop time for maxed IGMS, and the previous levels can all be filled in with better spells than anything miximizable, so I really don't see the point in having it. For Sorcerers it's much better because they have that \"at the moment I need this spell\" approach, so it can be useful, since you don't actually need to pre-prepare anything, except for when you're going to level up!<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

points of Int.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm considering dropping the last SD level back to 39 to squeeze a couple of extra points out of Hide and Move silently even though it will delay my last tumble dump by 2 levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n Are any of the other Epic Spells worth taking ?  I heard various opinions on their usefulness.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks again !<br/>\n<br/>\n PS: In a rush, I'll finish sorting out the skills later, It will probably be similar to what Mick posted under his build<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">The build looks awesome, except for the fact you take SD 2 at 17 (presuming that you won't take my advice on delaying SD 1 till after 17th level straight away lol), brother. delaying your first 8th level spells. I would suggest delaying it until after Wizard 17 so you can get lvl 9 spells earlier. Other than that it looks very cool. You can use Firebrand to deal with mobs of low reflex saves and non-evasion types. Evard's will still be helpful against low-fort types, since their weak save won't supercede your int bonus. Overall very effective caster with a sneaky way of avoiding danger. It's a good toon to play in PnP, where the approach is not as hack-and-slash as here. In NWN you are faced with the problem that you need to tackle the forces of evil all the time, not the other way around.<br/>\n<br/>\n Good job!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">PM 1 gives the same extra spellslots as a wizard level does. You will not learn new spells at that level up, but you can learn spells from scrolls if you want.<br/>\n As a general rule, you want to advance wizard levels without any delay to keep adequate spellpower. In this case you also want to keep the stealth skills high to be able to benefit from HIPS. Taking SD twice pre epic for that purpose will work. Your spell progression will lag 2 levels behind, but HIPS is really powerful when you spam it.<br/>\n Even with full level mages, the penetration feats can be of some value during levelling, if you play on a PW and like the challenge of going to places meant for higher level characters. But normally they are not essential unless you play a multiclassed spellsword. You can always lower the SR with the breach line of spells, including Mordenkainen's disjunction<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
