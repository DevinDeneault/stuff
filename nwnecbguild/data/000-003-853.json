If you look at Grimnir's original there's no Dev Crit, though he does go for 2 Weapons of Choice/ WF (Battleaxe and Warhammer), so if you were just to concentrate on one weapon you might be more able to mitigate that number of feats used for some more - dare I say it - defensive ones (and Blind Fight becomes more available as well).
