      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Greetings, all. I have returned to this game after many years under the allure of the Enhanced Edition and decided to try a caster for the first time instead of my usual preference for melee characters. Going with a Sorceress, because... reasons!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhoo, my lovely little budding human Sorc has been merrily working her way through chapter one of the OC, anxiously running circles around a mage-armor-buffed Daelan or Grimnaw to draw aggro to them (as I have read in many places is the thing to do) while praying for good rolls from her Wand of Sleep, plinking away at what she can with a crossbow and taking a shot with Burning Hands when it seems efficient to do so. Actually, she soloed the open streets in Beggar's Nest because the slow moving zombies are just such ripe (pun intended), and fun, targets for Burning Hands.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, we've got level III spells just around the corner and the seemingly obvious Fireball as a choice. But, in looking at the other \"nuke\" in the third level arsenal, I see that Scintillating Sphere is basically the same spell other than range and element. I know it might seem like a no-brainer that the greater range is better, but I've been playing around with Pretty Good Character Creator in the test area and happen to think the electric zap is cooler than the fire blast.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd we all know that looking cool is important. <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\nConsidering that just about EVERYthing rushes you to melee in this game, does the range really matter all that much? Is there ever a good reason for the preference of lightning over fire in the earlier levels? I do realize it's just a level 3 spell and other things will be more important a little further down the road. But I'm one of those people who enjoys the leveling process, trying to learn what I can, and having a little fun along the way.<br/>\n<br/>\ntldr: Is there ever a reason to take Scintillating Sphere over Fireball?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Probably less so in dungeons and interiors where you have umpteen guards/goblins/whatever suddenly swarming the doorway you just opened.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs it happened, my Sorc leveled up on the 3rd kill upon entering the Docks District. So I did my usual pre-level-up-save and then made a couple runs with both of these spells, with Daelan in tow, against the Muggers and Thugs roaming the streets, as well as Androd's mansion for some close quarter action. I had him stand his ground while I did the casting from a distance thing and found out you do get fewer surprise attacks with the shorter range.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving the henchman ball them up is mostly pointless because between cleave and attacks of opportunity, they can drop 3 enemies in the time it takes you to wind up one spell and your big AoE nuke of glory fizzles out on a single target.<br/>\n<br/>\nI then tried a third option and swapped out Melf's for Flame Weapon and took the Dire Wolf summon for that first level 3 spell. Dismissed Daelan and did the run again with just the wolf, and I gotta say... I was pleasantly surprised. A level 6 Flame Weapon feels like it lasts a looong time and the wolf has knockdown to boot. At this point I think it's a better option than just having 4 AoE spells that <em>might</em> do good damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom what I've been reading this is not all that surprising nor disappointing. She's still basically a humble party buffer whose crossbow bolts of lightning and frostbite do more damage than a few spells per day. And Burning Hands is still useful at this level, methinks.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill not decided on the two spells in question, nor have I dismissed them altogether, either. Just putting them on hold for now, so the feedback is still muchly appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\ntldr: Dire Wolf + Flame Weapon beats Fireball/Shockball... <em>for now</em>.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I'm a mostly casual (though sometimes serious) gamer and I'm still finding the OC to have it's challenges. Playing on normal mode, btw, so no damage to party members from AoE. It's a good boot camp for learning the game system. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy Cleric/Fighter was fairly easy to play through the OC with. And my Rogue/Fighter/Shadow Dancer made the run through SoU/HotU fairly painless. I'm enjoying the learning curve with this Sorceress. And I am having to do quite a bit of lernin' with all these spells and whatnot. But that's what makes this game so interesting, IMHO.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeverwinter Nights was my introduction to the world of D&amp;D back in 2005 and came at a time when I needed a good distraction from mundane, everyday life. I quickly became quite engrossed with it then, and revisiting it now is stirring up a lot of fond remembrances.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I guess I kinda' answered my own question. But then, I think asking the question is what prompted me to do my own little bit of exploration. I'm not exactly \"worrying\" about anything, just trying to maximize the satisfaction of winning a few tough fights here and there. <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">@ UrbanHermit, when you become more experienced with your Sorceress you will see that almost all of the direct damage spells in the game are sub-par, to say the least. That's because of the necessarily abstract nature of the game compared to the \"real\" hit points your enemies would have in Pen &amp; Paper D&amp;D. Battlefield control &amp; instant-death spells will become your bread &amp; butter later in the game with the possible exception of \"horrid wilting\" which is a good spell to have in nearly any mage. Till you get there, \"firebrand\" is an adequate choice, especially for the core rules difficulty &amp; of course...Isaack's greater missile storm. <br/>\n<br/>\nGood gaming!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">UrbanHermit,<br/>\nAs a frequent wizard player, I don't usually find myself taking many damage dealing spells until I get 4th level spells. The buffs are just too good, especially when combined with a decent henchman and a summon.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo illustrate at level 8 (for sorcerer, 7 for wizard), drop an extended Flame Weapon, regular Bull's, and regular Mage Armor on a summoned dire wolf. Watch the magic happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, both Scintillating Sphere and Fireball top out at caster level 10, making other spells much more useful at 11+.<br/>\nMy favorite level 3 buffs:<br/>\nGreater Magic Weapon<br/>\nHaste<br/>\nKeen Edge<br/>\n<br/>\nUtility:<br/>\nFind Traps<br/>\nSummon Monster III<br/>\n<br/>\nMy favorite level 3 offensive spells:<br/>\nFlame Arrow<br/>\nStinking Cloud<br/>\nNegative Energy Burst<br/>\nSlow<br/>\n<br/>\nIn particular, Flame Arrow and Negative Energy Burst are both lack-luster at low levels, but really start to become great at caster level 20+. In contrast, Stinking Cloud and Slow are always nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo further expand on my fondness for Stinking Cloud, it's great as an area denial effect. Unless the targets are poison immune (monks, druids, or gear), it's AoE with a round/level duration. Even against high saves, everyone rolls a 1 eventually. Its daze shuts down most offensive actions and renders characters without uncanny dodge flat-footed. Sit back, let your elemental summon melee in the cloud, while you shoot them with a crossbow, cast other spells, loot, or get a drink all while standing off to the side in safety. With the creatures in the cloud rolling to save every round, combined with the duration, Stinking Cloud clearly out performs most other level 3 spells. It may not be as flashy, or do any damage, but it will cause the demise of your opponents.<br/>\n<br/>\nA final thought, if you play wizard, this is another reason to take a level of rogue early. Those crossbow shots on dazed opponents will all be sneak attacks.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Unfortunately, can't use Flame Weapon on him since he fights unarmed.

I'm not playing a pure Sorcerer. I gave her 3 levels of Bard. It's a theme build. You know... the singing sorceress thing. Yes, I'm aware that there are no real synergies with Sorcerer/Bard other than sharing Charisma. But, it <em>is</em> the OC and I knew this was basically going to be a henchman/summons support play-through, ending at around level 17, and decided to have a little RP fun with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI used the Bard levels for skill dumps. 10 points Tumble, 5 points UMD at level 10. With 20 CHA that makes 10 UMD which allowed her to buy monk gear from the priest at Tyr's Temple in chapter 2. Dark Moon Robes for the perma-haste +4 AC, and Sun Soul Boots for the +2 Dodge AC. Add +1 from 12 DEX and +2 from Tumble and she's got 19 AC unbuffed in cloth. Mage Armor + Shield + a potion of Barkskin and she's at 28 AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nLevel 3 Bard Song gives +1 Attack and +2 Damage, essentially making it a temporary universal combo of Weapon Focus + Weapon Specialization for the henches and summons, as well as her own X-bow shots. Extra Music taken at Bard 1 lets her sing 7 times per day.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt level 12, now, she's got Extend Spell, Greater Spell Penetration and Spell Focus: Evocation (in anticipation of Firebrand).<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than delaying her Sorcerer levels, it seems to be working pretty good, so far. But it's the Sorcerer class that has me the most interested, and hence, my inquiry here. I have every intention of playing a pure Sorcerer for a second run through SoU/HotU after this friendly little romp through the OC. Which, I imagine, is where the real Sorcerer training will take place. Following that I'd finally like to get around to taking on <em>The Aielund Saga</em> with an Exalted Sorceress, or similar build.<br/>\n<br/>\nI humbly thank those who have thus far replied and appreciate your kind indulgence of my ramblings.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Perhaps qualities such as vision, drive, ambition, passion and creativity.\u00a0<br/>\nSheer workforce certainly helps I guess, but I do worry about overly hierarchical corporate environments which could stifle creativity.<br/>\nAt the other extreme, I read about other environments exist where employees can do what they wish, work on what project they wish, and decisions are made by democratic voting by employees rather than management, marketing or shareholders deciding.<br/>\nReally interesting to know what it is about environments that fosters successful, creative and productive teams.<br/>\n<br/>\nLarian Studios seems to be having a good run securing the Baldurs Gate 3 project from Wizards of the Coast. I suspect WotC already decided to choose them based on their track record, well before they brought their sales pitch.<br/>\nIn contrast Blizzard is having a terrible run over the last 6-12 months with WC3 Reforged (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/warcraft-iii-reforged\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a user score of 0.5 / 5 on MetaCritic</a>!), Overwatch and other stuff receiving very negative press and reviews, and it is interesting to see how they will drag themselves out of the troubles they are in.\u00a0<br/>\nI suspect they have forgotten the consumer and the importance of producing a great product that people want to buy into that they see as good value.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was shocked to read installing Reforged deleted your old WC3 installation, all the WC3 old custom maps one made, and any further custom maps that you create become the copyright property of Activision Blizzard. I think it's a very delayed kneejerk reaction to Dota 2 and League of Legends success, which were inspired by an old WC3 multiplayer custom map.<br/>\nHope that doesn't happen with NWN, for all the custom module makers and DMs for PW's out there.

I took a quick look at Weidu. Definitely like the idea of playing BG with the improved BG2 engine. And I see BG2 Ultimate Collection, also for $12.99, at Amazon.

When first talking to him to get his story started, he mentioned an interest in the Hill Giants in the area. So, in a moment of RP, I decided to take him along to satisfy his gnomish curiosity. Not that m'lady need another sorcerer at her side, but she was curious herself to see what spells he would use. <br/>\n<br/>\nPrismatic Spray is very pretty! <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, she got distracted by the cave and Mr. Glinckle thought it would be a good idea to run through a Drow Priest's Blade Barrier. That didn't go so well and he was whisked away back to Tyr's Temple. Upon seeing that she decided to borrow from the gnome's sense of logic and made a tactical decision... run.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I have learned for sure, playing a caster... running is always an option. She waited for the BB of death to wear out and went back to carry on. And in all fairness, I did have to reload once when she failed a death spell. But then, that's what the \"G\" key is for, right? <br/>\n<br/>\nAll in all, it was a successful encounter and I was quite pleased with how we handled it.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You wonder from dungeon to dungeon &amp; kill things, buy more stuff then kill bigger things &amp; somewhere in there is a story that may or may not get to you. There is no interaction between the NPCs neither the brilliant magic system of its big brother. That being said, IWD 1 is superior to IWD 2 &amp; it has some strengths versus BG, namely the lovely music &amp; art-style. There is also more combat involved in general. <br/>\n<br/>\n<span data-s9e-mediaembed=\"youtube\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:100%;max-width:640px\"><span style=\"display:block;overflow:hidden;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GBqL1ZjVCRc\" style=\"background:url(https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GBqL1ZjVCRc/hqdefault.jpg) 50% 50% / cover;border:0;height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;width:100%\"></iframe></span></span><br/>\n<br/>\nPlanescape Torment goes the other way around. It is considered by some to be even greater than BG (it is not) because the story is superb (nameless one) the interactions between the NPCs are the best but there is one big caveat. There is almost next to no combat. It also features some very \"cinematic\" high-level spells, those must have been the best the world had seen by that time, truly next level in production value. <br/>\n<br/>\n<span data-s9e-mediaembed=\"youtube\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:100%;max-width:640px\"><span style=\"display:block;overflow:hidden;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OKZZEPoVb4c\" style=\"background:url(https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OKZZEPoVb4c/hqdefault.jpg) 50% 50% / cover;border:0;height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;width:100%\"></iframe></span></span><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then, there is Temple of Elemental Evil, not an Infinity Engine game but a good D&amp;D 3.0 RPG with similar UI to Baldur's Gate but with two important differences. One is that the game is turn-based &amp; not real-time with pause (better for some people, but I prefer real-time action)\u00a0 &amp; the other is that the game is taking place mostly in a big dungeon crawl, so its scope is limited in comparison. Still a good game though &amp; one of the last of that era. <br/>\n<br/>\n<span data-s9e-mediaembed=\"youtube\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:100%;max-width:640px\"><span style=\"display:block;overflow:hidden;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xNPqwMcSiXE?start=155\" style=\"background:url(https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xNPqwMcSiXE/hqdefault.jpg) 50% 50% / cover;border:0;height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;width:100%\"></iframe></span></span><br/>\n<br/>\nIn my opinion, though, Baldur's Gate Saga trumps them all, with ease.

You are, of course, free to decline them (or indeed have your prospective \"partner\" chuck you if you give the \"wrong\" responses).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also many side-quests in BG2 given to you by NPCs (some of which require said NPC to travel with you, but most do not), together with your own \"stronghold\" quest (which depends on what sort of character you're playing - warrior, mage, thief, etc). These all add colour, as well as xp and gear, but the main point of them is to get you to the level you will need to be to have any chance of success by the time you reach the finale. This is as true for BG1 as it is for BG2. Throne of Bhaal is much more linear (and all the poorer for it). In essence, explore the world of Baldur's Gate as much as you can - it's a marathon, not a sprint!<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: I would still install Dark Side of the Sword Coast. Albeit it's an \"unofficial\" BG1 module, it's perfectly compatible with the main game and requires no additional installations. It brings with it more and better gear and foes, together with an assortment of additional companions. These will benefit you throughout, regardless of whether you decide to complete the Dark Side quest line or not.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">If you have bought the original saga instead of the GOG release (Enhanced Edition) then there are three primary ways to play the game: <br/>\n<br/>\na) Play it like Stag does, with the <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Trilogy mod</span>, that may take hundreds of other mods &amp; stack them to the base game &amp; offers a sort of pseudo-continuity between BG I &amp; II. <br/>\n<br/>\nb) Play it with the <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Easy TuTu</span> setup which is a lot \"lighter\" than \"Trilogy\" &amp; offers a more plain-jane experience but closer to authentic. This is what I used to play after having a few of the Original Saga experiences. Here's the link to that =&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://usoutpost31.com/easytutu/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://usoutpost31.com/easytutu/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nc) Play it with just the Original Game, it's Expansion &amp; the Baldurdash fixes. Unfortunately, I won't be able to show you that way because the domain/site has expired after twenty years or so &amp; it's fixes are instead incorporated to the Gibberlings3 fixpack (Baldur's Gate II Fixpack) that despite the name works perfectly well for BG1 as well.\u00a0 Here's the link to the fixpack =&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://gibberlings3.github.io/Documentation/readmes/readme-bg2fixpack.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://gibberlings3.github.io/Document ... xpack.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nNow, here is where these three ways differentiate from each-other: The Original Saga + Baldurdash fixpack is all using the BG1 engine to run everything. There is none of the BG2 spells or enhancements/nerfs to the game. It is the \"Vanilla\" thing. That means between others, that arrows, for example, are \"killers\" &amp; that there are no dual-wielding options or stoneskin spell yet, neither are available spell-triggers &amp; such. The weapons are all separated in very broad categories (swords long &amp; short for example, instead of katanas, longswords, short-swords, greatswords, etc.) &amp; there is a distinct \"Stoney\" UI that through it you play the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nVanilla Game Inventory UI<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://simg.chomikuj.pl/093f308e1ff8cd2d5640f1be262f46806222c09a?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobygames.com%2Fimages%2Fshots%2Fl%2F331013-baldur-s-gate-windows-screenshot-inventory-screen-team-members.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://simg.chomikuj.pl/093f308e1ff8cd ... embers.png</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe Easy Tutu setup is using the BG II engine (&amp; all of its enchantments) to play both games meaning the game (BG1), overall, it's easier than intended because you can now have half-orc fighters that start with 19Str/19Con, you have dual-wielding &amp; you have Stoneskin for your mages. To counter that up, the game uses a few more spawns were it should &amp; it works quite well, especially if you have never seen the Original. Contrastingly, arrows are a lot weaker now, walking speed has been increased &amp; most importantly AD&amp;D's \"Kits\" for each class have entered the game. You'll no longer have a plain fighter but a lot of specializations to choose from, including the mighty Berserker. Paladins now have the Cavalier option &amp; Mages can now choose the Sorceress! The game is still awesome &amp; you'll quickly forget the differences once start playing, it's the gameplay that will keep you up the nights, not the graphics (as is the case with Neverwinter Nights). <br/>\n<br/>\nEasy TuTu Inventory UI<br/>\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" data-s9e-mediaembed=\"imgur\" onload=\"var c=new MessageChannel;c.port1.onmessage=function(e){var d=e.data.split(' ');style.height=d[0]+'px';style.width=d[1]+'px'};contentWindow.postMessage('s9e:init','https://s9e.github.io',[c.port2])\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://s9e.github.io/iframe/2/imgur.min.html#G3rXQ4v\" style=\"border:0;height:400px;max-width:100%;width:542px\"></iframe><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Trilogy setup is much like Easy TuTu but it also has the option for hundreds of mods that it handily manages for you (This is referring as \"The Big World setup\") &amp; it offers its own take on the transition between BGI &amp; II. The UI &amp; everything is completely BG II on this. <br/>\n<br/>\nBaldur's Gate Trilogy Inventory UI<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://media.moddb.com/images/members/1/283/282946/baldursgatetrilogy_inventory.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://media.moddb.com/images/members/ ... entory.jpg</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd just for contrast, the Enhance dEdition's Invenroty UI<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://us.v-cdn.net/5019558/uploads/FileUpload/ee/a11277ff86deecc06d0430acbe4506.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://us.v-cdn.net/5019558/uploads/Fi ... be4506.jpg</a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout the Dark Side mod, I would personally avoid it for my first playthrough with the game. To put it simply it completely changes the gameplay balance of the game introducing high-magic variables in every category. NPCs, Items, Spells, Levels, Enemies, etc. but I would instead suggest you to try it after you have completed the Original game at least once. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, my apologies for this wall-o-text but as a final comment, I would like to ask you (Stag or anyone else that knows BG II well enough). Doesn't the game music before you enter Yaga-Shura's temple reminds you of Basilis Poledouris CONAN?<br/>\n<span data-s9e-mediaembed=\"youtube\" style=\"display:inline-block;width:100%;max-width:640px\"><span style=\"display:block;overflow:hidden;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pXkcoIWRUrY\" style=\"background:url(https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pXkcoIWRUrY/hqdefault.jpg) 50% 50% / cover;border:0;height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;width:100%\"></iframe></span></span><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

First, it makes a nice change to have another view (although I'll 'fess up, I quite like the haughty Dynaheir original, even though it doesn't fit terribly well with the voice). And second, you could do like I do and hit that little symbol on the top right of the Gallery bit of the homepage (looks like a minus sign or a hyphen), which makes it all invisible. Then, if you want to see them all again, click it again, by which time it will look like an addition sign (essentially, they're collapsing and expanding).<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish you good travels in Baldur's Gate - but better ones in Neverwinter Nights!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I did a quick run through a clean, vanilla BG, first (stretched out on my widescreen as it was), up to the point of meeting Xzar and Montaron, for a refresher. I was actually surprised by how well I remembered it. <br/>\n<br/>\nI decided to give the BG1 NPC Project mod a try. No romances, just the general NPC tweaks/improvements. I did the same quick run after the Trilogy+mods install, and was pleasantly surprised, when retrieving the letter from Gorion's body, to have Imoen initiate a dialogue that didn't happen before.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of her responses suggests that you bury his body and then afterward says, \"Make sure I don't have to bury you too.\" It was a very nice improvement, IMHO, and added a little more emotional depth to the encounter than just silently looting his corpse and walking away. Plus, the extra music pack available for the NPC Project, that gives ambient music for the added unvoiced dialogues, uses a piece that I immediately recognized from NWN for Imoen. <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\nSo, yeah... win-win. Thumbs up for the NPC Project. At least, as far as I can tell so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I'm itching to actually <em>start</em> BG in earnest, but not until I complete my OC run.
