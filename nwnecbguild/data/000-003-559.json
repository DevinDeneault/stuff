A stealthy monk/rogue would be a fun way to explore a lot of those modules from childhood since you pay attention to details and have to use creative strategy to prevail (especially in SA immune areas).<br/>\n<br/>\nIm open to other builds too.\u00a0 Someone said Assassins are improved on WoG so maybe that too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your time!<br/>\n<br/>\nMamaB<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Lots and lots of sneak attack damage!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have written a Rogue 33 Monk 6 SD 1 draft, I have only playtested it to level 6.<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-flash-rogue-33-monk-6-shadowdancer-1-t2355434.html#p20294\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Flash</a><br/>\nBy dropping TWF/Ambi/Improved TW Fighting this would give you three feats to spend on what you wish.\u00a0<br/>\nYou can change the race to elf, as 20% multiclass penalties won't matter too much in a persistent world.<br/>\nWith the 6 ability points (+2 dex -2 con from elf, leave dex at 18) one can put Str to 14 and Int up to 10. Or whatever balance you wish.<br/>\nI also put probably too much HP, 300+ is probably enough.\u00a0<br/>\n(Usually you will want more 16+ monk levels if you want to use fists ie 1d20 fists, otherwise I would consider dual kamas with an elf for lots of attacks)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other rogue 33 drafts I have written. <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/viewtopic.php?p=20387#p20387\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Shadow of Corellion</a> others have enjoyed playing, it is an elf dual shortsword 6-7APR build, I have only playtested that one to 11 but I know Yogmister7 got that one up to level 30 very quickly.\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/avoreen-s-masterful-dagger-rogue-33-fighter-6-sd-1-t2355305.html#p18522\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Aroveen's Masterful Dagger</a> I haven't had a chance to playtest yet.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nValerfor who has played WoG extensively in the past made <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-sentry-of-anduin-rogue-33-fighter-6-shadowdanc-t2350497.html#p586\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Sentry of Anduin</a> which is a halfling Rogue 33 Fighter 6 SD 1 build shortsword + shield with +20d6 looks very nice, maybe there are adjustments one can make to make it an elf.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nTorias wrote a <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/viewtopic.php?p=152#p152\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rogue Archer</a> Rogue 33, Fighter 6, SD 1 (+27d6 sneak), very very nice as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that gives you some ideas. I think most well designed builds will work fine in WoG, there is some adjustment without pausing of course but one will learn how to manage this with time :)\u00a0I think amongst this lot there will be a concept you like more than another so definitely keep the conversation going, and as a group the guild members can give you suggestions to get you what you need, as a group the ECB is a veritable gold mine of experience and knowledge.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

These builds were exactly what I was looking for.\u00a0 Its easier to find builds with the search engine on the github, but typically the more recent builds here are more evolved but can get buried in all the posts.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlot of these builds would fit the bill for me, with just a little tweaking.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne question, I see your kama \"flash\" can get up to nine attacks.\u00a0 A non monk dual wielder like Corellon would max out at 7 attacks, correct?\u00a0 And a hasted bow wielder like the Rogue Archer would have 6 attacks per round.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother question, I do not see \"skill mastery\" in any of these builds.\u00a0 Would that not allow laying epic or deadly traps \"at the feet\" of enemies and be rather vaulable?<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, is HiPS altered on WoG or can it be used at will?

With HiPS you have an incredible strategic advantage as long as the enemy doesnt have real true seeing (ie a Dragon).\u00a0Its nice but probably not quite as strong as other options<br/>\nHiPS has a timer of 6 seconds I believe in WoG. In vanilla NWN HiPS has unlimited uses / round. NPC enemies only check stealth once every 6 seconds. So how OP is that :)\u00a0<br/>\nOh and strength is handy to have. I find myself regretting not putting Str to 14 on most of my rogue builds. (non rogues too). One can find ways to buff it up for non-sneak damage, and it helps for sure carrying mountains of loot across the vast plains of WoG. Not everything will be vulnerable to sneak attacks (ie Dragons, Undead, Constructs), so the extra Str is good, but for those who are vulnerable, they will not survive very long against a Rogue 33 build.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I cannot recall.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am expecting to dirtnap a lot, but I want to go slow and enjoy the first playthrough, so that's all part of the fun.<br/>\n<br/>\n6 seconds on HiPS sounds like a good change.\u00a0 I don't like the button mashing style of play anyhow.\u00a0 Rehiding every second to get another sneak attack would get tedious fast.\u00a0 HiPS, reposition, set a trap, then attack again sounds rather more fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood Orion, so Skill mastery does not look that useful.\u00a0 Now its just to choose which roguey build type....if I decide on range then I will try an elf rogue archer, but your flash build elfed out looks super fun, as does the second iteration of your Avoreen's Masterful Dagger, taking fighter instead of monk.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last question:\u00a0 In Aielund there were lots of Asian style weapons, like Wakizashi (short sword proficiency).\u00a0 If I did the Avoreen but with an elf, dual wielding short swords, are there some Asian models in Greyhawk? I like the look of wakizashi compared to classical short swords.\u00a0 In that light, what are some of the nice looking weapon models in WoG in your opinion?\u00a0 Are there some cool looking epic kama's in game as well? The kama's in Aielund were pretty boring.<br/>\n<br/>\nO, and what are ideal skill numbers for an epic trap master. ie Disable, Set, and Craft Trap?\u00a0 I want to be recovering and planting deadly and epic traps with ease.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks again everyone for the warm welcome.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I know it was discussed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have never attempted to make Traps on WoG as there are more than enough to Recover, and one can purchase them at specialty shops. YMMV.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo Disarm, one is going to need a modified level of 68 to Recover Epic Traps (which is what I do).

There are some ok late pre-epic kamas but I cannot recall a single epic kama.<br/>\nShortswords on the other hand, you will be very happy with. There are great epic shortswords that drop.\u00a0<br/>\nThere are\u00a0Wakizashis for sale but not a lot of enchanted ones.<br/>\nI cannot comment on looks as I haven't really modified them.

I'd only invest a few points at most, and try to look for items to boost your craft trap skills. I have been able to craft deadly electrical traps with no ranks in craft trap, but with lots of int and +craft traps boosts. Reagents can be tricky to obtain to make deadly traps, 7 / trap is significant, retrieving em is likely going to be your priority, I think. Making a handful of low level traps early game is very very powerful. With a decent low level trap field (ie minor ele/fire traps), bosses can be taken down early game much easier, as long as they dont have evasion! I think it is worth making minor traps early game. I find once my sneak attack damage is nice and high, plus I get equipment / UMD / sequencers, I dont have to rely so much on traps as I used to, which is a good thing, evasion is a pretty nasty counter to trap damage output.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
