While I value the hard lessons - both intentional and otherwise - that I learned at the hands of your many followers, I have since found another master. I always felt something viperous writhe in my stomach when you began anew your lessons in skulking, thieving, and murder with a new group of captive children. I could not see the twisting of life at your hands in my more tender years, but now, with ample experience and collected wisdom, I do. This new divine master goes by the name Chokra Broodslayer. When I first heard it, the name seemed to ring with meaning.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe were all your 'family,' were we not sir? I have grown very strong in the craft you had a hand in introducing to me. Very strong indeed. I come for you now, Patch. I will slink in the shadows alongside your best assassins and I will shatter your greatest champions face to face. I no longer fear either the dark or the light. I am not a cutpurse anymore dear Patch; I'm something new.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey call me devastation.<br/>\n<br/>\nDeath follows his path wherever he strides. All but the most wary and hardy fall before his might. Cunning and adept at fighting, it is he who uses the kukri with devastating effect, and inflicts tremendous pain unto his unwary victims.<br/>\n<br/>\nHail the Devastating Rogue. Unique, powerful, deadly. The rogue who specializes in raw power rather than in dexterity. This build makes an especially deadly warrior, and virtually anyone caught off-guard is almost certainly assured death. With a maximum of 84d6 sneak attack, high melee damage, and very likely devastating critical hits in his first attack maneuver, he is no laughing matter.

This is because of the 3 phases of combat per round of the NWN game engine, where attacks are divided into 3 parts, such that this character would get 3 attacks in the first phase (1st second), 2 attacks in the second phase (3rd second) and 2 attacks in the final phase (5th second).<br/>\n<br/>\nImagine the surprised look on your opponent's face when he sees many floating texts above his character, such as 'Sneak Attack,\" \"Critical Hit,\" and the dreaded \"Devastating Critical.\" Envision his extreme shock as his character suddenly drops dead!<br/>\n<br/>\nMagical items and scrolls are great helpers, since he has a modified Use Magic Device check of 25, enabling him to use all magical items worth 100,000gp and below. Scrolls of Haste and Potions of Speed will prove especially invaluable to him, apart from various other scrolls, wands, and class-exclusive magical items, such as Boots of the Sun Soul, Sequencer Robes, and perhaps Monk robes, which should be easily obtainable for an epic character.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis character works well alone, but even better if he is in the company of melee warriors, as he will be able to fully show his destructive capabilities when flanking opponents with his sneak attacks. Also, in attempt to make up for his lack of Will and Fortitude, he has 20 Spellcraft ranks, which means he gets a +4 bonus to all saving throws against spellcasting.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, he does have his shortcomings as well, but nothing that magical equipment can't handle.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlternatively, this build could be used with scimitars or rapiers instead, and replacing the Exotic Weapon Proficiency with Knockdown. At a slight cost of attack, the Knockdown feat is gained. However, this is not recommended.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote: There are both 20th and 40th level bic character files, but the 20th level character is not recommended for use as his powers are yet to be developed.<br/>\n<br/>\nDevastating Rogue Advantages<br/>\nDecent modified attack, deadly Sneak attacks, high regular melee damage, high critical threat (30% chance, 45% chance if keen), high critical damage, and Devastating Critical potential all in one.<br/>\nExcellent stealth and detection.<br/>\nCrippling Strike is easily inflicted<br/>\nIs a decent fighter<br/>\nDecent Reflex save<br/>\n<br/>\nDevastating Rogue Disadvantages<br/>\nRelatively low hit points (should obtain constitution-improving items such as Boots of Striding)<br/>\nRelatively low AC for a rogue (should obtain Ring of Protection and Amulet of Natural Armor)<br/>\nMediocre Fortitude<br/>\nLow Will save<br/>\n<br/>\nCombat Tips<br/>\nBuff up with Keen Edge Scroll and Potion of Speed (or acquire items which provide Haste, and Magical kukris with the Keen property)<br/>\nEnter stealth mode<br/>\nSneak up on an opponent<br/>\nCarve him like a Halloween pumpkin<br/>\nIf target miraculously survives, repeat as necessary =)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I do embrace the idea of a strength based, low intelligent ruffian, a deadly thug and lethal flanker.<br/>\nTherefore, I had a look at this legacy build to see if there was something to learn from it.<br/>\nThe Sneak attacks of this build are impressive with 36 rogue levels and ISA X giving a SA bonus of 28d6!<br/>\nThere is also the strength based damage bonus to every hit.<br/>\nDevastating critical with a DC of 39 and a threat range of 15-20 looks impressive.<br/>\nHowever, there are some glaring weaknesses here too. The AB is too low with +36. The saves are low, and there is a 20% xp penalty during most of the career. There is WS, but no EWS, giving up +4 damage on every hit.<br/>\nSo I revamped the Devastating rogue and gave it much better AB, better saves, better damage per hit, added knockdown so you can land SA in toe to toe combat, improved the Dev crit DC, removed the xp penalty and added some hitpoints.<br/>\nI took less rogue and had to cut down on the ISA feats to be able to do this. That means less skill points and less d6 in the Sneak damage. Less d6 SA may seem to defeat the purpose of the build, but the resulting build deals much more damage over all. The hit rate will be much higher with the improved AB. Each hit deals more regular damage with higher strength and EWS. You are able to land SA more often with better AB and Knockdown available.<br/>\nYou will also land critical hits more often now and the Dev crit DC is better, so you will \"one-hit-kill\" more often.<br/>\nThe OP recommends playing the character in Studded leather. You can use Full plate if you want, and even Full plate and Tower if you need the AC. When you want to use stealth, drink some Cat\u2019s, wear some dexterity gear and downgrade the armor to Chain shirt/Scale mail or light armor.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Rogue(24), Fighter(6), Champion of Torm(10), Human\n\nDEX: 15\nWIS: 8\nCHA: 8\n01: Rogue(1): Power Attack, Cleave\n03: Rogue(2): Weapon Focus: Kukri, {Evasion}\n05: Fighter(3)\n07: Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}\n09: Champion of Torm(1): Blind Fight\n11: Champion of Torm(3): {Smite Evil}\n13: Rogue(6)\n15: Rogue(7): Iron Will\n17: Rogue(9)\n19: Rogue(11)\n21: Champion of Torm(5): Epic Weapon Focus: Kukri\n23: Rogue(13): Slippery Mind\n25: Champion of Torm(8): Devastating Critical: Kukri\n27: Champion of Torm(10): Great Strength II, Epic Weapon Specialization: Kukri, (STR=26)\n29: Rogue(15)\n31: Fighter(5)\n33: Rogue(18): Great Strength IV, (STR=30)\n35: Rogue(20)\n37: Rogue(22)\n39: Fighter(6): Great Strength VI, Epic Prowess, (STR=33)\n\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 28/22/30\nBAB: 27\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 20/30\nXP penalty: 0%\nDiscipline 42(54), Hide 43(45), Move Silently 43(45), Search 21(21), Spellcraft 10(10), Spot 43(42), Tumble 40(42), UMD 36(35), remaining skillpoints 3\n01: Hide(4), Move Silently(4), Search(4), Spot(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(12), \n03: Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Search(2), Spot(2), Tumble(2), UMD(2), Save(7), \n05: Discipline(1), Save(10), \n07: Hide(4), Move Silently(4), Search(4), Spot(4), Tumble(4), Save(1), \n09: Discipline(3), Spot(1), Save(4), \n11: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(6), \n13: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), UMD(5), Save(1), \n15: Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Search(4), Spot(1), \n17: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(5), Save(4), \n19: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), Save(10), \n21: Discipline(7), Spot(1), Save(6), \n23: Hide(3), Move Silently(3), Spot(1), Tumble(5), Save(4), \n25: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(5), \n27: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(7), \n29: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(1), UMD(5), Save(1), \n31: Discipline(4), Save(1), \n33: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spot(2), UMD(5), \n35: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spellcraft(5), Spot(1), Save(2), \n37: Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Spellcraft(5), Tumble(5), \n39: Discipline(8), </details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

This one can use stealth for tactical purposes and stand and fight like a Fighter. Flanking and KD will give opportunities for Sneak attacks, and the base damage is pretty good. So there is not much need for HIPS for crowd control and you don't depend on making repeated SA from stealth.<br/>\nAnother point is that the original is a straight up Fighter/Rogue with a limited number of tactics available, and I wanted to create a character that can do the same things, only better.\u00a0<br/>\nI would normally also add lock picking and trap skills to a rogue build, and I often use SD too. But that would be a less brutal and more versatile build type with more feats, higher intelligence and more skills.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
