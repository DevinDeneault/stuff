      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I would guess that the benefit with more classes in a build for the most part is with \"front loaded\" classes where you can add a level or two for some cheese or to qualify for a prestigue class that would not be possible otherwise with a given set of only 3 classes. <br/>\nMany classes still benefit from a high number of levels, such as casters, rangers, AAs, assassins etc.<br/>\nThere is also the question of more than 40% xp penalty that now really can slow down the character progression.<br/>\nIt still remains to be seen how many PWs that choose to expand beyond 3 classes. If they do, we will face a new type of build requests.<br/>\nI think we should start to explore the possibilities.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
