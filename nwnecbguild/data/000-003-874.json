To rectify that, I thought of making a two-man army for a cooperative playthrough, trying to cover as many bases as possible (the typical fighter/rogue/wizard/cleric quartet with melee/ranged attacks). I am a novice builder so feedback will be much appreciated; I took inspiration from the builds linked in the header:<br/>\n<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary><table

Epic Dodge is even worth anything from sneak attack range, and they still need +Attack bows +Damage arrows to overcome DR.<br/>\nBoth characters also have low Concentration and no Persuade skill for NPC dialogue (though this may be a minor concern if you can survive the ensuing fights), and their spell DC + caster level are both low.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Kudos!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I might mention a couple of things...<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know if you're aware of this or not, but you'll be finishing HotU at around level 27-8, so, unless you're thinking of taking the builds forward somewhere else, you'll want to get what you can from those levels. Unfortunately, unless we do some restructuring, you won't be Dev Critting or Epic Dodging during the campaigns. If you'd prefer to sacrifice those elements, other options are available.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfraid I'm no expert on several elements of these 2 builds, but one thing I do know about Cleric is that you actually want to have a maximum pre-epic BAB of 15. Yes, I know, that's only 3 attacks per round. However, Divine Power gives you an extra attack per round at full AB, so you end up with 4 attacks and 2 of them are at full AB, which is better than a pure Fighter-type. Thus, you might think about swapping either Cleric 12 or CoT 4 for Bard 5.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've got to be somewhere else right now, but I'll come back to you, if that's okay.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Welcome mf_hansen!<br/>\nStagmeister already pointed out that HotU ends at level 27 or 28, and unless you plan on taking the builds elsewhere, you should plan the builds for lvl 28.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you try to do here is taking the good old\u00a0fighter/rogue/wizard/cleric quartet and melt it all together into two character builds.<br/>\nWhen I see Cleric 20, Wizard 20 and AA 7 in level 40 builds, I think there should have been more.<br/>\nRogue 13 and Bard 16 are often just right.<br/>\nCoT 4 is a filler for a couple of extra feats, slightly better saves and a little extra BAB.<br/>\nMy benevolent feedback is that I think you try to cram too much into the builds. It makes them weaker and makes them mature very late - too late for a lvl 28 campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo how to build a duo?<br/>\nYou want magic, healing, melee, ranged attacks and rogue skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou will be able to play the game without investing anything in healing: No class spells, no heal skills, no whatsoever. There are plenty of heal kits to cure poison and disease. There are potions for almost every healing spell. And there are restoration and antidote potions. There are also scrolls of all levels of restoration, raise dead and resurrection. And there are scrolls that cure other ailments and curses.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd regardless I think one of your characters should be a cleric. Clerics have great melee prowess, and have spells that in most cases make them better warriors than the warrior classes. They are also very strong against undead. Cleric spells give the protections you need, and you can attack undead with your healing spells! The Mass heal spell works as an area of attack spell, far better than Turn undead.<br/>\nYou may sprinkle the build slightly with bard for skill dumps, or with fighter or CoT for extra feats. But building up Cleric quickly is the most important. I would take no less than 24 cleric levels in a level 28 build made for this purpose. Then you get a very powerful \"spell-sword\".<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other build should be a rogue and I would focus on the rogue class early on to get many skill points and be able to build up a little SA damage and the essential rogue skills and social skills. Here you have greater freedom with multiclassing.<br/>\nIf you want an archer, give AA priority and take no more than 2 levels of wizard .The second wizard level is at full BAB and Rogue 8/ Wizard 2/AA 10 has BAB 17 whereas Rogue 9/ Wizard 1/ AA 10 only has BAB 16! I would start with Rogue 7/ Wizard 2 before taking AA and take the 8th rogue level later for a skill dump. In epic levels I would take a couple of rogue levels more for skill dumps. There is also the option to aim at rogue 13 and ED at level 27.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rogue can use scrolls and other caster items with the UMD skill. If you have a level of wizard, you have free access to all wizard restricted scrolls and items. But the most powerfull magic user in this duo will be the cleric above!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">And if you were prepared to go with Mick's advice about the Cleric you wouldn't need to worry about all the feats you need for Dev Crit, freeing up several feats (at least Power Attack, Cleave and Great Cleave, but possibly also Martial Weapon Prof and Toughness - but I'll come to Toughness later). This would help in getting Blind Fight and Divine Might. So, remaining as human, and taking 17 or 18 levels of Cleric pre-epic you'd still have one spare feat as a minimum.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would also give you more freedom with your stats. You wouldn't need to go for so much Str (if it helps, Divine Power also raises your Str to 18 if it's below that), and, if you only take a few levels of Bard, you could also dump Cha (down to 8 if you took Cleric at level 1, 11 if not). This would enable you to really bump Wis, as well as getting your Con more comfortable - which is where my earlier line about maybe losing Toughness comes in. Maybe something like STR 12, DEX 12, CON 14, WIS 16 (22 or 23), INT 14, CHA 8.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a few thoughts...<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Yeah I definitely hadn't thought about the soft level 28 cap; the Sands of Fate modules afterward would be a neat addition indeed (not on Steam workshop yet but NWvault never fails).

That one in particular is now Half-Orc and very much a work-in-progress build, more to see if it was possible than anything useful; hoping to have version 3 ready in the weekend :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary><table class=\"post_content_table\"><tbody><tr><td>Critty Swordsman v2</td>\n<td><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/elven-guardian-rogue-17-wizard-1-arcane-archer-22-t2355003.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dodgy Marksman v2</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Cleric(24), Fighter(4), Half-Orc<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 20 (26)<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 12<br/>\nWIS: 16 (19)<br/>\nINT: 6<br/>\nCHA: 6<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Cleric(1): Power Attack, Domain Plant, Domain Strength<br/>\n02: Cleric(2)<br/>\n03: Cleric(3): Cleave<br/>\n04: Cleric(4): STR+1<br/>\n05: Cleric(5)<br/>\n06: Cleric(6): Knockdown<br/>\n07: Cleric(7)<br/>\n08: Cleric(8): STR+1<br/>\n09: Cleric(9): Weapon Proficiency Martial<br/>\n10: Cleric(10)<br/>\n11: Cleric(11)<br/>\n12: Cleric(12): WIS+1, Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br/>\n13: Cleric(13)<br/>\n14: Cleric(14)<br/>\n15: Cleric(15): Great Cleave<br/>\n16: Cleric(16): WIS+1<br/>\n17: Cleric(17)<br/>\n18: Cleric(18): Improved Critical: Scimitar<br/>\n19: Cleric(19)<br/>\n20: Cleric(20): STR+1<br/>\n21: Cleric(21): Great Strength I<br/>\n22: Cleric(22)<br/>\n23: Cleric(23): Great Wisdom I<br/>\n24: Fighter(1): STR+1, OverCrit: Scimitar, DevCrit: Scimitar<br/>\n25: Fighter(2): Epic Weapon Focus: Scimitar<br/>\n26: Fighter(3)<br/>\n27: Fighter(4): EpicWpnSpec: Scimitar, WpnSpec: Scimitar<br/>\n28: Cleric(24): STR+1<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 260<br/>\nSkillpoints: 31<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 17/20/9<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: <br/>\nBAB: 19<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 30 (melee), 18 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 9/20<br/>\nSpell Casting: Cleric(9)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nremaining skillpoints 31<br/>\n<br/>\n20% multiclass penalty from level 24</td>\n<td>Wizard(2), Rogue(13), Arcane Archer(13), Elf<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 12<br/>\nDEX: 18 (26)<br/>\nCON: 12<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 16<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Rogue(1): Point Blank Shot<br/>\n02: Rogue(2)<br/>\n03: Rogue(3): Weapon Finesse<br/>\n04: Rogue(4): DEX+1<br/>\n05: Rogue(5)<br/>\n06: Rogue(6): Rapid Shot<br/>\n07: Rogue(7)<br/>\n08: Rogue(8): DEX+1<br/>\n09: Wizard(1): Weapon Focus: Longbow<br/>\n10: Arcane Archer(1)<br/>\n11: Arcane Archer(2)<br/>\n12: Arcane Archer(3): DEX+1, Called Shot<br/>\n13: Arcane Archer(4)<br/>\n14: Arcane Archer(5)<br/>\n15: Arcane Archer(6): Blind Fight<br/>\n16: Arcane Archer(7): DEX+1<br/>\n17: Arcane Archer(8)<br/>\n18: Arcane Archer(9): Improved Critical: Longbow<br/>\n19: Arcane Archer(10)<br/>\n20: Wizard(2): DEX+1<br/>\n21: Rogue(9): Armor Skin<br/>\n22: Rogue(10): Improved Evasion<br/>\n23: Arcane Archer(11)<br/>\n24: Rogue(11): DEX+1, Great Dexterity I<br/>\n25: Arcane Archer(12)<br/>\n26: Rogue(12)<br/>\n27: Rogue(13): Epic Dodge, Defensive Roll<br/>\n28: Arcane Archer(13): DEX+1<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 218<br/>\nSkillpoints: 277<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 14/11/25<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +5, Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +2<br/>\nBAB: 21<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 29 (melee), 37 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 26/30<br/>\nSpell Casting: Wizard(1)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nDisable Trap 30(35), Hide 31(39), Listen 31(32),<br/>\nMove Silently 31(39), Open Lock 12(20), Search 30(35), Set Trap 30(40),<br/>\nSpellcraft 22(25), Tumble 30(38), UMD 30(29)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table></details>\n<br/>\nHah, look at that stupid thing; armor class 20 on a melee character! Also no Improved Knockdown and limited hitpoints; Discipline will also be delayed until epic levels. WIP indeed :)<br/>\nI would probably replace swordsman EWS fighter XP penalty with CoT for Extend Spell and longer Divine Power buffs, but I'll take another look at the Cleric tips from you all tomorrow.<br/>\nI wonder if you can cheat by only having 18 wisdom and using items to reach level 9 spells; divine spells are learnt in advance, but lacking base 19 wisdom likely prevents prep/casting.<br/>\nPerhaps for the marksman I should move Wizard 2 earlier for Rogue 8 skilldump later as Mick suggested; losing a few spell saves is surely much better than lacking Rogue skills in HotU!<br/>\nThanks again for the tips, and don't hesitate to point out if there are some easy tweaks for the builds above I might take into account tomorrow, beyond the good advice I've seen already!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
