Am in Aielund now, with Empyre's Monk/Fighter/Shadow-Dancer, but thought I'd also take a trip there with a build I'm familiar with - namely my little elven tank from the 'Non-shooty, non-magicky elves' thread. Now, I've had a look at that build and, of course, it has Dev Crit. So, I thought, minor alterations only...Naive. Easy enough pre-epic - just swap Great Cleave for Toughness. However, in epic I seem to have 2 Fighter bonus feats that I don't know what to do with! I've already moved EWF and EWS (levels 22 and 29 respectively) to earlier in the build, ditto Armor Skin and Epic Prowess (levels 33 and 38). This also means that I've put Great Strength I into the vacant level 21 slot - which means I can put another Great Strength (VII) into level 39. And now I'm left with an odd number in STR (41), which seems a waste, and a redundant bonus feat for Fighter 16.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, I'm thinking of dropping Fighter down to 14 and taking either 2 more levels of Bard (making it 16) - for the additional skill points, or RDD (making it 12) - for the HPs. What do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm aware that I'm tinkering with a phenomenal build, and moaning that I've got too many feats to play with, which seems to be an insane complaint, but your sage counsel would be appreciated. (You see what happens when I get interested again! <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" />)<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks in advance!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It's a build I love, and with which I first learned how to play properly (for want of a better word). Thus, I thought: \"scary new game, I'd like someone familiar to play with\".

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks, Hip. For a clown, even I can see the logic of your guidance re the postings/links. Makes sense - let's see if I can break it! And big hands up for naming the respective URLs!<br/>\n<br/>\n I guess you've now seen the build(s). Simply put, I've taken Empyre's pre-epic build as is (using Valerfor's skills split, though we're ignoring skills for now, if I understand your post correctly), with the sole exception of swapping out Great Cleave at level 18 for Toughness (GC was only there, I suspect, in order to pursue a Dev Crit build), thereby granting extra HPs, hoorah!<br/>\n<br/>\n My issue comes in Epic, for which I used Valerfor's variant (it's all sounding terribly \"physics\", isn't it?). Clearly, OW Crit and Dev Crit are non-starters, so I popped my first Great Strength in at L21, and EWF at L22 (I took handaxe rather than shortsword as my preferred weapon, 'cos, well...). I then hiked EWS to L29 (still trying to keep the same level progession as the original), Armor Skin to L33 (Fighter 12 BF), and Epic Prowess to L38 (Fighter 14 BF). Great Strengths (II - VI) took all my 'natural' feats up to L36. Essentially, I'm asking for help at levels 39 and 40, where, if I stay with current progression, I take Fighter 15 (with a 'natural' feat) and 16 (with a bonus feat). I <em>could</em> take an extra Great Strength at L39, but it just means I could carry more stuff, which I would hope shouldn't be a problem at that stage. Equally, the rest of the Fighter class bonuses in Epic are of no real use (back in the day, I'd have leapt at Improved Initiative, but times change...). So I thought, \"how about dropping the last two Fighter levels for either two more levels of Bard - which I only use for singing purposes (I know, my bad, but I'll start looking at spellcasting once I've 'mastered' the mundane), or RDD - which will keep my hit points higher?\" That was all this was meant to be!<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, I'm aware I haven't posted where I'm at, but I'm trying to describe it, because I want to keep as close to the original(s) as I can. It's a build (builds?) I adore, and in whose skin I feel very comfortable, which is no bad thing when one goes somewhere new.<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and yes, I get what you say about 'quick' - maybe I should have said 'simple'! <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

When all those that have major impact have already been slotted, that's where Toughness comes in. I would take IKD over Toughness any day of the week without even thinking about it.\u00a0 Let's see, at that point you would have struggled mightily along without those precious 17 HPs and then at 18 all of a sudden become empowered to brave savage tests?\u00a0 Nah.\u00a0 All Toughness does is save a healing round once in a blue moon.\u00a0 Even Called arm shots would serve this toon better, but still IKD would be my feat of choice.<br/>\n<br/>\n Another strange thing about this is:\u00a0 Couldn't you sacrifice 1AB to gain access to Improved Invisibility, Keen Edge and +4 Magic Weapon?\u00a0 Perhaps the environment is flushed with scrolls?\u00a0 Unless these modules place keen prop indiscriminately on weaponry, that spell is worth its weight in gold.\u00a0\u00a0 Dunno.\u00a0 All those bard levels with almost no casting ability is pretty odd.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Many thanks, Hip.<br/>\n<br/>\n I probably ought to clarify a couple of things about the build. I specifically requested a non-magic-using elf - and even had to have bard song and use of armour explained to me. I was very much a newbie to NwN, and my only experience of Bard was in a Baldur's Gate/Icewind Dale context, which would have been a ludicrous choice for solo-ing the OC. This way, Empyre got me thinking about playing in a different way, which was invaluable. Equally, I was very dismissive of the knockdowns - and they do seem somewhat redundant in the OC. However, one of the reasons for my moving into a different story (Aielund, in this case) was to actually make use of these feats, as everyone else had told me how splendid they are. It does, therefore make sense to have IKD in the build, as you suggest, and so Toughness gets binned in its favour.<br/>\n<br/>\n It may well be that the build could be maxed in different ways, and I have no idea what sort of items and goodies await, but I like him, and I wanted someone I knew how to play to explore this new environment.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Most times I will tweak the build slightly according to what I've read in the discussions, other times not if my specific application has little in common with those other builds.\u00a0 Your own play-style should be the final deciding factor.\u00a0 Whatever is most comfortable to play will always be the best recipe.<br/>\n<br/>\n BUT---&gt; Do not underestimate the hi-level Neverwinter Bard.\u00a0 It's not just a skill dump class.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n A Bard can become a dominant choice for melee especially when synergized with another CHA-benefited class like CoT or cleric.\u00a0 There was a mindful decision devising the AD&amp;D ruleset for making Bards non-lawful else the Bard/Paladin combo would be way too over-powering (but don't dismiss Bard/BG as a possibility).\u00a0 A long-duration (i.e. Lingering Song/Lasting Inspiration 5+ hrs ) buff and curse that cannot be dispelled even by a Level 40 mage casting a Mord is pretty awesome.\u00a0 How handy would a +15 boost to Discipline/Concentration/Hide/Heal/Taunt... etc. be during combat while reducing your opponents' skills an equal portion not to mention an equally destructive effect on their AC, AB and damage?\u00a0 Just nasty IMO. How about a shapechanged Iron Golem singing and cursing while smashing through mobs of gawking enemies?\u00a0 The ultimate partymate and solo artist both in one package.\u00a0 The NWN Bard is not the gimped Baldur's Gate crossbowman eradicating fear with showtunes!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
