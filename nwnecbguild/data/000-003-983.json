      "content": "<div>Hello all<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my second attempt at this Character build.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first character I attempted was a posted back in December of 2017. In that post I had used incorrect formatting for the character, and it was very hard to read. So I decided to make a new post in hopes that the format is correct. (please feel free to remove the old post)<br/>\n<br/>\nI did take the suggestions that were given and tried to make this character better. I tried to build it so it would be playable from levels 1-40.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also tried to build this toon with the ability to go into low level modules. ie. if the module automatically makes this toon level 12 instead of 40 - you can still be a decent support toon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 26 levels of Bard for both the undispellable buffs and the extra bonus feat from 26th level\u00a0 -This toon also has with a very strong curse and buff song.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 10 levels of Rogue are for the bonus Rogue feat and the ability to pick locks and set and remove traps.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 4 levels of Blackguard are for the platemail - scimitar - and the buff to savings throws from the high charisma. The extra stuff that comes with the Blackguard class are bonus.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI wanted to be able to solo modules if I wanted to (hoping this toon can do it)<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sure that there are many ways to make this toon much better. Please make any and all suggestions as you see fit.<br/>\n<br/>\n(I edited the post to reflect Still Spell in the build instead of Silent Spell per Mick Dagger)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBard(26),

      "content": "<div><blockquote><div><cite>wongdongfu wrote:</cite>\nI am sure that there are many ways to make this toon much better. Please make any and all suggestions as you see fit.\n</div></blockquote>\nThis is already a strong build. What remains now are\u00a0details:<br/>\n<br/>\nYou have a strength based character in full plate and you want to cast spells. You have taken the silent spell feat. I am sure that you rather want the still spell feat.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou seem a bit uncertain about the trap skills and how many ranks to take.<br/>\nThe Set trap DC for deadly fire- or electrical traps is 35. Set trap is a \"Take 20\" skill so unless you want to set traps in combat you only need 15 modified ranks to set them. If you want to set deadly gas traps, the DC is 45 and you want 25 modified ranks. For epic traps the Set trap DC is 65, so you will need 45 modified ranks to set those.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo detect all deadly traps, the DC is 22 (+ the set trap skill of the trapper). The most difficult vanilla deadly traps have the 22 DC. In PvP the set trap skill of your opponent becomes important. Sometimes\u00a0 mod designers use traps with a custom DC. But for most PvM play, a DC of 22 is an all right target for your search skill. Search is not a \"Take 20\" skill, so you always roll a die and add your skill bonus. A modified search skill of 21 will always detect a deadly trap. The epic traps have a Detect DC of 43 (+ the set trap skill of the trapper). Here 42 modified ranks will always succeed with vanilla traps in PvM.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo disarm all deadly traps the DC is 36 (+ the set trap skill of the trapper). Disable trap is a \"Take 20\" skill, so you need 16 modified ranks to disarm all deadly vanilla traps in PvM. (Assessing a trap to determine its difficulty modifies the DC by -7. Flagging a trap to make it visible to the rest of the party modifies the DC by -5. Disarming a trap uses the base DC. Recovering a trap modifies the DC by +10.)<br/>\nThe\u00a0 disarm DC\u00a0for epic traps is 58 (+ the set trap skill of the trapper). 38 modified ranks is a target here for Vanilla epic traps in PvM.</div>",

      "content": "<div>I have a couple of suggestions for improved AB during pre epic play.<br/>\n<br/>\nA) I would start with Str 16 and Cha 15. The cost is the same but your AB will be higher from the start, and you don't need more Cha that early.<br/>\n<br/>\nB) You take 1: Rogue (1)\u00a0and 2: Bard (1). I understand why you do that skill-wise. But beware that both classes have +0 BAB at Level 1. Those 3/4 classes have +0 BAB at class Level 1, 5, 9 etc. If you\u00a0take +0 BAB levels earlier than needed, your AB becomes temporarily lower than what it has to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit:\u00a0On B): I have to admit that I do this myself from time to time, like in the Kama-Shinobi build where I take Monk 6/ Assassin 1/ SD 1 (Four +0 BAB Levels in the first 8 Levels). But when I do it, I do it for a reason, eg. to get an early HIPS, for\u00a0other desired class feats or\u00a0for a much needed skill-dump etc. The end result (final BAB)\u00a0is not affected by this, but levelling can be harder when you take the +0 BAB class levels\u00a0earlier than needed. So make sure that the benefit outweights the cost.</div>",

You can also add feats that modifies skills to that list, eg. the skill focus feats.<br/>\nThere is a +50 cap to the skill bonus from buffs and items. That goes for any skill.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as I know there is no standard open lock DC. It is all up to the module designer.<br/>\nIt is different with traps, since the different types\u00a0and\u00a0tiers of vanilla traps have set DCs to set-, detect- and disarm trap.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe skill levels you\u00a0estimate for epic traps\u00a0are correct (well almost).<br/>\nThe detect DC is 43. For that you will need 42 modified Search ranks if you want to make sure you detect the trap even when you roll a 1.<br/>\nThe set and disarm DCs are also correct as long as you are in a \"take 20\" situation<br/>\nIf there are custom traps, they can be harder, like Empyre told you. And in PvP against a trapper with a high Set trap skill, traps can be impossible to detect and disarm.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you play as a bard, you also have the option to cast the spell Find traps. In many mods you can even buy wands that can cast that spell.</div>",

      "content": "<div>Hey man! I do like this build. It seems very playable, even though it starts with low AB. It quickly catches up. I'm not sure if you can take Still Spell on a Rogue level at 9, as it's most likely not a class feat, but all you'd need to do is swap Bard with Rogue at 9. Take Rogue either at 10 or at 8, matters not. I'd also advocate for swapping up Blind Fight and KD, since you need AB to use KD effectively and you take 2 +0 BAB classes at levels 1 and 2. Then, in Epic levels, I'd consider taking Bard 24 ASAP for indispellability. For some reason there, you stop at 23 and start investing in Rogue. Surely the Rogue investment can wait one more level for you to be undispellable. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne more thing I would do myself, but that I think is more due to personal preference than making the build actually stronger is go for Divine Shield as well as Divine Might. +10 AC with capped CHA is not something to be discarded so easily. You'd need to drop Still Spell and rework the order of feats so you can take Divine Might with BG 3 and Divine Shield 3 levels later with BG 4. You can do that by bringing Blind Fight earlier and re-arranging your BG levels so that BG 1 is taken at 12, BG 3 at 15 and BG 4 at 18, taking WF at 12, Might at 15 and Shield at 18.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, it seems like a good well-rounded toon to play. If you're going for more cheesiness, you could consider Crippling Strike instead of Improved Evasion as your Rogue bonus feat. Improved Evasion only helps if you FAIL the save, it does nothing different from Evasion if you succeed. I don't think you'll be failing that many saves with Dark Blessing and CHA gear.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>",

(Removed Still Spell)<br/>\nMoved Bard and Rogue levels around to get to Bard 24 for indispellability as soon as feasibly possible.<br/>\nMoved around the Blind Fight and Knockdown Feats.<br/>\nReworked all the skill points so they seem to make a little more sense (I still suck at this building a toon thing)<br/>\nRemoved Improved Evasion for Crippling Strike<br/>\nHoping gear and Bard Song will put this toon over the edge whenever a trap needs set / removed and a lock needs picked. This toon can also use the Knock spell as a wand / scroll and the find traps spell if needed.<br/>\nI am going to run this toon through the OC over the next few days and see how he does as a leveling toon.<br/>\nThank you all for the help!<br/>\n<br/>\nHere we go\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nBard(26), Rogue(10), Blackguard(4), Human<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 16 (26)<br/>\nDEX: 8<br/>\nCON: 14<br/>\nWIS:
