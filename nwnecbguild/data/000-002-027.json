      "content": "<div>Just a personal opinion here, but I'd be tempted to take EWS at level 21 as a general feat, regain the Dex point at level 40 instead of Wis (the Will save's sucky anyway - 17 - so losing 1 more will make no real difference), which leaves a spare WM bonus feat at level 39 that can be used for either Epic Prowess or Armour Skin.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, 43 (42) in UMD is redundant: at most it should be 41 (40), giving you a whole 2 skill points to play with! Actually, if you take 4 points from Open Locks as well, then add the 6 to Disable Trap you get 37 (38), giving you full disarm epic traps. That said, I'm not terribly sure what Discipline brings to the build, but I'm probably missing something.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Just trying to prove that I do read this stuff!)</div>",

Don't get me wrong, I do like what you're doing there, but the whiff of burning martyr is a tad acrid.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd no, no one said all builds will be \"saddled\" on you. However, these are old builds, many constructed before the 1.69 patch came out, and all of them before this Guild existed. While caveat emptor applies here, when members have questions about any builds from the old site, we have always helped resolve those issues.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo thanks for the negativity, but it might be worth looking at who's casting the first stone.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and this is me locking this topic.
