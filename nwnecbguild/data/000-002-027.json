Presumably if the module/ PW doesn't enable the player to effect &lt;8 classes, or chooses to allow only partial implementation, that will have an impact.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom a building perspective, obviously this could open up many more possibilities (assuming racial/ alignment restrictions still apply), but there are many things we'd need to know more about before boldly setting forth - one that immediately leaps to mind is the implication for xp and penalties thereto, because if the current rules still apply a player could end up with a 100% xp penalty.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I'm guessing that, as taking more classes perforce means fewer levels for the primary class, we'll have to be careful that doesn't end up weakening builds (particularly caster-clerics and arcanists). How useful would a 5/5/5/5/5/5/5/5 build actually be? So we'll need to find some way of making the best of various combos rather than going down a middle-of-the-road answer. There's no point sticking more classes in if their impact is meh, after all. And I suppose we'll only find our way through this by practicing.<br/>\n<br/>\nEqually, if everything becomes an uber-build (assuming enemy NPCs will also be making use of the changes), things are gonna become pretty stagnant pretty quick.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it seems to be a hurry up and wait scenario atm.

With the current rules you can end up with a negative xp per kill if you have enough non favored base classes.<br/>\nBuilds with front loaded classes may benefit from the change, but not necessarily builds focusing on classes that get better with levels, so there is a balance here somewhere.<br/>\nAs for balance, if this change allows for more powerful builds, it is not far fetched to assume that challenges on PWs and new modules will be tougher too.<br/>\nThat being said, I welcome the opportunity for renewed creativity that these changes spark.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

In your absence, some smart-alec has decided that building with 3 classes wasn't nearly enough, and come up with a patch that can provide up to 8. Webby has kindly linked us to it earlier in this thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe're currently working through both what works and what doesn't, as well as doing a little site reconstruction, so stay tuned. Thus far, only Yunim has paddled in these waters and been prepared to share the results (other than Web's earlier Dwarf Monster in this thread).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd next time you go on a term-time vacation, I expect a note from your parents!<br/>\n<br/>\nGood to see you again.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

RL, and Tapatalk having done some despicable things to me at least, have kept me away from full attention. ATM, treat things as usual - things can always be moved once I'm more settled.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot much of an answer, but hope it will do for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
