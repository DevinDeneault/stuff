There is also a useful ranged AB 38 attack for +12 damage dart throwing if this is desired.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThere can be extra AB from being outdoors (+2), flanking with your summons/companion (+2), making your opponent flatfooted (losing Dex, Dodge and Tumble AC -&gt; this will improve at higher levels, if successful), plus a Druid's Str and Wis tends to be capped fairly easily. Monk UBAB is also more forgiving, with a 3 AB reduction with subsequent attacks compared with the standard 5 AB reduction.<br/>\n<br/>\nShifted forms are powerful but not mandatory for combat, the only more powerful form than melee form hopefully being Dragon Shape, which is 3x/day and cannot fit through standard doors, also is not knockdown immune without discipline or Rogue/UMD (Thieves Hood) in the build, so in a rest-restricted environment, it saves on usage of this ability. Interestingly the BAB 27 with Epic Prowess will mean the Dragon Shape will have a higher AB than most Druid's DS forms, usually having a BAB of 25-26.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoV DC = Reflex 41 or stun<br/>\nStonehold DC = Will 38 or paralysis<br/>\nGrease DC = Reflex 33 or knockdown<br/>\n<br/>\nI chose half-orc here because I wanted as much AB as I could while preserving a high Wis score, human gets a lot more skill points, no exp penalties (half-orc has 20% exp penalties from level 22 onwards) and a bonus pre-epic feat at the cost of 2 str and 1 AB and darkvision. I think the build can manage without the skill points, it has druid spell casting, a useful melee and ranged attack, great saves, evasion, true seeing. Maybe human is stronger but for now I am keen to let the half-orc have his/her day for once. Discipline is missed though, and a human could get that skill. I put a value point in set trap because druids get \"One with the Land\" which adds +4 to set trap. Search is in the build for hidden doors. Playtested to level 5 so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe class split Druid 28 / CoT 10 / Monk 2 is a famous one, used by Maximillan Kane's <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/champion-of-the-wilderness-druid-28-cot-10-monk-2-t515398.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Champion of the Wilderness</a> written in 2010. There are enough differences with his build to make this one unique and different.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the archives, christian.schnabel's Nature's Spellsword (Druid 24 / Monk 6 / CoT 10) is a strength focused druid spellsword, gets Str 26, mundane AB 38, 460hp and a lot of skill points, Wis 22 with no dragon shape (ie 4 more Str and 1 more AB at the cost of spell casting), so 37 AB isn't too bad considering DC casting is in the build and an 8 higher wisdom score plus the wis AC associated with it.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Druid(28), Champion of Torm(10), Monk(2), Half-Orc\nPvM 1-40, low to mid magic\nSTR: 18 (22)\nCON: 10\nINT: 8\n\n01: Druid(1): Toughness\n03: Druid(3): Weapon Focus: Scimitar\n05: Druid(5)\n07: Druid(7)\n09: Druid(9): Scribe Scroll (or Silent Spell, Improved Critical: Unarmed, Great Fortitude)\n11: Druid(11)\n13: Champion of Torm(1)\n15: Champion of Torm(3): Extend Spell, {Smite Evil}\n17: Champion of Torm(5)\n19: Champion of Torm(7)\n21: Druid(13): Epic Weapon Focus: Kama\n23: Champion of Torm(9)\n25: Druid(14)\n27: Druid(16): Great Wisdom III, (WIS=27)\n29: Druid(18)\n31: Druid(20)\n33: Druid(22): Epic Prowess\n35: Druid(24): Dragon Shape\n37: Monk(2): {Deflect Arrows}\n39: Druid(27): Great Strength II, (STR=21)\n\nSkillpoints: 109\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +3, Fear: +2\nAB (max, naked): 37 (melee), 38 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Druid(9)\n\n\n01: Animal Empathy(1), Concentration(3), Open Lock(1), Search(2), Save(2),\u00a0\n03: Concentration(1), Search(1),\u00a0\n05: Concentration(1), Search(1), Save(1),\u00a0\n07: Concentration(1), Save(5),\u00a0\n09: Concentration(1), Save(9),\u00a0\n11: Concentration(1), Save(13),\u00a0\n13: Save(16),\u00a0\n15: Save(18),\u00a0\n17: Save(20),\u00a0\n19: Save(22),\u00a0\n21: Concentration(4), Save(22),\u00a0\n23: Save(1),\u00a0\n25: Concentration(5),\u00a0\n27: Search(1), Spellcraft(1),\u00a0\n29: Spellcraft(3),\u00a0\n31: Spellcraft(3),\u00a0\n33: Save(3),\u00a0\n35: Save(9),\u00a0\n37: Tumble(15),\u00a0\n39: Concentration(3),\u00a0</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
