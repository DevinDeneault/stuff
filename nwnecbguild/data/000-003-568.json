      "content": "<div>Took a break for a few years (3 or 4 ish).\u00a0 Went to GOG a few days ago and still had my account, so re-downloaded Diamond Edition to replay one of my favorite modules: Ronin Kensai of Kyoto.\u00a0 Now, I want to take a character from Ronin through SOTU/HOTU and into whatever old modules I did to get them to level 40.\u00a0 The hitch is that I want to do a character that is a Monk (for monk gear, free cleave &amp; KD/IKD), Ranger (for free dual wield, FE &amp; ranger search skills in SOU beginning) &amp; Pally (for Holy Avenger in SOU).<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman, of course, but want to avoid experience penalties.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm asking the ECB to give me tips - I'd post a build to tear down, but it's been so long, I'm out of practice.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) PvM\u00a0<br/>\n2) Level 40 (playable 1-40)<br/>\n3) Human<br/>\n4) Monk/Ranger/Paladin<br/>\n5) Dual wield (strength OR dex)<br/>\n6) Range preference: either.\u00a0 This dude's a meleer who'll use ranged weapons to thin out the opposition.<br/>\n7) Weapon preference - He will need Weapon Focus: Exotic to start (to use the Katana in Ronin), and by level 40, will probably dual wield kamas, but any thing with Holy Avenger cast/crafted onto it will work, as well.<br/>\n8) Maximum item enhancement - the later mods that get you into the late 30s/level 40 seem to be +10<br/>\n9) Spellcasting - primarily buffing.<br/>\n10) Custom factors - nope</div>"

      "content": "<div>For that build, I would go Str and Wis - and pick up Zen Archery.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Wisdom has lots of synergy in that build - all three classes use it.\u00a0 Pally and Ranger for spells, and Monk for AC (and with Zen Archery, for Ranged).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou'll want to have some positive Cha (Cha 13+), if possible, for Divine Might/Shield.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe build will be tricky to build without an XP penalty imo - here is an example : <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build287609.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/buil ... 87609.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIn that build, I would shy away from going Dex and Weapon Finese for Wis/Zen Archery.\u00a0 Your Dex bonus to AC is not tied down with Uncanny Dodge, so it may end up being useless for defense, dependingly.\u00a0 Wis AC for Monks never gets compromised (unless wearing Armor, Shield).\u00a0 Also, with more Wis, one will have more spells (though Ranger/Paladin does not have the best of spell lists imo).</div>"
