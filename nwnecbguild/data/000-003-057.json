So as name of this topic says - I'd liek to try out pure class bard for Ravenloft based pw server.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) build should be designed for pwm rather then pvp<br/>\n2) lvl cap on the server is 20lvl<br/>\n3) I prefer to play humans, though subraces are implimented on this server (there are +2 cha subraces like star elf and golden dwarf)<br/>\n4) I would like it to be non multiclassed bard. (all prestige classes require to write application on that server, which may be a bit tedious and difficult, also sever have specific multiclassing rules... for example build 16bard/4 fighter - is not viable combination. You can only go with 15bard/5 figher class, which hurts to bard's song progress)<br/>\n5) character should use one handed weapon and shield combined with heavy armor. Also, all characters get knockdown and disarm feats for free on 2nd lvl.<br/>\n6) may situationally use a bow<br/>\n7) as melee weapon, I'd like to use scimitar<br/>\n8) maximum item enchantment on that server is +3 and it becomes available for a later part of character progression (lvl 14+)<br/>\n9) magic would be used primarily for buffing.<br/>\n10) main modification on the server is increased amount of feats gained during lvl ups. Here's feat progression for bards:<br/>\n<table class=\"post_content_table\"><tbody><tr>[th]Level[/th]\n[th]1[/th]\n2[th]3[/th]\n[th]4[/th]\n[th]5[/th]\n[th]6[/th]\n[th]7[/th]\n[th]8[/th]\n[th]9[/th]\n[th]10[/th]\n[th]11[/th]\n[th]12[/th]\n[th]13[/th]\n[th]14[/th]\n[th]15[/th]\n[th]16[/th]\n[th]17[/th]\n[th]18[/th]\n[th]19[/th]\n[th]20[/th]\n</tr>\n<tr><td>Feats</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\nbesides bonus feats you also get feats on usual lvls like 3,6,9th, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you in advance for your help.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

However, I believe Mick Dagger has done both, so you might want to wait for him to come along.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the meantime, have you seen the self-same Mr Dagger's Guide to building Bards? It's in the Guides sub-forum, and well worth a read.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, good to have you with us!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
