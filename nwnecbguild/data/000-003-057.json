      "content": "<div>Greetings, after fiddling with my last wizard/bard I decided that the combination was a bit to much work to get going and it lacked the staying power a extremely rest restricted server like world of greyhawk needs.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo currently I am trying to figure out a wizard build that can solo the entire server, if its even possible. I know the bosses are nasty but I think it might be feasible with the proper split.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know many of the folks here are World of Greyhawk veterans, and I have no idea the extent of the defensive stats these legendary epic bosses have on the server. Whether I need spell penetration, crit immunity etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWoG is decidedly low magic, with a +6 weapon being a legendary item of great power. Im unsure if items like crit immunity exist, but I do know that haste is a property one can gm buy at higher levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nDevastating critical is around, so I would like to include 10 Pale master if possible to stop that in its tracks. Polymorphs are great but sometimes you just need to stay in caster form. Again I don't know what kind of spell pen is needed against some of the stronger mobs, but it seems that WoG doesn't like to 'cheat' stats. So I think beating toolset sr might be enough.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nExpertise has been fixed to no longer work while casting, so its not as much of an autoinclude.<br/>\n<br/>\nCraft wand is a necessity as it is really good on the server and helps with longevity. I would like to include armor in there, but that would probably mean sacking tumble (or maybe not). Traps don't seem super important as a wizard can rely on the pixie to deal with them or just feeding summons onto them with a wand if I spot them. UMD seems like a necesity, as the server is low magic but has an abundance of varied items for its magic level and that would let me keep my gear diverse.<br/>\n<br/>\nThus I think, assuming that its not to feat intensive, a Wizard/palemaster/bard might be my best option, but its the feat intensity might not make it feasible. Im open to dropping palemaster entirely, and relying on golem form to stop dev criticals but the safety net of palemaster is hard to give up.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo a gnome or dwarf Wizard 26/bard 4/palemaster 10 with spell penetration feats would be capable of beating the sr levels I need, achieve heavy armor, and have discipline/tumble/UMD. I think the AC could become very respectable with this setup and WOG tensers or damage shield/polymorphs would allow it to conserve spells. I don't know if the palemaster crit immunity persists through shapechanges, but if it does death slaad form is an interesting grab. Dwarf could reach a more comfortable early str but gnome has alot of interesting strengths to it. The shield bracers on the server make shields less attractive. I believe Elven chain exists on the server to so that could be a good way to pick up some extra AC with UMD before autostill comes into play.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother interesting split is Wizard 29/bard 3/champion of torm 8<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, this is my ramblings on where I should go with this character. I hope you guys aren't to confused and can help me make something capable of soloing the toughest server I've found.<br/>\n<br/>\nRequirements:<br/>\nCraft Wand<br/>\nHigh AC<br/>\nSaves<br/>\nWizard<br/>\nMust use casting to deal with tough battles.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone has experience with the toughest fights on this server, I know its considered bad form to spoil things but a little nudging in the right direction build wise would be extremely appreciated. I'll start posting builds I come up with when I have them fully mathed out, feedback is always appreciated.</div>"
