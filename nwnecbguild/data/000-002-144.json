      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">It can be helpful in PvM, depending on how the builders make monsters. Creatures that have high Death/Sneak Attack die but no Ass/BG/Rog levels are a lot easier to fight with the changes. This only matters if the builders add Death/Sneak Attack via feats rather than actually giving the monsters class levels in a Death/Sneak Attack class though.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
