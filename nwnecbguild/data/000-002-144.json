It is best to unequip full plate/shields and dismount when attempting trap setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nBest to set traps outside of combat. This includes all party members. Combat can prevent take 20 and interfere with trap setting.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Recommended</strong><br/>\nCraft trap 0-34, modified [5% to 100% crafting success range]. Skill can be used without training.<br/>\n- minor fire/electrical traps 0-19\u00a0<br/>\n- average fire/electrical traps 4-24\u00a0<br/>\n- strong fire/electrical traps 9-29<br/>\n- deadly fire/electrical traps 14-34<br/>\n<br/>\nIf one aims to craft deadly fire/electrical traps, I humbly suggest a minimum craft trap modified score (with items from your environment) of 19-24.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis has 25-50% success rate to craft deadly fire/electrical traps\u00a0to mitigate the 10% risk of component loss on unsuccessful trap creation.<br/>\n<br/>\nHigher is better obviously to save on component loss.<br/>\n<br/>\nCrafting traps can be done quickly, by putting the crafting skills menu on the quickbar, then memorising the series of numbers to press to craft the trap of interest. IE F4 [crafting skills menu] -&gt; 5 [craft a trap] -&gt; 2 [electrical] -&gt; 1 [minor] might craft an minor electrical trap, for example, but it depends on the components you are carrying.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><strong>My current standard trap layout</strong></strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/202001/10759084_2b06baf7db2c7f1ca908f3170529b374_t.jpg\"/><br/>\n<strong>Trap free area</strong><br/>\nThe trap free area is where I pull enemies when I don't want to use the traps, to 'save them'. (a similar concept to saving spells, for example).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the purpose of this post I have defined these enemies I don't want to use damaging traps on as 'easy enemies'. These enemies funnily enough include difficult opponents I don't want to use my traps on, such as\u00a0 high dexterity monks with evasion/improved evasion who might just charge through such traps without a scratch, wrecking my trap field.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Weaker traps (non-disable)</strong><br/>\nThe weaker traps are designed to to damage or kill enemies that I want to use the traps on.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThis might be weak enemies around bosses I cannot pull individually, boss summons/familiars/animal companions, or moderate difficulty non-boss enemies.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe weaker traps can be individual, or they may have variable amounts of stacking. I like to have a mixture. In this example I have stacked between 1-4 minor fire traps in this area, but a different situation I might use stronger traps or stack more traps (or weaker traps/use less traps).<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are all traps I don't mind losing, they aren't particularly special to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Tangle traps</strong>\u00a0<strong>(slow) - optional</strong><br/>\nAgainst enemies without freedom, these traps have a high reflex save DC (20-35) and I believe can be stacked forcing multiple saves per round. They could be placed in the area where weaker traps are marked on the screen. This appears optimal if your party has substantial ranged firepower (such as archer builds, sorcerer builds, wizards, UMD/arcane users with wands of fire/ILMS etc) and the opponents do not have freedom.<br/>\n<br/>\nA high base reflex save will be 12 + dexterity modifier at level 20 and 22 + dexterity modifier at level 40.\u00a0<br/>\nA low base reflex save will be 6 + dex mod at level 20 and 16 + dex mod at level 40.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn practice the way I translate this is that one or two deadly tangle traps should be effective to slow fighter types and mages. Multiple tangle traps would be required for rogues and assassins.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI have not tested this however and appreciate any corrections you might make, and am prepared to edit the main post if I am found to be incorrect.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Stronger traps</strong><br/>\nThese traps I place for bosses, and potentially wish to save them otherwise. These are higher grade traps aimed at dealing damage (fire, electrical, deadly spike traps, deadly blob of acid traps, epic traps), or very large stacks of lower grade traps (ie multiple minor fire/electrical traps).<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>No stun traps (ie frost, sonic, acid blob) in the damage trap area</strong><br/>\nI don't particularly want stun traps in this damage trap area, especially the early part of the trap field, as a stunned enemy will stand still, and potentially encourage friendly melee combatants to the area.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIf further traps go off, these might damage or kill my allies (or myself) if the PvP setting allows for friendly damage.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough I am flexible in that regard and would tolerate deadly blob of acid traps at the outskirts of any combat zone<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes players and the AI just see an enemy and charge to be honest despite your chat request or AI order request to stand your ground!\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Stun traps, summons, companions and teammates (optional)</strong><br/>\nThis white line indicates where I want to place these. Summons and companions will be ordered to 'Stand your ground' to avoid them receiving AoE damage from the traps.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeammates will be requested to stand in those locations.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Direction of enemy pull</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/202001/10759084_8a1eded55e34667a12de699ff80cc30d_t.jpg\"/><br/>\n<br/>\nPulling means I attract the enemies attention and they chase me.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThis diagram demonstrates the directions I 'pull' enemies.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nUsually this will be with a ranged weapon (such as this example) or with a wand, although it might simply be the enemy seeing me and walking towards me.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nDetection skills such as listen and spot, or the True Seeing spell are valuable in knowing you have pulled certain enemies<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the green direction I pull 'Easy' enemies, these are enemies I don't want to use my traps. As discussed this could include dexterity monks with evasion who will take minimal damage from my traps.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the orange direction, I pull 'Medium' enemies, these are enemies I want to use weaker traps on.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the red direction, I pull 'Hard' enemies, these are enemies I want to use both my weaker and strong traps on.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nTeammates, summons, animal companions/familiars are in the white area. AI summons/companions are ordered to 'Stand your Ground', as teammates are as well. This is to prevent them from being annihilated when AoE fire/electrical traps activate.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI also, optionally, can put a smattering of disable traps (frost, sonic and acid blob) in the white area. Disable traps are completely countered by both freedom and stun/mind immunity.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Not all traps are made equal.\u00a0</strong><br/>\nI found this out through playing experience.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Most opponents</em><br/>\nIn terms of sheer damage, with no disables, and assuming no evasion, against most opponents (clerics, fighters, mages), I believe fire traps and electrical traps are best. They appear to do the most damage / trap, and have the added advantage of targeting more than one enemy at once.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAlchemist's fire ideally should be crafted into deadly fire traps if possible, although minor fire traps are effective if the enemy's reflex save is low and there is no evasion/improved evasion.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nQuartz crystals should be crafted into the electrical trap that will likely beat your opponents reflex DC, although deadly electrical traps appear very reliable in general.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nDeadly spike traps may be useful as well but not weaker versions of the spike traps. Strong and deadly acid blob traps but not weaker versions also output reasonable damage and provide a potential disable.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAcid blob traps are attractive against enemies without freedom and weak reflex saves. The reflex DC is 25 for deadly acid blob traps. A few traps may need to be set for this to be reliable. Unfortunately these traps cannot be crafted.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore details in further analysis.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Evasion/Improved Evasion users</em><br/>\nAgainst these opponents (rogues, monks), either no save damaging traps or disabling traps can be considered in addition to the standard traps suggested above.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother option is to avoid using traps against them by pulling them away from your traps, one could use the method described above..<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately no save traps do limited damage, with the exception being holy traps against undead, and epic frost/sonic traps.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think stacked minor holy and minor sonic traps are the ideal traps for no save damage, I have observed holy water and thunderstones can be potentially stacked, although I have observed non-stackable holy water as well. Happy to receive comments on this.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrost traps disable if they fail a fortitude save. The deadly trap fortitude DC is 15. Quite a few traps might need to be stacked for the disable to be reliable.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSonic traps disable if they fail a will save. The deadly trap will DC is 20. Again quite a few traps might need to be stacked for the disable to be reliable.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth frost and sonic traps can be crafted with coldstones/thunderstones.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Undead</em><br/>\nHoly traps can be considered to do damage against these in addition to electrical and fire traps.<br/>\n<div class=\"codebox\"><p>Code: <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"selectCode(this); return false;\">Select all</a></p><pre><code>Median non-disabling minor trap damage, listed highest to lowest\n\n\nType\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Approx.

to damage ratios for minor, average, strong and deadly traps</strong><br/>\nThis is another interesting question I wished to answer, as it also ties into what traps one might wish to craft to deal the most damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, I might be facing a group of enemies with low reflex DCs and no evasion. In this situation, is it best to craft minor electrical traps with those 35 quartz crystals I've hoarded, or should I craft them into deadly traps?<br/>\n<br/>\nI calculated the number of components needed to deal 500 damage using different strength of crafted trap (minor, average, strong and deadly)<br/>\n<div class=\"codebox\"><p>Code: <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"selectCode(this); return false;\">Select all</a></p><pre><code>Components to deal 500 damage (assuming no saves, resistances, immunities, reductions or improved evasion)\n\n\nType\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Minor (1)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Average (3)\u00a0 \u00a0Strong (5)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Deadly (7)\n\nelectrical [quartz crystal]\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a017.9\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a028.5\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 35.5\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 33.6\nfire [alchemist fire]\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a026.3\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a053.7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 47.5\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 23.8\nspike [caltrops]\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 71.4\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0142.8\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0143.0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a039.9\n\nholy undead [holy water]\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 22.7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a054.3\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 57\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 53.2\n\nnegative [skeleton knuckle]\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a071.4\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0142.8\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0143.0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0129.5\nholy [holy water]\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0100.0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 200.1\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0166.5\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0175\n\nacid spash [acid flask]\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a055.6\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0111.0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0111.0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a097.3\n\nfrost [coldstone]\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0100.0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 200.1\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0200.0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0175.0\nsonic [thunderstone]\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 100.0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 200.1\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0200.0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0175.0</code></pre></div>\n\nIn general if damage is the only outcome measure, minor traps provided the best component to damage ratio (ie best 'bang for buck').<br/>\n<br/>\nThe exception being deadly fire traps and deadly spike traps.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn reality, one <strong>must </strong>take into account the likely reflex save of the opponents one will face, if the trap has a DC reflex save for 1/2 damage.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso the likelihood of the components being lost if the craft trap skill is not particularly high.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is safe to say, in general, if one can craft deadly fire and spike traps reliably, that would be the ideal way to utilise these components.<br/>\n<br/>\nMinor holy traps are almost always the most efficient way to utilise their components.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther traps one must consider other effects,\u00a0and the DC of the opponent.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Too long, didn't read (TL,DR) [or conclusions]</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n- I set traps to allow for three different pull directions, depending on whether:<br/>\n-&gt; I want the opponent to avoid my trap, or<br/>\n-&gt; I want the opponent to be damaged by my weaker traps, or\u00a0<br/>\n-&gt; I want the opponent to be damaged by both my weaker and stronger traps<br/>\n<br/>\n- I set the traps in a green carpet fashion with variable amounts of stacking, the weaker traps at the front, the stronger traps at the back<br/>\n<br/>\n- Tangle traps (potentially stacked) can be used to slow opponents to pepper them with ranged attacks, if the enemy does not have freedom<br/>\n<br/>\n- Disable traps I place on the outskirts of the trap field.
