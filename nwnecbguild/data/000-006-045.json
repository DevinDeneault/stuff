It also let me hit 32 Spell Penetration, guaranteeing that I can beat any Spell Resistance granted by items (important later). Rogue 13 gave me access to Epic Dodge, UMD, Tumble, and Sneak Attack, all of which are used heavily with my playstyle and build. Monk 1 was mostly for Monk AC. I'll be honest, my roleplayer took over and I actually put Weapon Focus in Rapier because I thought they looked cooler, but in a min-max ECB build you get to utilize Kamas with the juicy Monk attack schedule attached to that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI only went to 18 Wisdom so that I could cast Silenced Word of Faith. With how I play, I did not want to bother with any of the level 9 spells Clerics could cast and instead using my melee weapons. This also allowed me to maximize Dexterity and take other feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nSilence is the namesake spell of the build, and the spell that I have built around. Firstly, Silence is extremely effective against enemy spellcasters, shutting off access to any spells they might have unless they have the ability to cast silent spells. While I am in Sanctuary, Silence will not cause me to break it as I cast it on myself, helping me prep for fights after scouting it out. Finally, it allows me to cast Darkness or Word of Faith on enemies with Blind Fight and still cause them to be flat-footed for Sneak Attack. Taking Spell Penetration is important, because Silence will check Spell Penetration. 32 is the maximum Spell Penetration NWN 1 gives to items, and seemed like a good benchmark to hit.<br/>\n<br/>\nCraft Wand was a feat that I have overlooked before, but realized that it was extremely helpful as I was soloing dungeons. Spells that I use a lot, like Darkness and Find Traps, are amazing to keep around. Wands are also useable while I am Silenced, giving me access to things that I might not have had otherwise.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nMy AB and AC are not the highest, but they are compensated with my spells. Word of Faith allows me to have another 50% chance to not get hit, stacking with Improved Invisibility. It also gives me a +2 AB and +4 AC bonus (penalty to enemy AB). I also get penalize my enemy AC for causing them to be flat-footed. This results in reliable hits and very rarely getting hit back.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's also UMD goodness in here. Woohoo!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe build I found that used the Silence concept was<br/>\n<br/>\nGrizzled Dwarflord's\u00a0Vicar of the Void (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/vicar-of-the-void-cleric-35-monk-4-ranger-1-t2355317.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">vicar-of-the-void-cleric-35-monk-4-rang ... 55317.html</a>)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso thanks to Maximillian for all of the Clerical knowledge floating around the Internet, it helped inform this build a ton!<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Swapped Defensive Roll and Improved Evasion.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Rapiers (and kukris) have better threat range, but kamas have the monk attack schedule and can be dual wielded with minimum penalty.<br/>\nPersonally I prefer to take Defensive roll before Improved evasion. Reflex saves are high and you already have evasion, so you are not going to fail that save very often. DR has something new to offer, also based on the high reflex save, but is limited to once per rest cycle. So what will save your life most often? You can do the math, but the result depends on the criteria you choose.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
