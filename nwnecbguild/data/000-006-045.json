      "content": "<div>A fairly straightforward build which I haven't seen on the forum or the archives, it has Epic Spell Focus in four spell schools and 38 INT (50 with +12 INT).<br/>\nAt level 40 it has the ability to set epic traps, and (depending on the focus choice) has high DC spells against all three saves which allows it to exploit the weakest save of any opponent.<br/>\nAt level 40 the spell DC of the focused schools is 30 + Spell Level (+6 with +12 INT), maxing at 45 DC for level 9 spells. For example, with +12 INT this can result in a 45 DC Dominate Monster &amp; Wail Of The Banshee, a 44 DC Sunburst, a 42 DC Undeath To Death, and a 37 DC Grease.<br/>\nAt level 36 the build gains Epic Warding which is a significant defensive buff despite the short duration.<br/>\nThe build doesn't have UMD but it can use all crafted wands and all mage scrolls (apart from any specialist school restrictions).<br/>\nOne of the main downsides of the build is low HP, especially in the early levels where the DCs are fairly low. Using summons and companions properly is the key to survival at low levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nGnome is actually the best choice of race since it gives 40 HP, 3 Concentration, and the small size helps against Evard's Black Tentacles. However choosing gnome over human means losing 43 skill points and restricts one of the focuses to illusion, which has fairly lacklustre DC spells. If you want illusion as one of your focuses then I recommend switching from human to gnome.<br/>\nSilent Spell at level 10 can be switched for Extend Spell or Still Spell if a different metamagic feat is wanted.<br/>\nChoosing a specialist school gives extra spell slots at the cost of losing an entire spell school. I recommend being a generalist unless you already have mage experience in the environment you plan on playing this build in.<br/>\nThe build below (and most of my builds in general) sacrifice playability while levelling for a better result at level 40. This means no Spell Penetration feats and delaying Epic Spell Focus feats until level 36 in order to gain more skill points. Another problem is that this build can't use Set Trap until level 40, which can be solved by moving one rank to level 1 and rearranging the skill progression.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who want something more extreme it is possible to have five Epic Spell Focuses, but that requires dropping metamagic feats and/or Epic Warding. A Wiz38/Monk1/Rang1 has 1 spare feat after the focuses, a Wiz29/CoT10/Rang1 has 2 spare feats.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nClass: Wizard 38 / Monk 1 / Ranger 1<br/>\nRace: Human<br/>\nAlignment: Any

      "content": "<div>There are multiple alternative builds such as Monk3/Wiz36/Rog1, Rog3/Wiz36/SD1, or Rog2/Wiz38 which have better skill progression at the cost of either Epic Warding or focuses. Assuming that they are optimised for 40 then the first wizard level for all three builds would be taken at level 2 in order to maximise the number of skill points.<br/>\nFor alternative wizard\u00a0 builds with two or three focuses I would recommend switching to gnome and picking up Extend Spell, Toughness, and Epic Skill Focus: Concentration. If AC is wanted then Armor Skin, Epic Mage Armor, Improved Combat Casting, and\u00a0Improved Expertise are also feats to consider.<br/>\nHalfling grants +1 to saves and higher DEX, but gnome is almost always the best race for mages due to the higher CON and the racial Concentration buff. Depending on the build, dwarf and human are usually the second best choices.</div>"
