      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Having seen Web's revelation of the recent changes to Shifter:\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/a-big-heads-up-regarding-shifter-changes-in-the-ne-t2356298.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/a-big-heads-up-regarding-shifter-changes-in-the-ne-t2356298.html</a> , and in the absence of a Shifter Guide here (though I've just finished reading Mark Sword's Guide in the WoG archive, but that was written just prior to v1.64's release, so has doubtless changed since then, and probably dramatically in some cases), I thought now might be a good time to discuss the class in some more depth - because I for one have only played it once, and that was with a Minotaur/ Risen Lord build (though I confess that I'm contemplating going with an Epic Drow Warrior shape build in the not too distant future) - and I remain fairly clueless about everything other than the basics.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I know you need at least 5 levels of Druid for Wildshape and the Alertness feat before the class opens up. I also know armour always merges with the shape, while weapons and/or items only merge depending on the shape chosen, gloves/braces never do, and all AC bonuses from gear default to the highest single bonus, which is taken as Deflection AC whatever it was beforehand. Many of the shapes also override your PC's stats, some severally, and certainly in most cases you can trash Strength at least. Wisdom, Intelligence and Constitution appear to be the most useful stats to raise, and if you can afford it, some points in Dexterity or Charisma might be useful for a particular build. I don't believe Weapon Focus merges (though that might just be for unarmed builds), but Improved Critical does, as does Epic Prowess. I know even less about caster shapes than \"real\" casters (if that's even possible).<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, any information about the class would be very helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
