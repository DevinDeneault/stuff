Dwarf also grants +2 to saves against spells/spell like abilities so in practice the will save I have got up to 10<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you choose the subrace with the build I designed you will gain about 20hp perhaps but lose slightly over 40 skill points, and you would have to give up stealth skills as a result, also improved knockdown<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Will save being poor is normal for rogue builds, like I mean its one of the most powerful classes in the game, we can't give it everything. That being said I do play a lot of low save builds, mentored in part by other players, particularly Gkorjax. The big way I manage a poor will save is clarity potions, UMD, items or party members. I dont know if you have easy access to clarity potions, or if you are playing in a party with wizards who can cast lesser mind blank on you or you have access to lesser mind blank scrolls/wands, or even if there are fear immunity belts or mind immunity items, it doesn't sound like it, and with the bonuses in the build in practice the will save ends up around 10 which isn't too bad considering<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll stop there I'm postulating with a bit of missing information here, but made my best guess at what might suit, and perhaps others /myself might refine it further based on any further information I receive</div>"

      "content": "<div>I have not played for very long at all on PoTM so this is more supposition than fact.  I have played on other level limited and customised servers however both RP and Action.<br/>\n<br/>\nRavenloft is an undead setting which generally means much of your opponents will be immune sneak attack.  If this is the case, this is a large impact to a Rogue build which relies on sneak attack to make that build effectively compete with other melee builds.  As such, a strength rogue or fighter/rogue blend is likely to be more effective than straight rogue for melee combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith respect to monks, monks tend to be \u201cforgotten\u201d on most persistent worlds, primarily because they are very equipment dependant and equipment for monks is just for monks.  Most other equipment can be used by many/most/all classes.  From my limited understanding, Ravenloft is no different and Monk is not a viable \u201cprimary class\u201d build there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs Ravenloft is a RP server, I suspect people will tell you \u201cany class /build will work\u201d.  In my experience this is rarely the case.  I suspect that both Rogue and Monk will be challenging and frustrating for a new player and perhaps challenging and frustrating for a knowledgeable player :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI do not want to dissuade you, but I suspect neither is a great choice for a new player on that server.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>"

      "content": "<div>If there are lots of undead, what about a Cleric 17 / Rogue 2-3 type build, rogue is just for skill dumps, cleric 17 for level 9 spells. If you can get away with Rogue 2 you could add a level of fighter for a bonus feat<br/>\nPerhaps if you go human + have Int 14, you will get 5 (2 from cleric, 2 from int, 1 from human) skill points per level, allowing you to max Disable Trap, Open Lock, Set Trap, then spread the remain points into concentration, search tumble and UMD. Your BAB will be 14 but divine power can boost it up<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit Paladin 17 rogue 3 would be good too possibly even better if you don't mind being lawfully good alignment - fear immune disease immune, divine damage freedom death ward spells plus good saves and BAB 19 buffable with bulls strength eagles splendor and aura of glory</div>"

Ive been playing with the tought of one aswell :)</div></blockquote>\nFor a POTM monk, my personal preference would go to something like this (take into account that POTM has lots of modifications over standard NWN, so some things like the number of feats might surprise you):<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk (20)<br/>\nRace: Silvanesti elf (best race in the server for dex based monk IMO with +2 DEX +2 INT -2 CON -2 CHA and the usual elf feats +darkvision, +1 spellcraft, and being dex based means we can use guns to great effect)<br/>\nBackgrounds (select after character creation in starting area): stalker (or whatever the one that gives you +1 hide and move silently is called), hunter (+1 move silently, +1 spot)<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 12<br/>\nDEX:17 (22)<br/>\nCON:12<br/>\nINT:16<br/>\nWIS:14<br/>\nCHA:6<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Blind fight<br/>\n02: Weapon finesse<br/>\n03: Exotic Weapon Proficiency<br/>\n04:<br/>\n05: Weapon focus: Flintlock<br/>\n06: Delven's Maneuver<br/>\n07:<br/>\n08: Gearling's Superposed Loading Technique<br/>\n09: Shrouded Dance<br/>\n10:<br/>\n11: Improved critical: Flintlock<br/>\n12: Careful handling<br/>\n13:<br/>\n14: Point Blank Shot<br/>\n15: Weapon Focus: Unarmed<br/>\n16:<br/>\n17: Expertise<br/>\n18: Improved Expertise<br/>\n19:<br/>\n20: Martial Supremacy<br/>\n<br/>\nSkills: Tumble 20 (26), Parry 23 (29), Discipline 23 (24), Hide 23 (30), Move Silently 23(31), Spot 23 (28), Spellcraft 1 (5) Disable traps 1 (4) Set traps 9 (15)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis build is made with PVP in mind because while PVP is relatively rare in the server, the PVP fights you might get into will likely have much more consequences than any other encounter in your character's life. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor PVE, you'll want to use your fists most of the time, but for PVP, guns are insanely good, especially as a monk, as you are very fast, enabling you to kite melee characters, and to use the great range from the guns for corner sneaking to great effect. Thus stealth is an essential part of your PVP strategy, and will also help you survive in PVE. <br/>\n<br/>\nSet traps gear is plentiful, so even with only 15 modified ranks in the skill, you can gear yourself up and set deadly traps. Again, extremely useful for PVP, if you know you're going to be attacked. Can also be used in PVE of course.<br/>\n<br/>\nParry is garbage in normal NWN, but in this server, every 5 modified ranks gives 1 shield AC until you get to 30 parry, so it's essential, except for sword and board builds that do not take the shield parry feat (Ravenloft custom feat, like many used in the above build).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if you'd prefer to build a more \"traditional\" monk (ie: no guns) or if you don't want to build for PVP, go for STR based (more unarmed damage, and more ways to boost STR than DEX for more melee AB in this server), and replace all the gun and ranged feats by improved disarm, toughness, dodge, and then save feats or energy resistance feats. If you're feeling particularly evil, you can take the voracious feat for additional strength and constitution, but beware: the life expectancy of a cannibal can be very short, as getting caught eating people tends to have heavy RP consequences. You may even consider crossclassing taunt (using the taunt+expertise combo of course), as there are lots of gear for that too, as well as feats and backgrounds, and while other classes have it as a class skill and could do it for you, I've found that people don't use it most of the time (and as a monk, that -6 penalty to ennemy AC can really make a huge difference).<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, don't take improved critical: unarmed, as one ring you will want to acquire will give you this feat + weapon specialization: unarmed.<br/>\n<br/>\nMonk is viable, and is said to be the most potent melee class at high level, but until you get some levels under your belt, it's going to be very challenging. I would not recommand it for your first character in POTM, unless of course you are looking for a challenge<br/>\n<br/>\nThough, take what I say with a grain of salt, because the highest level character I've played there was level 8.</div>"
