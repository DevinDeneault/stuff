Normally you have to be out of sight before entering stealth successfully, by running behind a corner etc.<br/>\nSo even if you can use HIPS, you still need good stealth skills to actually disappear out of sight and avoid being detected. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Hide skill is opposed by the Spot skill and the Move silently skill is opposed by the Listen skill. <br/>\n<br/>\nTrue seeing pierces stealth and invisibility spells and makes it almost impossible to go undetected. Some PWs\u00a0 use a modified version of the True seeing spell that detects invisibility and adds a bonus to the Spot skill, just so you don't ruin stealth altogether. This doesn't affect the TS item property and the TS from creature skins though, so a dragon with vanilla properties will see you, no matter what.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

What I get from what you say (which is not up for question, btw), HiPS is not the \"absolute\" that I'd thought, but is actually \"scaled\" (and not in a draconic way) Thus, the better your Hide, the deeper in shadows you'll be when you HiPS. That makes sense - so I hope I'm right.<br/>\n<br/>\nAin't it good to know I can still come up with new and different dumb-ass questions? No?

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Yes, it is scaled in the sense that you get better at hiding with better stealth skills. HIPS makes it possible to hide \"in plain sight\", but to succeed with not being detected you need good stealth skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow there is a \"but\" here. And that is how detection works; how often the hide, move silently, spot and listen skills are rolled, and how often they are checked.<br/>\nThe skills in question are rolled once every round (6 sec), but the results of the rolls are checked more often:<br/>\n Player detects stealth 5 times per second <br/>\nNPC detects stealth every 4 seconds<br/>\n<br/>\nThis means that there can be a short time window before your skills (the rolls) are checked and you can be detected. <br/>\nThis raises the question if spamming HIPS can make it possible to stall detection, at least by NPCs.<br/>\nI have not tested this on a low stealth build because my stealth builds already have high stealth skills.<br/>\nIn several PWs they have\u00a0 a \"Cool down timer\" (e.g. 6 seconds) on HIPS to prevent HIPS from being spammed.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy bottom line is that if you want to use stealth, you also want the skills to avoid being detected in the long run (long meaning anything more than a few seconds here)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
