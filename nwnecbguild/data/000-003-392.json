Looking for a powerful build for PvE and the occasional PvP confrontation.  Would prefer something with level nine cleric spells, as I tend to always play clerics, but I'm open to listening to others as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nClasses are pretty much NWN default, magical items up to +3, with possible +4.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf people need more info to give better suggestions, let me know.  =D<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The Monk level can be taken at 17 for a Tumble dump. Is that in line with what you want?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Or, how about a Cleric 18 or 19 / Monk 1 or 2 casting Darkfire on his kama(s)?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
