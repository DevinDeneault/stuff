      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">I am a heavy single player module player. After Swordflight Chapter III 's releasing, i am trying to continue my previous journey. My previous character in Swordflight is a RDD optimized for level 20. Since in Chapter III you can reach lv 23 and the author promised he would continue the series, i am planing to debug the character into a epic build with Lexicon.<br/>\n<br/>\n I had considered several melee build, like Ft/Cot/Rog, Ft/WM/Cot and Ft/WM/Rog. And my decision was made in the below process:<br/>\n<br/>\n 1. I would like to continue to play as a melee fighter, since i had collected so many equipment from Chapter II.<br/>\n<br/>\n 2. I like the UMD of thief, which is very helpful in self buff and buffing your teams, and it will bring me into the thief quest in Swordflight too.<br/>\n<br/>\n 3. COT is good for better saves and Weapon Master is best for the offense. Since it is quite easy to get some immune buff from equipment or UMD, i don't think it is necessary to go for COT.<br/>\n<br/>\n 4. I know WM25/Ft12/Rog3 is the most optimized spread, but i really can't stand to have Rog's skills until level 21. What is the point of having your character coming into fruit until the every end of the game. Not to mention that there is the possibility that i will miss some thief class only quests because i don't have thief class before level 21.<br/>\n<br/>\n 5. It was very tempting to go with a weapon master build with DW and DC for maximum killing power, but it is too feat intensive and i don\u2019t think 5 or 3 Rog classes will fit into the build well enough. Besides the fact that many creature especially the mini bosses and bosses are immune to DC really turn me off. \u00a0 \u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n So, the final spread is Weapon Master(25), Fighter(10), Rogue(5).<br/>\n<br/>\n Since it is my first time to make a build for my own, i think it maybe a good idea to post it here and let the experts give me some suggestions.<table

Compared with the build of Max in the below thread, my build has 1 less feat of IKD and 40 pts less of hp, but comes with 1 more pts of damage and 70 pts more of skills, which help me to maximize out the concentration skill. And i think my build is more easy to play from lv 1 to lv 20 too.<br/>\n What bothers me most is the lack of IKD. I don't know how big an issue this is. Should i drop 1 STR for IKD with the result of lowering my AB and damage by 1 pts, increasing my hp by 40pts and lost 40 pts of skill pts ?<br/>\n<br/>\n And yes, the weapon can or should be changed into a scimitar.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/522762/#.V9V0fFt97IV\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/52 ... 9V0fFt97IV</a><br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The problem here is that you need so many feats to qualify for WM and even more to qualify for Dev Crit, leaving you no wriggle room.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I'm trying to understand exactly what you are trying to do and not completely making the connection, so bear with me, please.<br/>\n<br/>\n 1. You want to redesign a toon that you played through SF 1 and 2.<br/>\n<br/>\n Are there any variables that RogueKnight stored on the bic that may affect how your toon responds to certain events in the 3rd installment?<br/>\n That may determine whether your plan will work or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n Are you planning to change the starting ability spread, class, race, etc.?\u00a0 If you do, it may overwrite those variables I mentioned above.<br/>\n<br/>\n 2. Since you are optimizing the build for Level 40, are you really sure you want to wait to reap the benefits until subsequent installments of SF are released?\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n If you check the timetable, it took RogueKnight over 8 years to release content that got the toon to its current level which you state will be Level 23 when SF3 has been completed (SF1 was originally released on 2-28-2008, then SF2 on 4-9-2012).\u00a0 He's designing his adventures essentially on his own so to maintain the high quality takes a lot of time (I'm sure he doesn't need to be reminded of that fact.). So if I do a quick estimate, that's roughly 3 toon levels per design year if the trend continues.\u00a0 That means the approx 18 levels needed to reach Level 40 should arrive somewhere around 2022, if at all, depending on RL issues that can change those sorts of eventualities.\u00a0 I'm just giving some facts that may change your original plan.<br/>\n<br/>\n 3. Even if you don't lose stored variables, why not just use a trainer/deleveler/releveler like <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/module/halls-advanced-training-deluxe-hotusou-edition\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Halls of Advanced Training</strong></span></a> to reset whatever you like?\u00a0 The \"untouchable\" elements will be the starting abilities, feats, race, class, skill allocation and alignment. After level 1, you can change just about anything and in minutes.\u00a0 I believe you might be able to change the bic directly using <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/other/leto-169\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span style=\"color:#0000FF\">Leto</span></strong></a> but need to be careful not to create a corrupted toon in the process.\u00a0 Leto should be able to even change all the starting level stats. Not sure about that but that's the rumor.<br/>\n<br/>\n Dunno. If it were me, I'd just start a new toon.\u00a0 Neither of the SF modules take that long and if it turns out your crafty manipulations accidentally overwrote some key variable, you won't find out until too late that it isn't working as you planned.\u00a0 Just my own opinion on the matter.<br/>\n<br/>\n As far as IKD is concerned, the more high-level mages and clerics and creatures with paralyzing or death special attacks, the more important is IKD.\u00a0 And undead mages are even worse since your crits won't affect them.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, in short, I understand your modification decisions.\u00a0 I just don't know how practical the overall strategy is.<br/>\n<br/>\n edit: Damn Stagmeister!\u00a0 Why use a quote for a reply immediately after the lead?\u00a0 That quote hurts my eyes and soul.\u00a0 PLease, please delete it.\u00a0 TYVM, mate!<br/>\n edit2: Whew!\u00a0 Much, much better.\u00a0 We can digest that small oops.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I value BF more than IKD.<br/>\n IMO, since i am a WM with a AB of 51, the lack of IKD will no hinder my power as great as that would on other melee characters.<br/>\n<br/>\n \"When you wonder about dropping 1 STR, are you talking about a Great Strength, and taking IKD in epic?

I will use the pic from my SF 2 character and i will delevel him to level 1 then relevel him using Debug Mode, and use the Leto program to add and remove feats or even change his race if need.<br/>\n But i never expect this process will disrupt any information stored in my bic files before posting. I think i will still give it a try. So far, i have a good experience with Debug Mode and Leto which is very handy and time saving.<br/>\n<br/>\n 2. I did optimize the build for level 40. As for the waiting, i really didn't give it much thought though. Myabe i should consider your suggestion of designing a lv 23 build, which will be a very interesting experience.<br/>\n But i think i will keep this thread for what it is, that is, a discussion of the feasibility of a build of lv 40 for the purpose of playing SP modules and the comparison of it with a WM25/Ft12/Rog3 one.<br/>\n<br/>\n 3. Restarting with a new toon will lose some data from my previous journey. With Leto, i can edit the build of my original character safetly, which is my original impression.<br/>\n \"As far as IKD is concerned, the more high-level mages and clerics and creatures with paralyzing or death special attacks, the more important is IKD.
