I know I am biased, but screw it, it's worth the fuss. It's a well-balanced mid-high magic SP module with a GREAT STORYLINE, AWESOME tilesets, and it has a really cool thing, which is that as you move forward through the story, your revisit areas and meet again with a couple of NPCs that you came in contact with during your early days and the whole area is just different, and the people as well, everything has moved on with time. It uses Tony K's AI, EMS and CEP enhancements to create THE ULTIMATE SP experience. It's available at the NWvault and has one of the highest ratings of all time! <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can download it from:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/module/aielund-saga-act-i-nature-abhors-vacuum\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Aielund Saga Act I - Nature Abhors a Vacuum</a><br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/module/aielund-saga-act-ii-defender-crown\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Aielund Saga Act II - Defender of the Crown</a><br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/module/aielund-saga-act-iii-return-ironlord\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Aielund Saga Act III - Return of the Ironlord</a><br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/module/aielund-saga-act-iv-fall-aielund-part-one\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Aielund Saga Act IV - The Fall of Aielund Pt1</a><br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/module/aielund-saga-act-iv-fall-aielund-part-two\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Aielund Saga Act IV - The Fall of Aielund Pt2</a><br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/module/aielund-saga-act-iv-fall-aielund-part-three\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Aielund Saga Act IV - The Fall of Aielund Pt3</a><br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

EMS is, at best, an accident waiting to happen.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAielund has become the standard for community content, as far as I am concerned.  I tend to judge the quality of most all Vault DLs against that design, perhaps a bit unfairly, because Aielund was the result of an almost fanatical obsession with detail and innovation, much to our mutual benefit.  It deserves to be the first one mentioned in this section IMHO.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">About EMS, though, there is a file that details spell changes, a few of which I tend to agree with. Divine Favor does Divine type damage with EMS, not magical, Deafening Clang does 5 Sonic, not 3, and lasts for 1 Turn per level. Harm and Heal are capped at 150, Blade Thirst lasts 1 Turn per level. Like in the original NWN, each player will have enough agreements and disagreements depending on their playstyle. I do think EMS is more balanced than vanilla NWN, but that's just my opinion. However, as Kail pointed out, if you're not comfortable with the alterations and / or are too lazy to learn them, like I was for a while, you can use EMSfake and play the saga with the regular magic system. This has an unfortunate side effect for Clerics and Paladins in the last battle of ACT 3. I won't get into this any further not to give any spoilers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe TXT file with detailed info on all altered spells comes with the download in the RAR file. <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Spell changes are not detailed properly (often it's just said it's working as per PnP rules) and the most recent updates are presented at the top of the readme file, thus forcing one to scroll down and look for less recent updates to the same feature and for the starting modification which is not always available for reference either. Short of opening up the hak and checking all the scripts there's no way to know exactly what the EMS hak does.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one thing that the EMS is severely lacking is proper documentation. One might like its features or not, that is a personal preference but I wonder how many out there really know all that the hak is doing. I really wished the author or some revisionist would take the time to write down all the changes in place.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

And I know I didn't miss any quests or didn't leave a single enemy alive because there used to be a website with a list of all the quests you could complete and I based myself off of that. Still pretty awesome that a campaign can go from level 1-33.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Windows Seven, I have it on my laptop and it makes your game crash more often than other players. For SP campaigns, as long as you save often, no real harm is done, but in onlne servers, you relog and your summons are gone, and whatever buffs you cast on them are wasted. In WoG Familiars and Companions can carry gear, so the gear is also gone, which is a major pain in the arse.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The only issues I have ever had is when a particular hak has been updated and I have an older one.  In a case like that, one will typically get a diagnostic that specifies the exact file name that is missing, a clue that the hak has been revised.  Some times the individual files have been provided for DL but most times you just need the latest version. But, in general, each hak that is called by a server (or module) is specific enough to avoid dichotomy problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, should you ever find a problem while playing new custom content, it is a good habit to keep some sort of dated listing of all the haks and overrides in their respective folders.  That way, when you play new content and something seems amiss, you can more easily identify the \"offending\" hak.  Not all haks and overrides are created equal!<br/>\n<br/>\nA topic probably better posted separately, just in case others have the same question (embedded info is hard or impossible to find).

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hello Everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\n Have come here to play, hope Max doesn't mind. As the previous contributions herein have concurred, Aielund is a great adventure! At least, the first Chapter is (takes you from levels 1-9 - <em>with </em>companions, and soloing it, while probably possible, would be a serious waste, as well as suicidal). The end of \"Nature Abhors A Vacuum\" (chap1) is precisely as far as I've reached thus far. And it's the first big-boy alternate I've played since the OC/SoU/HotU, so I hope you'll forgive dumb-assery as I move through. My intention is <em><strong>not </strong></em>to do a walkthrough, merely to raise issues I encounter in Aielund that may have implications elsewhere<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm aware that some of the issues I'll be raising are not going to be 'build-specific', but an example in Chapter 1 (and I assume throughout) is that if you're constructing a build with Bard, with an INT of 14 you'd expect 6 skill points per level (4 +INT modifier). I'm getting 8. Don't get me wrong, with my particular build this means I can max UMD and Listen and still have 15 points to play with, so no complaints! However, neither Fighter nor RDD get an additional 2, or even 1 extra point. So, I don't know which, if any, other character types attract a 'bonus', or even if any receive a minus hit on SPs. Thus, the environment in which one plays may have a direct impact on an effective build.<br/>\n<br/>\n Blimey, that was long-winded. Hope it made some sense (and at least Empyre's noticed it as well, so it ain't just me miscalculating! And yes, Empyre, I'm using your name as a 'kitemark' without asking - sorry, but not very <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" />).<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, as it transpires, I'm now on a ship heading for Fairloch and returning a princess, which is nice. Just an observation or two, if I may...<br/>\n<br/>\n 1. If you've only played the OC etc, you have no idea of quite how dark those Neverwinter nights can be. Take a torch and use it - seriously. And I'm playing an Elf for goodness' sake!<br/>\n<br/>\n 2. 'Ride', or 'Mounted Action', or whatever the damn thing's called, might not be quite as useless as previously thought - I've just had to deal with (as in 'kill') a bloke on a horse, and actively riding it, so if that's in Chapter 1, who knows how things will progress? (Interestingly enough, when chatting with my companions I did notice that an option was to tell them, essentially, to get off their horse and drink their milk...)<br/>\n<br/>\n 3. There appear to be many new and wonderful-seeming weapons in certain merchants' stores, but I am reliably informed by Empyre that you you can't take a feat in them (eg, WF or WS) - and that Katana is differently attributed. Be careful out there!<br/>\n<br/>\n That's it for now. Hope you don't mind me attempting to hijack this thread!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">The only question you asked is about horses. The old version of the Aielund Saga I have is from before horses were added, and the new version of the Aielund Saga that is being worked on will remove them, so I will never ride horses in the Aielund Saga.<br/>\n<br/>\n I have read that horses break some conversations triggers. In some areas, there is a line that will trigger a conversation when you cross it, but if you are on a horse, it won't trigger, maybe because you are moving too fast. That is why horses are going to be removed, and why I am waiting for that new version before I upgrade my Aielund Saga.<br/>\n<br/>\n If you want to be effective with any weapon you find, here's a build I made for the Aielund Saga that achieves a 44 AB with no weapon-specific feats: <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/515536#.VqfYy1LDTWw\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Universal Warrior: Fighter 18 / Bard 12 / RDD 10</a><br/>\n However, I recommend a katana-specific build.

However, you mention a new version coming out, so I might wait for that to try my own attempt. You don't happen to know roughly when that might be, do you?<br/>\n<br/>\n I have no problem with horses in particular, but a heads-up in advance could have been handy (it does indeed look as if I'll be doing some riding in this version)!

It's akin to working on your car and then reading the manual afterwards to discover how badly you screwed up.<br/>\n<br/>\n And yes, Max is one-of-a-kind.\u00a0 For sure. <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /></div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hello again!<br/>\n<br/>\n I've been playing two games in tandem - one with my little elven tank (which is on pause until the other catches him up), the other with a bastardised version of Empyre's (yes, you again!) Order of the Wyrm - Monk25/Sorcerer1/RDD14 (\"Fister\" version, as the more prosaic amongst us would have it). Bastardised because this isn't going to be a Dev Crit build, obviously, so I've a little license with it. One thing I have done in the first few levels is taken some Heal skill points (making sure I've still got my 8 Lore points for RDD), 'cos it's really tough going without <em>any</em> ability to use health scrolls, particularly if your Cleric gets splatted. If you like, I'll post my final build when I get to the end (I'm doing some minor remodelling on the hoof, as it were).<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, I digress. I'm in Fairloch in the 2nd mod, and thought it was interesting that there's a quest on offer to my LG Wyrm-boy that wasn't to my CG Elf-tank. It may be that it's predicated on my getting the Pally companion that I couldn't get last time (wasn't lawful enough), so I'm unclear as to cause and effect, but the Cathedral became a lot more interesting. Oh, and I didn't bother with Clarity potions last time, but they're a damn fine idea if you get the quest! Don't know yet whether I'll be barred from any other quest my other character could take.<br/>\n<br/>\n Have since dropped the Pally in a pub, and picked up a Barbar instead (in another pub). Risky move - of the 3 of us, no one's a healer. But I'm rich as Croesus, so can afford loads of potions/kits. We'll see how it goes...<br/>\n<br/>\n Also potentially of interest, I notice that I'm almost a full level better off with this build currently (levelled up to 10 while still on the ship) - same companions, same quests (during the 1st mod anyway), so who knows? Still having a grand old time of it!<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and Empyre, will be taking both your DEX-ing Monk/SD/Fighter and at least one of the Universal Warriors around Aielund next time - hope that's ok. <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I've always struggled with it since I blasted through it a couple of times early on, when I mistakenly believed it to be the follow-on to the OC (47 XP for deading a dragon seemed a tad mean, which should have been a clue!). I now know better. However, I guess the problem I've had is that I know what I <em>should</em> be doing, but am not yet sufficiently matured as a character to do it (by which I mean as an in-game character, so no cheap gags, please!). But one of the nice things is that, at least until you reach Undrentide, the gear isn't overly spectacular, so you actually get to know your character and what different feats and skills can do, rather than relying on the shiny things.<br/>\n<br/>\n No play today - boo. Will try and squeeze some in tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Meanwhile, back in Aielund...<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm now in Return of the Ironlord with my (Empyre's) Monk/RDD/Sorcerer (currently L19), and have a few questions/observations - without dropping thunking great spoilers, I hope.<br/>\n<br/>\n Manged to roll through Part 2 with Barbarian and Rogue companions - was tempted by a cute little Druid, but thought I'd try full tanking - just needed a few more rest breaks, but it went okay without all the added Druid buffs. And the AI worked fine with the Rogue making his own mind up whether to use melee or ranged weaponry, which was nice! Don't really have much to say about Part 2 other than it was great fun - mixing outdoor expanses with indoor crawling really well. Only a little thing...I'm guessing the author (architect?) had a linear plot in mind that I didn't follow, resulting in my having some very odd conversations and picking up several quests before they were assigned (in one instance completing it), but nothing problematic, and it's better not to be forced down one particular path by the DM imo.<br/>\n<br/>\n However, as I started in Part 3 it quickly became apparent that I should have been rather more of a pack-rat, and hung onto some of the prestigious items. Highly irritating to have to fork out a fortune for equipment that's worse than you had previously! Also irksome given that, for once, I'd been a good boy and done some 'proper' inventory management <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\n Also, the AI seems to have taken a downturn. If a person has a WS in BS and I equip them with one (+3), I don't then expect them to swap it out for a +2 Battleaxe they happen to be carrying as soon as any melee begins! I also gave everyone lots of heal kits and potions and they steadfastly refused to use them, leading to far too many deaths (theirs) and reloads (ran out of Raise Dead scrolls). However, I'm now back in Culdeny (which seems to be considerably reinforced) and can pick up an old friend who could help with this...<br/>\n<br/>\n And now for the question, also about companions. Up until now, they've all been single class, but I now have a Rogue/Wiz - and I'd like them to progess in one class only (Wiz, 'cos their spells are somewhat sucky at the moment, while their de-trapping and unlocking are fine) from now on. In SoU/HotU, if I remember correctly, you could tell any companion to do this (Deekin rocks!), but I don't seem to be getting that option here. Am I missing the dialogue option on how to do it, or does it not exist?<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm aware this is a lot of prattling for one little question, but I've been away. Sorry.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I get what you say about weapon switching, I was just annoyed given the quality of the AI to that point (the particular character narked me anyway - I also gave him a dragon-slaying sword, and not once did he use it, merely got afraid a lot. It was, therefore, no question about replacing him with the lovely Nellise, who has been extraordinarily good (so far).<br/>\n<br/>\n Er, having just levelled to 20 (conclusion of the re-entering of the Exiled Knight's tomb - one of the few doors still open!), Criosa has just gone to Rogue 11, Wizard 9.

This not the case with Empyre's installation since he DL'd Aielund quite some time ago, even as far back as before the IGN Vault closed its doors (IIRC that happened circa 2013-14).\u00a0 I may be able to find the original metadata in Rolo's archive that would surely identify the CEP version req'd at that time and probably what Empyre DL'd.<br/>\n<br/>\n The more I've sampled from the new Vault the more I suspect that ALL the required resources to earlier versions of CEP, regardless of the modules or authors themselves, have been substituted globally with 2.6 and Aielund is just one example.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n What I'll probably do is use the custom hak, tilesets and music with my installed version of CEP (2.3).\u00a0 Unless 2.6-specific content was added to the modules at some point, I suspect the series should play fine and then not affect my other NWN venues.\u00a0 If not... well... at least I tried.\u00a0 It is relatively easy to separate the custom resources without affecting the default structure.\u00a0 The main files I check are the 2das.\u00a0 I run a Diff between the new version and the current to determine if there are any potential conflicts and then either leave them where installed or move them to a temp folder until I find out how each one affects my gameplay with default content, the servers I play and the modules we use in our LAN games.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n I am hoping it works with just CEP 2.3 because I honestly don't have time for other amount of testing.<br/>\n<br/>\n @Empyre: Yes, I've checked that BSN topic several times but never figured out if any of the \"improvements\" had been implemented (or when) or whether an updated version of CEP was part of the tweaking process.\u00a0 If you can understand that whole thread, your perception is light years beyond my own and you deserve the ECB Award of Transcendent Insight.<br/>\n<br/>\n edit: Woohoo! GOT IT!\u00a0 The original Part 1 was loaded to IGN Vault in 2003 and used CEP 2.1 &amp; Aielund hakpak v2.0 ONLY so I think I am good to go.\u00a0 I doubt I'll have any gamestoppers because I can always open it up in the toolset to find what I missed or what variable didn't set properly. The only fuzziness is whether there is another hakpak needed (per Savant's readme: \"4. The Enhanced Magic System Hakpack.\" as distinct from the Aielund hakpak.\u00a0 Dunno if this is referring to playing with PRC or not. None of the tilesets or music listed in the new Vault were there either.\u00a0 Perhaps Empyre can shed light on this with his 2006 version.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The CEP version was no more recent than 2.3 (the most recent version I have installed); the current Vault page for the Aielund Hakpack (v2.0) lists the CEP version as 2.1, so that ought to be the requirement.<br/>\n<br/>\n You should need either EMS.hak or EMS_FAKE.hak to play.

Her own light gear is pretty damn good anyway, but good to know not to shell out on something useless. One thing does irk me somewhat, however: every time she switches from sling to dagger, she unequips her shield - ditto the other way around. Am I missing something about druids and/or halflings carrying shields, or do I have to keep swapping the shield back in every time she goes into/comes out of melee? Admittedly, I don't intend her to be a hand-to-hand fighter, but if she has to it would be nice if she had the best AC possible. Oh, and she's already unmasked Sparky in the Thieves' Guild. Hardly crucial, but raised a smile.<br/>\n<br/>\n I know I was flippant about why to take her in my last post, but the real reason is that I am testing my Monk/Fighter/CoT, so I'm afraid I'm going to have to make him my sole tank - it would have been too easy to have him work in tandem with the Barbarian then say, \"Dead simple - perfect build.\" This way, I'll get to know strengths and weaknesses better, for later reporting. It's also nice having someone smaller than me in the party (I'm a dwarf). Not flippant at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n Think I'm going to deliver my package to Amalis before going further on my assassin hunt - can get some better Monk gear and sort out Maggie's problem on the way. The additional xp would also be useful!<br/>\n<br/>\n Hope everyone's well<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Acknowledging that this is predominantly a building site, and that I've been conspicuously crap at providing builds, everything I've attempted to construct I've tried to take through \"real-game\" experience, rather than a test arena (particularly as I haven't yet joined a PW). Initially, this meant the OC (with Aribeth's Redemption sometimes), or SoU and HotU (latterly followed by Sands of Fate, which I'm still ballsing up). None of which (SoF excluded) took me beyond L28. This made testing L40 builds a tad difficult. I finally downloaded Aielund in January this year, and have been engrossed by its story virtually constantly since then (barring occasional homesick retreats into BG and IWD).<br/>\n<br/>\n However, I have constantly run into trouble when exiting the town of Trinity in Act 3, Return of the Ironlord. I think it behoves me to put a potential *SPOILER* alert here, even though I suspect most if not all of you have played this module. I think I now know (at last) what I've been getting wrong...<br/>\n<br/>\n Would I be correct in surmising that I don't actually have to vanquish the Ironlord in Trinity? Can I just run away and confront him later (presumably in Highmarch)? I'm sorry if this makes me come across as really stupid (no comments, please), but I've tried everything else I can think of to beat the tin minotaur, and Nell, Criosa and I always seem to end up deader than several very dead things.<br/>\n<br/>\n Confirmation of either my surmising or ongoing stupidity (please not both) would be gratefully received. Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n PS - quiet around these parts right now, ain't it?<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Kinda like solving a tech problem.\u00a0 e.g....<br/>\n<br/>\n What is the class combo level you have reached at this juncture?\u00a0 HP, AB &amp; AC wouldn't hurt either unless you are a caster of some sort, but I suspect that is not the case.\u00a0 In any event, use the stats with your full gear equipped and describe any enhancements you feel are important like DR penetration, immunities, haste, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n Generally, what is your toon's skill set?<br/>\n<br/>\n Are you able to cast summons via scrolls or items and, if so, have you used them in conjunction with your companion?<br/>\n<br/>\n What buffs do you have access to and can you dispel or breach magic?<br/>\n<br/>\n What sort of special attributes does your \"uber\" foe possess?\u00a0 And related... if it can buff/cast spells, does your toon have enough Spellcraft to ID them via the combat log?\u00a0 Is it a True Seer? If not, invis pots should buy you heal/re-buff time.<br/>\n<br/>\n Naturally, if you are having trouble determining the full characterization of a foe, it would take someone with module experience like Empyre to help enlighten you.\u00a0 That's always the first step in defeating a foe... figure out the strengths and weaknesses and then plan a strategy around those.\u00a0 Strategy-wise, it could be as simple as pulling the boss away from its \"comfort zone\" to where your party is waiting.\u00a0 Can your toon set traps (assuming that they are even available, of course)?<br/>\n<br/>\n Basically, I am suggesting that rather than spoiling the pleasure of personal conquest, you may have it in your power to achieve your goal by just looking at the problem from a totally different perspective.\u00a0 At least that how I solve the seemingly-unsolvable.<br/>\n<br/>\n BTW, this a module-specific topic so anyone reading it should automatically expect the possibility of spoilers popping up, though it wouldn't hurt to use the handy spoiler code if you are really concerned that much.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

What would be extremely helpful for aspiring Aielund adventurers (and if you can find the time) would be to insert horizontal lines after each level that you, from experience, usually reach at end of each of the modules in the series.\u00a0 I suppose that could be construed as spoilerific, but BioWare did it for all their campaigns so it must be an acceptable practice.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Nevertheless, I agree with you and took your advice, moving the DEX dump from level 12 to level 8, getting the dual-wield feats several levels earlier.<br/>\n I also took your suggestion to change the name. The new name reflects that the build is for Aielund, has RDD in it, and dual-wields.

To be fair, Maggie's quest is one you pick up anyway (Feybourne), you just get it from her, rather than the mayor of Amalis. I'll confess that the only reason I've had Maggie in the party is when I'm testing out a build that's melee orientated - lest Val's awesome thumping skew my combat capabilities. Maybe it's the case that 3 of the 4 potential companions in Ch 2 don't have specific, character-only quests - much as Nell and Dante don't in Ch 1. It'll be interesting to see if Robert has more to add to his recuperation in the Valley of Silence story in Ch 3.<br/>\n<br/>\n As far as Sir William is concerned, I've picked him up purely for his quest (which, it appears, you can only get if he's in your party or you're a pally yourself), then dumped him back where I found him (nicking his gear first, naturally, but leaving him in some lord's attire - after all, a nude paladin loitering in a bar would look a tad odd.). He was just too pompous for my taste, and would annoy me to death. I had the same rejection issue with him as a CG character, but have had no problem as NG - which has become my default alignment in Aielund.<br/>\n<br/>\n I've also just realised that the character I've recently posted in the Full Epic forum is the first time I've <em>ever</em> (in 18 months) used a longsword build - there just seemed to be too many good ones to ignore.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Last time, as it was my first at these heady levels, I simply took it for granted that when I inherited Terinus, he was a perpetual L30 Wiz (still no bad thing), so it struck me as odd that he continued to level up to 34 this time (but not to 35). Equally, I thought, \"well Nellise has just got lots of cool new stuff and enhancements, so I can understand why she won't level up any further.\" Then, that was at L33, so this time I thought I'd get to 34 before capping her off - hence my earlier trip to the Ethereal Plane (I've done Twilight first both times). It was Robert that concerned me most. Nary a problem last time, but this time at levels 32, 33 and 34 I had a dialogue option to ask him to level up, which was odd in itself, followed by a yellow script line in the bottom dialogue box that read \"not scripted for level 32, (etc)\". Then suddenly, I level to 35 and so does he!<br/>\n<br/>\n In a way, it's of minor concern, given where we're all at, but if it's symptomatic of something else I don't know whether to go for a reload or not - particularly given the teething troubles I had in loading it in the first place. Aargh!<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh well, I'll finish Monk-Boy's run-through - which, btw, has been serene compared with my previous completion (further cementing Order of the Wyrm as one of my all-time favourite builds. Oh, and a quick question for my interest, Empyre, if I may: in the absence of OW and Dev Crits, how did you play the epic feats? I've taken 2 earlier GSTRs, but really ummed and ahhed about whether to take AS and/or EProw earlier) - then decide.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That is one benefit of frequent saves in SP play... reload when things seem amiss even though it may seem tedious to retrack.\u00a0 YOU have the control whereas on PWs, only the DM/admin has the \"power\" to adjust anomalies. So SAVE! Dammit! SAVE!<br/>\n<br/>\n I always place priority on <em>Epic Prowess</em> over the key ability bumps since EP = 2 Grt STR.\u00a0 In other words, EP gains in one level what Grt STR gains in 3.\u00a0 Sure, a bit more dmg but meh... hitting is where it's at (unless you are racing to qualify for DevCrit). But like Empyre pointed out, Armor Skin can rise above the to-hit significance when it's your toon getting hit too often to make much progress. Haven't checked the build you are using, but Expertise could mediate the problem as well (assuming your AB is adequate, naturally, and you have the feat).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n I like to read about on-the-fly content-specific build adjustments like these because they are a product of real-time experience and cannot be gleaned from a sample build.

After a couple of reloads when the same thing happened, I tried two more, both of which worked. It was all a question of intimidation. My current toon's a Barbarian for her first 8 levels, and Culdeny is reached at level 3, and if you don't level up (taking Intimidate, natch) until after you've spoken with Ronald Bartlett (apologies, I called him Robert last time), you're ok. Equally, if you do some more stuff (ie, helping the Rangers) and then talk with him at level 5, you're scary enough for rough questioning to work. It's just level 4 where the problem arises - too scary for him to patronise you, but not scary enough to cow him.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thus...hurrah!<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and the other build I'm taking through (depends on my mood at the time) has some Bard in him, and I've discovered a very mini Bard questette in Fairloch that has never been available to me before.

I will stress that it <em>is</em> tiny, and doesn't involve going anywhere else to complete it. In Fairloch's Market District there's a theatre (flagged on my map, but may not be on older versions. In case it's not, the theatre is on the street directly west of the inn where you find Sir William, and in the same position on that street). I'd been in before, and a rehearsal is taking place, but never had any joy in conversation (except for \"Go away, I'm busy.\"). This time, I was allowed to listen (in the same way you do when on the roof of the Host Tower in the OC - so be patient), before interacting.<br/>\n<br/>\n There are probably several solutions, but the build I'm using is a variation of the Elven Dragon Dual-Wielder you first provided me with 20 months ago and only has 3 Bard levels at this point (overall level 10 or 11), so I'm probably restricted in my options and their outcomes. What I do know is that the Bartlett family are probably never going to put me on their Christmas card list. I got some decent-ish loot (might be useful for your Persuasive Archer, but I can't remember if you've got Bard in that mix) and had no adverse reactions subsequently, so am hoping all is well.<br/>\n<br/>\n Hope this helps.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The particular build I've gone with here has some Persuasion skills, so I was actually able to complete the \"On The Waterfront\" sub-quest for the first time: and Bob's contribution had me in stitches. Any designer who can weave a Brando (Kasdan? Not sure) reference with \"The Wrath of Khan\" gets a huge hat-tip from me! I also liked his interaction with Dante - minimalist though it was.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Have just finished the saga for the 3rd time. I used a variation of Mick Dagger's <strong>Epic Brawler Champion</strong> (Fighter 18 / CoT 18 / Monk 4) - a brilliant melee build that may be found as build 196 in Hip's Fantastic Contrapulator.<br/>\n<br/>\n For the first time, I hit level 37. This both pleased and annoyed me.<br/>\n<br/>\n Pleased: because it's one more level than I expected - despite my forgetting to have a chat with Salinder in chapter 2 (which I think must give xp), and having no major character-specific side quests (I got Zach's Monk quest in chapter 3, but it's only a baby one). All of which means 37 is eminently do-able, with a full set of companions throughout (in this instance cleric and ranger in chapter 1, rogue and barbarian in chapter 2, rogue and cleric in chapter 3 - sorry Empyre, Bob was superfluous, and I won't tell you about chapter 4 in case you haven't played it.)<br/>\n<br/>\n Annoyed: because I'd spent way too long tinkering with Mick's build in its 30s - to the extent that I'd taken Monk 4 as a skills dump at level 32 (meaning, effectively, I'd lose +1AC from Tumble, rather than 2). Thus, at level 36, I thought I'd maxed what I could, sitting on Fighter 16 / CoT 16 (maxing my saves) and Monk 4, with both Armour Skin (taken at L34) and Epic Prowess (taken much earlier, at L24). Then...\"oh, what to do now?\". I was lucky, though - I could take level 37 as Monk and still get another 5 points in Tumble (another +1 to AC), which knocked the spots off everything else available - ie, nothing (I'm discounting an additional 2 HPs at this stage).<br/>\n<br/>\n I suppose what I'm saying, albeit going around the houses, is that it's worth building for level 37 in Aielund, rather than just 36. Admittedly, it only came within 2 minutes of the final battle, but - thinking of companions as much as anything (buffs, spells and the like) - you can still rest before going epic on the bad dude's ass, and a wee bit extra could make all the difference.<br/>\n<br/>\n Actually, while I'm here, I'm not entirely sure about chapter 4. There's a natural cohesion to the first 3 chapters, and indeed in the earlier elements of chapter 4. But after assorted regicides (actual and attempted), it starts getting a bit...silly. There are areas that could well produce good mods in themselves, and others you can't even enter. Now, this may be some extended foreshadowing, but is the final chapter of such an epic saga really the place to do that?<br/>\n<br/>\n Don't get me wrong, it's still a country mile better than any other SP game I've played, it's just that the last bit rankles a touch.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

And I'll try not to give away spoilers, for those yet to experience the saga.<br/>\n<br/>\n I think Part 4 (The Fall of Aielund) starts excellently (others will disagree, I'm sure). Sure, having all your hard-won cool gear taken away is a well-worn staple, but it is handled so much better here: there is plot purpose to it, and you don't just find all your old stuff lying around in a chest somewhere. It also forces you to think as a player. I don't know about you, but I was feeling a bit cocky in my abilities by the end of Part 3, and this was the slap in the face I needed to wake up again. The narrative remains 'realistic' and drives you forward, with moments of great pathos and humour thrown in. Then comes the twist with Osric, which was also handled very well.<br/>\n<br/>\n My moans (if they can be called that) concern events after being beamed into Terry's tower. I chose the word \"silly\" poorly, sorry, more like unsatisfying. Go througha series of doors to get bigger and scarier weapons? That doesn't seem to me as clever a plot device as Savant has demonstrated he's capable of. And he won't even let you go through a couple of those doors, so why have them there at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n As to what's behind the doors...Twilight has plenty of scope for a full storyline: we're given interesting characters and hints of back-story that could have been (and maybe are in the books) a prelude to a lengthy adventure in its own right. And then it's over. Hmm. The short trip to the Ethereal Plane is pretty inconsequential. I <em>do</em> like the tying together of things in Assumption, handled very nicely, even though the scraps with both Insidiae and Abadon left me feeling a little underwhelmed.<br/>\n<br/>\n Then there's the mind flayers - sorry saqarin (ye gods, how I detest them! I swear, ever since Baldur's Gate 2, whenever I encounter them a little part of my soul dies). Unlike every other baddies in the saga, their motivation for what they're about to do is piss poor. Surely creatures of their supreme intelligence wouldn't simply employ \"Hulk bash, Hulk smash\" tactics?<br/>\n<br/>\n There you go, those are my quibbles.

It's the seeming lack of imagination (for want of a better word) that leaves me a bit, \"meh\". It's a sandwich, where everything else has been a feast.

Certainly until well into the final part you won't find items above +5 enhancement, and you won't just find those ones lying around all over the place. It's just during the end-game that things escalate. Iirc, in part 1 (level 1-9) you're confined to +1s max, with a very occasional +2; part 2 (level 9-18) delivers more +2s and a few +3s; part 3 (level 18-24) sees more +3s and the odd +4 (if you get a +5, you'll have earned it); and up to about level 30 in part 4, +5 is the max.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I decided I'd head due south first - heading for the Skeletal Dragon (or Draco-Lich, my memory escapes me, but that's of little consequence at the moment), and have unsurprisingly encountered Scar, the ancient red dragon, en route. Now, here's my problem: I am not making any attacks whatsoever - just standing in front of him taking damage until I die. It's not that I'm missing him, I'm just not making any attempts at attacking. Nor am I a fraidy cat - wearing a hat that gives fear immunity.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm currently at DwD 10 / Fighter 7 / CoT 4 (overall level 21). My AB is 35/30/25/20 (with STR 20 +3 Belt +2 Gloves, WF and EWF in Battleaxe, wielding a +4 Battleaxe, Def Stance on). I don't get it - is it me, or maybe a wee glitch?<br/>\n<br/>\n Any help would be appreciated - and please let me know if you need more on the present state of the build.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>EDIT:</em> Perhaps I should say that I've tried reloading 4 times, and the same thing's happened (I also tried once using Heavy Flail +4 - 2 less AB, as haven't taken EWF in it yet - but that didn't work either). I'm also wearing speedy armour, so wondered if maybe I triggered the conflict too early (I was trying to get a lead over Robert Black and Criosa, so Scar would focus on me, thereby keeping them for harm and giving them greater attacking scope)?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Thanks both.<br/>\n<br/>\n The Scar scenario triggers thusly: entering the area directly south of Trinity you find yourself being\u00a0 walloped by columns of fire from the sky, roughly once every turn, with no discernable foe around. About two thirds of the way down the\u00a0 route to the exit, an enormous red dragon descends from on high and begind to batter you, with occasional fire breath thrown in. No starting conversation, just battle. Assuming all goes well, he dies - or at the very least flies away when down to \"almost dead\" status.<br/>\n<br/>\n This time, being the considerate soul that I am, I leg it speedy-style and wearing the ring of fire resistance towards the middle of the screen, thereby preventing my henchies being caught in fiery splashback en route. Scar makes his appearance and closes. I enter Defensive Stance...and stand there. The toon ducks and bobs, but does not take a single offensive action. Neither axe nor flail is swung in anger, despite my increasingly frenzied encouragement. Bob and Criosa arrive after a time. Bob gets scared. Criosa gets torched. I die. The end.<br/>\n<br/>\n Afraid DR isn't the issue. In previous trips he's been perfectly hit-able with +3 weapons, so +4 shouldn't be an issue. The combat log simply shows that I am not attacking at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'll try an earlier reload (which will be annoying, as I actually persuaded the Tusone emissary to go to the meeting with the Aielund dude for the first time) as Empyre suggests. I'll try going at normal pace as well (sorry, henchies), and see if that makes a difference. I'll let you know of progress or otherwise...<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Admittedly, that's a tougher way of doing it, but the reward is more xp, so all in all worth it. My hope was that, once I came back to Trinity, the problem would have sorted itself out...<br/>\n<br/>\n And it had - hurrah! So, a blessing in disguise, as I'm closer to level 23 than I would otherwise have been and have some better gear earlier on. Oh, and a very dead red dragon.

Spells have CLASSES. Fireball is a CLASS 3<br/>\n spell, learnable by a LEVEL 5 Wizard or a LEVEL 6 Sorc.<br/>\n<br/>\n R/L means \"1 round per caster level\". Likewise with T for turn and<br/>\n H for hour.<br/>\n 10/L means \"10 points per caster level\"<br/>\n N/2L means \"1 N per 2 caster levels\", i.e. +1/5L means +1 for L1-5,<br/>\n +2 for L6-10, and so on.<br/>\n (F/2), (R/2), and (W/2) after a spell's damage means a save of that<br/>\n type for half damage.<br/>\n A spell with damage listed as e.g. \"Ld4 B + Ld4 C(R/2)\" means that<br/>\n ONLY the cold has a Reflex save, and the physical has none.<br/>\n<br/>\n Anything noted as \"Correctly (per BW)\" means that a bug was fixed<br/>\n in BW's implementation relative to THEIR description of the spell:<br/>\n it may well be that the behaviour is not PHB, and often not even sane,<br/>\n but that's not the point.  :P<br/>\n It's very common for PHB to say one thing, BW to SAY another, and the<br/>\n BW code to DO a third. In those situations I've made judgement calls,<br/>\n generally favouring PHB first, BW's supposed behaviour second, and BW's<br/>\n actual behaviour last, because frankly they're just not very good at<br/>\n getting code right.<br/>\n<br/>\n The damage type abbreviations here are ABCDEFMNPS: Acid, Blunt, Cold, Divine,<br/>\n Electrical, Fire, Magical, Negative, Positive, Sonic.<br/>\n The very few spells that do Piercing or Slashing damage (Blade Barrier and a<br/>\n couple of others) have it spelled out, I hope.  :P<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ************************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n Global Changes<br/>\n --------------<br/>\n<br/>\n Spells use real saves. Treating a 1 as a failed save even if you beat<br/>\n the DC is beyond retarded. Want to kill a 60HD Epic Dragon with a level<br/>\n 11 char? Just Slay Living a couple of times and wait for a 1...<br/>\n Yes, I know this is the \"brilliant\" new 3E rule. It's still one of the<br/>\n most atrocious design decisions in history.<br/>\n<br/>\n Empower has been bugfixed. In NWN, 2d4 Empowered can be 12: roll 8,<br/>\n multiply by 1.5. 2d4 Maxed though is always 8. This is pretty clearly<br/>\n not how things should work.<br/>\n Empower is now (roll+max)/2, so it's always better than un-Empowered<br/>\n (which also isn't true in NWN); never better than Maximised; and on<br/>\n average is exactly the +50% it's supposed to be.<br/>\n<br/>\n Spell Resistance works correctly. Yes, it's broken in unpatched NWN:<br/>\n level 11 casters get resisted by SR12. SR checks are now shown as well.<br/>\n SR against your own spells also works correctly, but is not shown as<br/>\n it tends to flood the screen if you're in your own AoE's.<br/>\n<br/>\n Dispels work correctly. This is huge (not to mention unique in NWN. :P)<br/>\n<br/>\n AoE's work correctly. There is a known bug with ALL non-instant AoE's<br/>\n in NWN where their SP, DC's, caster level, and metamagic can (usually, do)<br/>\n become wrong as soon as any other spell is cast. For example, a Cleric<br/>\n who casts Blade Barrier and then Turns Undead will suddenly discover<br/>\n that the BB does 0d6 damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n Spells correctly handle Evasion and Improved Evasion.<br/>\n Creatures that are stunned, paralyzed, asleep, or petrified don't get<br/>\n to use Evasion. I mean, ffs. Yes, Evasion is Supernatural, but you're<br/>\n Helpless. YOU CAN'T MOVE *AT ALL*.<br/>\n<br/>\n Multi-target homing spells like firebrand and the Isaacs will only hit<br/>\n visible targets.<br/>\n<br/>\n The Bigbys will switch to a new enemy once their initial target dies.<br/>\n The new target must be visible to the caster, as this is a \"directed\"<br/>\n attack, not an automatic one.<br/>\n If the new target succeeds at an SR check, the Bigby is dispelled.<br/>\n Attempting to control multiple Bigbys of the same class at the same<br/>\n time reduces the duration of ALL of them because your focus is divided,<br/>\n and they will all expire when the oldest one does.<br/>\n While they still don't permit stacking they at least TRY to avoid<br/>\n completely wasting a second casting, by retargeting themselves if the<br/>\n original target already has the SAME class of Bigby active on it.<br/>\n Bigby 8 and 9 now face SR on EACH attack rather than just once. This<br/>\n avoids the absurd situation where a caster attacked by Bigby 8 gets<br/>\n stuck in a permanent loop of \"Fort Save, fail, stunned for 1 round\"<br/>\n because even a scroll-cast version of the spell is almost impossible<br/>\n to dispel. This way, if they manage to make the save they can at least<br/>\n cast a Mantle and absorb the spell on its next attack.<br/>\n<br/>\n Summons are T/L rather than H/L. You don't need to be a one-man party<br/>\n all the time if magic actually works.<br/>\n Summon VII+ correctly now include Earth elementals (BW use d3, oops :P)<br/>\n Summon I-IX cause a Battle of Wills unless cast from memory, regardless<br/>\n of the caster's class. If you lose, the creature will go hostile.<br/>\n Gate causes a Battle of Wills under ANY circumstances. You receive a<br/>\n +4 bonus if you are have a Protection From Evil, Aura Versus Evil, or<br/>\n Magic Circle Against Evil in effect, and a -4 penalty if you do not.<br/>\n Rogues Do Not Gate, and neither does an L3 Wizard with a scroll.  :)<br/>\n Planar Summons do not require a Battle of Wills since the creature<br/>\n is of your alignment and considers you an ally.<br/>\n Creating Undead requires a Battle of Wills unless cast from memory.<br/>\n Fixed an exploit where Munchkins could take a single Cleric level and<br/>\n the Animal domain to get improved summons as mages/Druids/etc.<br/>\n Fixed a bug with the various Shadow Conjurations summoning higher<br/>\n undead than they should (they share the script with Shadowdancers,<br/>\n so they were just using the casterlevel to determine the creature<br/>\n rather than the actual SPELL that was cast).<br/>\n<br/>\n Spells that require a melee touch attack (poison, slay living, etc)<br/>\n now correctly do the attack BEFORE checking SR.<br/>\n<br/>\n Charming does not work properly on NPC's at HC and above, so it has<br/>\n been converted to Daze on those difficulty settings.<br/>\n<br/>\n UMD no longer sucks (PHB is retarded and BW is even worse).<br/>\n To use the improved UMD rules, the x2_pc_umdcheck script must be added<br/>\n to your module separately. It has been moved from the EMS HAK to the<br/>\n Source Archive because of problems with NWN's search order for scripts:<br/>\n HAKs inexplicably take priority over module-specific scripts, so it<br/>\n would otherwise be impossible to override without creating *another* HAK<br/>\n just to put that in.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ************************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n Notes on Families<br/>\n -----------------<br/>\n<br/>\n Quite a lot of spells run in \"families\", i.e. several forms of what is<br/>\n essentially the same spell, but improving in one way or another as the<br/>\n class increases. Some of these families are utterly broken.<br/>\n<br/>\n For example: what do C3 Clarity, C5 Lesser Mind Blank, and C8 Mind Blank<br/>\n have in common? They're all exactly the same spell, and in a world where<br/>\n every NPC is Evil they're all massively inferior to the C1 Protection<br/>\n From Alignment.<br/>\n<br/>\n On the other hand you have the Elemental DR family, which is<br/>\n fundamentally solid except for a few small flaws:<br/>\n C1: Endure: 24H, 10/- to a max of 20<br/>\n C2: Resist: T/L, 20/- to a max of 30<br/>\n C3: ProtFrom: 24H, 30/- to a max of 40<br/>\n C5: EnergyBuffer: T/L, 40/- to a max of 60<br/>\n It really isn't hard to see what's broken there, is it?  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ************************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n HotU Spells and Weapon Enhancement<br/>\n ----------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n 1.62 introduced \"temporary item properties\" and spells to go with them:<br/>\n essentially, a way to make weapons +X, Keen, have bonus damage, etc.<br/>\n None of them work correctly in several important ways.<br/>\n The damage bonuses are done as spells, which means they don't do xN<br/>\n damage on crits; they don't activate Cleave if they cause a kill; and<br/>\n they can't ever be Dispelled. They also stack with each other, with<br/>\n a weapon's existing bonuses, etc: i.e. you can have a sword that does<br/>\n 2d6 Fire damage \"naturally\", and also 1d6+5 Darkfire and 1d4+10 Flame<br/>\n Weapon, for a grand total of up to 37! bonus damage on every hit. That's<br/>\n not counting Divine Might and Divine Favor, Bless Weapon, etc, which can<br/>\n take the bonus to over 60.<br/>\n As usual, most also have implementation bugs on top of everything else:<br/>\n e.g. Darkfire is supposed to go up to +10, but BW never could get math<br/>\n right.  :P<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm repairing these as time goes by, generally by changing the damage<br/>\n to fixed amounts (this is required by NWN engine limitations) based on<br/>\n caster level and fixing the stacking issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ************************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n Arcane Spells<br/>\n -------------<br/>\n<br/>\n Cantrips<br/>\n<br/>\n Resistance<br/>\n U+1, H/L, and +1/L to Conc and Disc<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Class 1<br/>\n<br/>\n Charm Person<br/>\n Is not the same as Charm Animal<br/>\n Correctly is considered a hostile action<br/>\n Duration raised to R/L<br/>\n<br/>\n Correctly is considered a hostile action<br/>\n Duration raised to R/L<br/>\n<br/>\n Color Spray<br/>\n Correctly does not affect Blind creatures<br/>\n Combines effects correctly<br/>\n<br/>\n Endure Elements<br/>\n 10/- ER, H/L, exhausted after 20/L of any given type<br/>\n<br/>\n Expedititious Retreat<br/>\n Per PHB is T/L<br/>\n<br/>\n Grease<br/>\n Per PHB has no SR (physical effect)<br/>\n Per PHB has a fixed DC of 10<br/>\n Per PHB lasts R/L<br/>\n<br/>\n Identify<br/>\n No longer stacks with Legend Lore<br/>\n<br/>\n Mage Armour<br/>\n Per PHB, +4 is all to ArmourAC<br/>\n Becomes +20 and R/L after L21 to act as a replacement for EpicMA, if caster<br/>\n meets the prereqs (C9's and 26+ SC) and is casting it on themselves.<br/>\n Two reasons for the EMA hack: first, NWN doesn't handle Epic Spell prereqs<br/>\n correctly; and second, +5 split across the different AC types tends to<br/>\n actually be +0 to everything but Dodge, because it doesn't stack with items.<br/>\n<br/>\n Protection From Alignment<br/>\n Duration is T/L per PHB<br/>\n<br/>\n Scare<br/>\n Fear for 1d4 R (W) or Shaken for 1R<br/>\n<br/>\n Shield<br/>\n Correctly gives a (duh) SHIELD AC bonus...<br/>\n<br/>\n Sleep<br/>\n Correctly does not affect creatures with 5 or more HD<br/>\n Per PHB is 4HD not 4+1d4, and T/L not R/L<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Class 2<br/>\n<br/>\n Ability Buffs<br/>\n Per PHB +4 rather than 1+d4, and T/L rather than H/L<br/>\n There's actually real value to casting these rather than drinking them now<br/>\n<br/>\n Belgaran's Iron Horn<br/>\n The DC of the Strength Check is 11+CasterBonus rather than a constant 20.<br/>\n Note that contrary to the spell's description, it's school is actually<br/>\n Enchantment not Transmutaion, and BOTH are wrong: should be Evocation.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n Cloud of Bewilderment<br/>\n This is just idiotic: it's Stinking Cloud again, only MORE powerful and a<br/>\n level lower.

Converted to Mass Invis.<br/>\n<br/>\n Magic Circle Against Alignment<br/>\n Duration is T/L per PHB, and hostile summoned creatures of, or summoned by<br/>\n someone of, the chosen alignment must succeed at an SR check or be banished<br/>\n (Technically, they should just be held at bay, but you can't really do that<br/>\n in any nice way in NWN)<br/>\n<br/>\n Mestil's Acid Breath<br/>\n Fixed inconsistent range<br/>\n<br/>\n Negative Energy Burst<br/>\n Successful Willsave also negates the STR damage<br/>\n<br/>\n Protection From Elements<br/>\n 30/- ER, H/L, exhausted after 60/L of any given type<br/>\n<br/>\n Stinking Cloud<br/>\n Correctly blocked by Poison Immunity<br/>\n Per PHB has no SR (physical effect)<br/>\n Per BW lasts 2R and save is rerolled every R even if failed<br/>\n<br/>\n Vampiric Touch<br/>\n THP duration is T/L rather H/2L<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Class 4<br/>\n<br/>\n Bestow Curse<br/>\n Correctly requires a successful melee touch attack<br/>\n<br/>\n Charm Monster<br/>\n Correctly is considered a hostile action<br/>\n Duration raised to R/L<br/>\n<br/>\n Confusion<br/>\n Hostiles only. Too many mods fall apart otherwise when PvP is on<br/>\n<br/>\n Contagion<br/>\n Correctly requires a successful melee touch attack<br/>\n Correctly has a Fort-negates save<br/>\n<br/>\n Elemental Shield<br/>\n As of 1.62, the OnHit retaliation is NOT OnHit, it's On*Damaged*<br/>\n which is a completely different situation and far less desirable.<br/>\n You have d4 HD. If you have to TAKE damage to DEAL damage, guess<br/>\n who's going to die first?<br/>\n BW have said it's highly unlikely they will ever fix this, so<br/>\n I've increased its duration to 2R/L so it delivers something<br/>\n resembling the number of retaliations overall that it used to.<br/>\n Damage has been split to 1d6+L/2 points of each of Fire and Cold.<br/>\n This is very slightly more damage than before, but also less damage<br/>\n overall against creatures with elemental DR.<br/>\n Note that OnHit retaliation ignores metamagic. Not a big deal here<br/>\n since the majority of its damage comes from caster level anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n Enervation<br/>\n Per PHB does NOT have a Fort Negates save<br/>\n<br/>\n Evard's Black Tentacles<br/>\n Duration now correctly (per PHB and even BW) R/L.<br/>\n Per PHB, creatures inside the tentacles move at half speed.<br/>\n Per PHB, there is no Fort save: you either resist the grapple or you<br/>\n don't. You are also NOT paralyzed, merely immobilized.<br/>\n The \"grapple check\" math is now correct and scales with the caster,<br/>\n and is also a true grapple. BW just had it as 5+d20 vs AC, which is<br/>\n why this spell has generally been considered a joke: the tentacles<br/>\n couldn't \"hit\" most creatures on anything except a 20.<br/>\n Per BW, the tentacles are +2 \"weapons\", so GV etc will NOT reduce<br/>\n the damage inflicted by them.<br/>\n Unlike BW, attacks are NOT combined, so DR is applied correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\n Fear<br/>\n Per PHB is Will Partial, not Negates: a successful save leaves the<br/>\n target Shaken for 1R. Caster is immune since this is supposed to<br/>\n be a cone emanating from them, not a generic splat.<br/>\n<br/>\n Ice Storm<br/>\n No save is nice, but, erm, it's weaker than fireball even when<br/>\n you first get it, and it gets weaker still as you get older.<br/>\n The caster causes giant hailstones to fall from the sky onto<br/>\n targets in a Huge area, to a maximum of 1 per caster level.<br/>\n Enemies nearest the epicenter are struck first.<br/>\n Each hailstone does 1d4B and 1d4C per 2L, with no save.<br/>\n All creatures in the area NOT directly struck by the hail,<br/>\n including the caster and her allies, are not Bludgeoned<br/>\n and get (R/2) for the Cold.<br/>\n<br/>\n Improved Invis<br/>\n Restores invis when not in combat, to make it usable for scouting again<br/>\n<br/>\n Isaac's Lesser<br/>\n Can be targeted, does 1d4+1 per missile, does SR correctly,<br/>\n chooses targets correctly.<br/>\n<br/>\n Phantasmal Killer<br/>\n Fixed a huge bug where mindspell-immune creatures could still be<br/>\n killed by this: any time a spell's save and its effect don't match,<br/>\n BW's scheme falls over completely.<br/>\n Creatures who fail the Will save but succeed at the Fort save are<br/>\n shaken for 1R rather than damaged.<br/>\n<br/>\n Stoneskin<br/>\n Also confers immunity to Critical Hits (and implicitly, Sneak<br/>\n Attacks) as do Greater Stoneskin and Premonition.<br/>\n<br/>\n Wall of Fire<br/>\n Per PHB is R/L not R/2L<br/>\n Per PHB is 2d6+L damage not 4d6+0<br/>\n Per PHB is double damage to undead<br/>\n Per PHB does NOT have a Reflex Save<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Class 5<br/>\n<br/>\n Ball Lightning<br/>\n Correctly has an R/2 save<br/>\n Correctly does damage in ONE chunk<br/>\n Basically, BW totally screwed it up trying to get pretty visuals<br/>\n so it was actually a Electrical Missile Storm, which meant 5/- DR<br/>\n would consume the whole thing since it was L * 1d6 rather than Ld6.<br/>\n Converted to an area spell because it obviously should be one.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cloudkill<br/>\n Correctly only affects living, correctly uses poison immunity<br/>\n rather than deathmagic immunity, correctly damages &lt;=6HD when<br/>\n they enter the cloud, correctly applies any vsAlignment etc<br/>\n bonuses when saving.<br/>\n SHOULD BE: creatures &gt;6HD take -1d4CON/R(F/2), not some\ttrivial<br/>\n non-amount of acid dmg. HOWEVER, CON drains don't stack in 1.62<br/>\n which makes that useless. Have changed it to do -4 CON on entry<br/>\n and d6 points negative damage per round, duration is R/L.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cone of Cold<br/>\n Range is now correctly 60ft<br/>\n<br/>\n Dismissal<br/>\n Correctly no longer dismisses friendly summons on HC+<br/>\n Has the correct DC<br/>\n<br/>\n Dominate Person<br/>\n Duration raised to T/L (it should be an HOUR per level! but that<br/>\n would kinda suck in SP  :P)<br/>\n<br/>\n Feeblemind<br/>\n Correctly also drains CHA. Still uses the BW 1d4/4L scheme rather<br/>\n than nuking them to 1, because spellbooks fall apart otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\n Firebrand<br/>\n If not nerfed, this spell makes ALL other C5's worthless.<br/>\n Huge range, Huge damage, huge number of targets, no selfdmg:<br/>\n why get close enough to use CoC when you can just hurl this?<br/>\n L arrows to a max L of 15, doing d6/L damage to a max L of 10.<br/>\n AoE now correctly Colossal rather than Gargantuan.<br/>\n Still an absolutely monstrous spell.<br/>\n<br/>\n Lesser Mind Blank<br/>\n H/L, also removes Fear<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Class 6<br/>\n<br/>\n Acid Fog<br/>\n Correctly (per BW) does 24 damage on enter when maximised<br/>\n Per PHB has no SR (physical effect), no save, and lasts R/L<br/>\n Per PHB obscures sight: 100% miss chance on ranged attacks<br/>\n<br/>\n Bigby's Forceful Hand<br/>\n Correctly (per BW) causes 1d8 B damage. Includes caster bonus in<br/>\n the bull rush check because otherwise it has no value as a spell,<br/>\n only as a scroll.<br/>\n<br/>\n Chain Lightning<br/>\n This spell's design is fundamentally flawed.<br/>\n Secondary damage needs to be at least 10d6 rather than L/2 d6.<br/>\n An L12 caster does 12d6 primary but only 6d6 secondary under the<br/>\n original spell, whereas the standard Lightning Bolt will do 10d6<br/>\n to all targets. Realistically speaking, Chain is SIGNIFICANTLY<br/>\n WEAKER than Bolt despite being 3 classes higher, and even worse<br/>\n off when compared to a C3 Fireball which doesn't have LOS<br/>\n restrictions.<br/>\n Given that this spell has to compete for slots with IGMS; Tenser's;<br/>\n the Greater forms of Breach, Dis, and Stoneskin; Ethereal Visage,<br/>\n and more (C6 has by FAR the best combination of spells overall,<br/>\n arguably more so than even the C9's) there is simply no point in<br/>\n this spell even existing, as it is today.<br/>\n Considering that a Cone of Cold does 15d6 to ALL its targets and<br/>\n is a class LOWER, there is no justification for Chain being so much<br/>\n less effective. Damage is Ld6 to ALL targets now, but capped at 10d6<br/>\n for secondary targets. This preserves the \"spirit\" of the original<br/>\n spell, but without the crippling defect.<br/>\n<br/>\n Circle of Death<br/>\n AoE is correctly Colossal rather than Large.<br/>\n Correctly doesn't try to slay constructs.<br/>\n<br/>\n Flesh to Stone<br/>\n Correctly fails against creatures with Stoneskin.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n Legend Lore<br/>\n This rather pathetic spell (erm, HALF the bonus of Identify? Huh?) has<br/>\n been completely overhauled.<br/>\n If cast on yourself it functions as the BW version, except that you<br/>\n receive the full bonus to Lore rather than half.<br/>\n If cast on an item though, it does something rather fun...  :)<br/>\n You study a single item intensively, with the intent of divining and<br/>\n possibly altering some of its magical properties.<br/>\n The degree of success is determined by your caster level and any<br/>\n relevant bonuses (ability modifier, Divination focus, etc) against a<br/>\n base DC of 11 plus the item's value in KGP<br/>\n DC11: the item is successfully identified, regardless of its value<br/>\n DC $: you make the item usable by your class<br/>\n DC $+2: you make the item usable by any class<br/>\n DC $+5: you make the item usable by your race<br/>\n DC $+7: you make the item usable by any race<br/>\n DC $+10: you make the item usable by your alignment<br/>\n DC $+12: you make the item usable by any alignment<br/>\n This spell does not in any way alter the mundane properties of the item:<br/>\n a suit of Full Plate is still Heavy Armour, and cannot be equipped unless<br/>\n you have the requisite proficiency no matter how you alter its magical<br/>\n properties<br/>\n<br/>\n Isaac's Greater<br/>\n Can be targeted, does 1d4+1 per missile, does SR correctly,<br/>\n chooses targets correctly.<br/>\n Yes, 1d4+1. Deal with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n Tenser's Transformation<br/>\n Per PHB, plus the caster is given a Greatsword of the appropriate level<br/>\n since it's retarded to expect them to lug one around just for this.<br/>\n (Gnomes and Halflings get a Longsword).<br/>\n L11: +2, 1d6 M<br/>\n L14: +3, 1d6 M<br/>\n L16: +4, 1d6 M<br/>\n L18: +5, 1d6 M<br/>\n These values will let the caster equip the item even if ILR is on.<br/>\n The bonus damage is M rather than F, as it just makes more sense.<br/>\n There is a known but minor issue with resting while Transformed:<br/>\n you will be left with the GS (although it will have become mundane<br/>\n at least) unless the module actually advances the game clock, which<br/>\n standard NWN does not.<br/>\n If you are using these scripts in your own module, calling<br/>\n SpecialisedDispel(OBJECT_SELF, SPELL_TENSERS_TRANSFORMATION) in the<br/>\n OnPlayerRest script will also take care of the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n Undeath To Death<br/>\n No longer TMI's if you have more than about 12 undead in range<br/>\n Slays targets outright rather than damaging (which fails if they have DR)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Class 7<br/>\n<br/>\n Banishment<br/>\n Correctly no longer banishes friendly creatures on HC+<br/>\n Gives the appropriate XP reward for any outsiders banished. If the<br/>\n moron classes get XP for hitting things then casters should get XP<br/>\n for actually playing like mages.<br/>\n<br/>\n Bigby's Grasping Hand<br/>\n Can now \"grapple\" creatures immune to paralysis: BW's implementation of<br/>\n BigbyIX suggests that this is the correct behaviour<br/>\n<br/>\n Control Undead<br/>\n Duration now T/L<br/>\n<br/>\n Delayed Blast Fireball<br/>\n Correctly only triggered by HOSTILES on HC+ rules<br/>\n Before 1.62, there used to be a little glowy effect where the DBFB was<br/>\n that seems to have been removed, which kinda sucks  :(<br/>\n The trigger area for this spell is utterly microscopic. Don't blame me:<br/>\n I can't fix that.<br/>\n<br/>\n Great Thunderclap<br/>\n Can not be cast if the caster is Silenced (fixes a loophole bug where it<br/>\n could still be cast from items)<br/>\n Does not affect creatures in zones of Silence, except for the shockwave<br/>\n<br/>\n Mordenkainen's Sword<br/>\n The sword cannot be damaged, only dispelled<br/>\n Does 4d6 damage and is a +3 weapon with one attack per round, per PHB<br/>\n Note: it is NOT subject to WoF as it is a plane of force, not a creature<br/>\n<br/>\n Power Word Stun<br/>\n Like all spells, this wasn't designed to function at epic levels.<br/>\n As a result, it becomes less useful than even the C1 Color Spray,<br/>\n which CAN stun a 22HD creature.<br/>\n Thanks to the THP bug, Enervation and even EnergyDrain don't help.<br/>\n The HP limit basically makes it yet ANOTHER \"Fort Negates\" spell,<br/>\n like EVERYTHING above the C5 Hold Monster is. gg Fighter-only NWN.<br/>\n So here's how you fix it:<br/>\n You can stun up to 10HP per caster level for 1d4 rounds. For every<br/>\n 50pts over you are, you get an extra 1d4 rounds.<br/>\n See how easy that was?  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n Prismatic Spray<br/>\n Range is now correctly 60ft<br/>\n Non-scaling spells are conceptually flawed, so the Blindness now affects<br/>\n creatures of &lt;= 1/2 your caster level rather than &lt;8HD, and its duration<br/>\n has been lowered to 2d4 R per PHB. The Reflex effects are now<br/>\n 1: Ld2 Fire, 2: Ld4 Acid, 3: Ld8 Electricity<br/>\n Most of the other effects are now per PHB<br/>\n 4: Poison, 1d6 CON if you SAVE, and DEAD if you don't<br/>\n 6: Insanity, which is permanent until magically removed<br/>\n 7: Death, is by Planar Shift: Death Magic immunity will NOT save you<br/>\n 5 is still Paralysis per BW, because petrification sucks, but the duration<br/>\n has been raised to R/L rather than just 10R<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Class 8<br/>\n<br/>\n Blackstaff<br/>\n This is the worst spell in history. Completely redesigned.<br/>\n You bring a shimmering stafflike plane of force into existence,<br/>\n similar to Mr Pointy. The staff's attack bonus is equal to your<br/>\n caster level plus your INT/CHA bonus, with an additional +4<br/>\n enhancement bonus. It deals 1d6+4 points of damage per hit,<br/>\n with a threat range of 20 and a critical multiplier of x2.<br/>\n The staff is a significantly inferior combatant to Mr Pointy,<br/>\n but makes 2 attacks per round rather than 1, and on a successful<br/>\n hit will attempt to Dispel Magic on the target, at your caster<br/>\n level.<br/>\n The staff cannot be harmed by physical attacks, but is subject<br/>\n to Dispel Magic, Dismissal, Banishment, etc. For Dismissal, the<br/>\n staff's Will save is the Will save of its creator at the time of<br/>\n the staff's creation.<br/>\n<br/>\n Horrid Wilting<br/>\n Water ellys take double damage per PHB. Caster is immune per BW.<br/>\n Damage is 1d8 per caster level to a maximum of 20, not 25.<br/>\n<br/>\n Incendiary Cloud<br/>\n Per PHB has no SR (physical effect)<br/>\n<br/>\n Mass Blindness/Deafness<br/>\n Enemies only. Also note that BW has this in the wrong school.<br/>\n<br/>\n Mind Blank<br/>\n H/L, all allies in Colossal area, also removes Fear<br/>\n<br/>\n Mass Charm<br/>\n Correctly is considered a hostile action<br/>\n Correctly charms all Monsters, not just Humanoids<br/>\n Per PHB, always attempts at least one creature regardless of HD<br/>\n Duration raised to R/L<br/>\n<br/>\n Premonition<br/>\n I've got nothing against adding to or improving on the PHB spells,<br/>\n but this \"Uber Stoneskin\" is just dull. Let's make it fun.  :)<br/>\n You gain the ability to see a few moments into the future.<br/>\n This grants you a +2 bonus to Reflex Saves, DodgeAC, and Initiative.<br/>\n You are never flat-footed, and can frequently avoid melee attacks<br/>\n completely.<br/>\n Duration changed to T/L<br/>\n<br/>\n Sunburst<br/>\n Correctly blinds non-vampiric undead.<br/>\n Uses a single throw for half-damage and voiding blindness,<br/>\n as opposed to BW's two-throw version (which is easier, but wrong).<br/>\n Damage has been increased to d8, as there's basically no reason<br/>\n to use it otherwise: at d6 it has the same damage as a DBFB, but<br/>\n is a slot higher, and a lot of undead (mummies etc) take 150% fire<br/>\n which generally makes this a worse spell overall without that.<br/>\n Note: since HOTU added Undeath-To-Death, this spell is almost<br/>\n completely pointless anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Class 9<br/>\n<br/>\n Bigby's Crushing Hand<br/>\n Correctly uses the target's STR for the grapple check: BW used<br/>\n the caster's.  :)<br/>\n Note that this is a real Grapple check, and the numbers are correct,<br/>\n but they're insanely high: the Hand has 35 STR (+12) and is Large (+4)<br/>\n so even a BAB20 Fighter is going to have a very hard time with it.<br/>\n<br/>\n Black Blade<br/>\n Now has the correct feats.<br/>\n Does NOT require concentration.<br/>\n Is a +5 weapon that gets one attack per round, causing 4d6+5+2 damage<br/>\n per hit, with a critical threat of 17-20x2.<br/>\n The sword's AB is now correct, though limits in NWN mean it will not<br/>\n quite get the full AB it should when cast at high levels.<br/>\n The rift DC now actually works consistently.<br/>\n The rift now has the correct DC (10+9+casterbonus) rather than BW's<br/>\n 10+casterlevel. This stops rogues from creating DC27 Slay weapons<br/>\n from scrolls.<br/>\n The sword's SP is now correct.<br/>\n The FIRST time the sword strikes a creature with SR, it must succeed<br/>\n at an SP check or is dispelled.<br/>\n Note that being sucked into a Planar Rift is a physical effect:<br/>\n Immunity to Death Magic will NOT save you from it unless EMS_SOFT_DEATH<br/>\n is enabled.<br/>\n<br/>\n Dominate Monster<br/>\n Duration raised to T/L (it should be an HOUR per level! but that<br/>\n would kinda suck in SP  :P)<br/>\n<br/>\n Energy Drain<br/>\n Per PHB does NOT have a Fort Negates save<br/>\n<br/>\n Gate<br/>\n Fixed a bug where the Gate was delayed twice (6s rather than 3).<br/>\n As with other summons, you must win a Battle of Wills to control<br/>\n the Balor. If you are protected at the time you open the Gate,<br/>\n you receive a +4 bonus on the Battle. If you are NOT protected,<br/>\n you receive a -4 penalty.<br/>\n Note that BW use a pathetic Balor of roughly half the real one's<br/>\n level for a \"hostile\" Gating. I do not.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n Meteor Swarm<br/>\n This is supposed to be Ice Storm's big brother, but it's LESS<br/>\n effective. It doesn't scale with the caster; it has an R/2 save<br/>\n that translates to no damage for Evaders and 10d6 *at best* for<br/>\n ImprovedEvaders.<br/>\n Creatures within 6ft take no damage? Players move nearly 60ft<br/>\n in the time between you casting a spell and it actually firing.<br/>\n Where the hell do you think the guy ATTACKING me is by then?! <br/>\n It's just terribly designed, plain and simple.<br/>\n The caster causes giant meteors to fall from the sky onto<br/>\n targets in a Colossal area, to a maximum of 1 per caster level.<br/>\n Enemies nearest the epicenter are struck first.<br/>\n Each meteor does 1d4B and 1d4F per L, with no save.<br/>\n All creatures in the area NOT directly struck by the meteors,<br/>\n EXCLUDING the caster herself but including her allies,<br/>\n are not Bludgeoned and get (R/2) for the Fire.<br/>\n Yes, I know that's 40d4 at level 20. Wilting is 20d8 and a<br/>\n class lower, and not subject to DR.<br/>\n<br/>\n Mordenkainen's Disjunction<br/>\n Has so many bugfixes I couldn't list them all.<br/>\n In a nutshell, it works correctly now: every case, every combination.<br/>\n I preserved the BW opposed roll, because otherwise any newb with a<br/>\n scroll could strip an L90 Mage naked with it, which is clearly wrong.<br/>\n Always removes all temporary weapon properties (Darkfire etc) regardless<br/>\n of what the roll is.<br/>\n See the notes at the end of this file for some evil new functionality<br/>\n that you can optionally enable in your module.  &gt;:)<br/>\n<br/>\n Power Word Kill<br/>\n Same basic design problem as PWS. Here's how you fix it:<br/>\n You can kill up to 6HP per caster level.<br/>\n See how easy that was?  :)<br/>\n The AoE aspect (something BW added) is ridiculous. 20HP?!<br/>\n If fired as an AoE it just selects the nearest visible hostile<br/>\n within 15ft of the target location.<br/>\n<br/>\n Shapechange<br/>\n Too many fixes and improvements to list. It no longer totally sucks,<br/>\n but it's still not great.<br/>\n<br/>\n Timestop<br/>\n Is MP-friendly and suitable for PW's<br/>\n Per PHB lasts 1+d4 R and caster can take no hostile actions while time<br/>\n is stopped (or if she does, they have no effect) with an exception for<br/>\n dispels and breaches<br/>\n Fixes (technically, bypasses) an engine bug where the ordering of<br/>\n effects created during a TS is incorrect<br/>\n<br/>\n Wail of the Banshee<br/>\n Counts targets correctly. BW \"charges\" for ALL creatures rather<br/>\n than just those it tries to slay (i.e. hostiles).<br/>\n Range is correctly 40ft, not 30.<br/>\n Creatures who save still take L+3d6M damage - this is an AoE FOD,<br/>\n and it should act like one.<br/>\n<br/>\n Weird<br/>\n Per PHB, and nothing like BW's (which is a defective non-spell)<br/>\n   Anything &lt;=4HD dies<br/>\n   Anything that fails W dies<br/>\n   Anything that's still alive takes 3d6 M, is stunned for 1R,<br/>\n     and takes d4 STR damage for 10R<br/>\n Note that Weird is a Fear spell: Immunity to Death Magic will NOT<br/>\n save you from it unless EMS_SOFT_DEATH is on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ************************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n Epic Spells<br/>\n -----------<br/>\n<br/>\n Such a farce. The whole \"Epic Magic\" desperately needs some actual DESIGN<br/>\n effort put into it, but here are quick fixes for the two offensive spells.<br/>\n<br/>\n Save DC is now CASTER level plus caster bonus. Even DEX 8 Clerics can make<br/>\n the Reflex save on Hellball under the stock rules, because Epic Spells have<br/>\n LOWER DC's than normal spells.<br/>\n They can also benefit from PHB Metamagic now.<br/>\n<br/>\n Hellball<br/>\n Uses all 5 elemental damage types rather than 4, but is still pathetic.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ************************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n Divine Abilities<br/>\n ----------------<br/>\n<br/>\n Turn Undead<br/>\n<br/>\n Creatures that have already been turned are no longer turned over and<br/>\n over again. This is a huge benefit: since turning has a HD limit, those<br/>\n creatures continue to drain HD from the cleric's total turning ability<br/>\n under the BW implementation, thereby stopping multiple turnings from<br/>\n actually affecting any new or stronger creatures.<br/>\n<br/>\n Turned creatures have their movement speed halved. This is more a case<br/>\n of fixing bugs than anything else:<br/>\n If you're attacking something with a fear effect in NWN, the game tends<br/>\n to move you close to the target, then stop you, then move the creature<br/>\n away, so you never actually get to ATTACK it even if you're hasted<br/>\n and it's a zombie. Even worse is that creatures that are knocked down<br/>\n magically spring up and run away, and it's just SO annoying.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Divine Might/Shield<br/>\n<br/>\n Are now correctly Supernatural, which stops them being removed by Dispels<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ************************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n Cleric Spells<br/>\n -------------<br/>\n<br/>\n Cure Wounds<br/>\n<br/>\n Correctly have W/2 when used as attacks on undead.<br/>\n Correctly damage undead with POSITIVE energy, not negative.  :)<br/>\n Are Maxed on Easy and Amped on Normal, rather than Maxed on both.<br/>\n Fixed an exploit where Munchkin Druids could take a single Cleric<br/>\n level and the Healing domain to Amp all their Druid Cures.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Class 1<br/>\n<br/>\n Bane<br/>\n Correctly is considered a hostile action<br/>\n<br/>\n Bless<br/>\n Applies effects at correct location (BW always used caster)<br/>\n Has correct duration when cast on bolts <br/>\n<br/>\n Doom<br/>\n Correctly has Will negates<br/>\n<br/>\n Divine Favor<br/>\n Damage type is (duh) Divine rather than Magical<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Class 2<br/>\n<br/>\n Silence<br/>\n Per PHB lasts T/L not R/L<br/>\n Correctly grants immunity to sonic damage to ALL creatures:<br/>\n BW only does hostiles, which means it helps them but not you!<br/>\n Correctly DOESN'T silence the caster, so you can actually USE<br/>\n the spell now. ffs...<br/>\n Would now actually work if cast as an AoE, except NWN doesn't<br/>\n let you use it that way since BW screwed their implementation up<br/>\n so badly. You can fix this by changing SPELLS.2DA to allow it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Class 3<br/>\n<br/>\n Darkfire<br/>\n Completely rewritten to work at least somewhat decently<br/>\n<br/>\n Glyph of Warding<br/>\n Correctly only triggered by HOSTILES on HC+ rules<br/>\n Correctly does not remove Invis/Stealth/etc from caster when triggered<br/>\n Has the correct DC, SP, etc (all the standard BW AOE bugs)<br/>\n On entering the Glyph's AOE, creatures make a Spellcraft check, DC11 plus<br/>\n the caster level of the Glyph's creator. If they succeed at the check, they<br/>\n are assumed to have detected and disabled Glyph rather than triggered it.<br/>\n<br/>\n Prayer<br/>\n Works correctly when cast at a location or on someone other than<br/>\n the caster. If cast on a creature, moves with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n Searing Light<br/>\n Correctly does d8/L to vampires<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Class 4<br/>\n<br/>\n Divine Power<br/>\n STR is +6 per PHB, not \"always 18\"<br/>\n Increases Discipline by 1/L, though it's fairly meaningless since<br/>\n IKD etc have such a broken design<br/>\n<br/>\n Hammer of the Gods<br/>\n Per PHB does Ld6 to Outsiders and L20+ Monks<br/>\n<br/>\n Neutralize Poison<br/>\n Correctly also grants T/L immunity<br/>\n<br/>\n Poison<br/>\n Correctly requires a successful melee touch attack<br/>\n Correctly has a Fort-negates save<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Class 5<br/>\n<br/>\n Circle of Doom (Mass Inflict Light Wounds)<br/>\n AoE is Large: matches Healing Circle (was Medium)<br/>\n<br/>\n Flame Strike<br/>\n Correctly hits ALL creatures with the fire portion on HC+<br/>\n<br/>\n Healing Circle (Mass Cure Light Wounds)<br/>\n See \"Cure Wounds\" fixes above<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Class 6<br/>\n<br/>\n Harm<br/>\n Per PHB inflicts up to 10HP/L and is capped at 150HP.<br/>\n Under normal circumstances, Harm will never kill a creature:<br/>\n if the damage caused would be fatal the creature is reduced to 1HP<br/>\n instead. However, targets that are unusually susceptible to<br/>\n Negative Energy may in fact be killed.<br/>\n Note that Harm DOES have a save: it's Will for half damage, same<br/>\n as every other \"Inflict XYZ Wounds\" attack.<br/>\n Munchkin Clerics are going to hate me forever...  :(<br/>\n<br/>\n Heal<br/>\n Per PHB cures up to 10HP/L and is capped at 150HP.<br/>\n Removes all harmful effects that Restoration can, as well as Disease<br/>\n and Poison.<br/>\n Correctly gives an Amp bonus (+50%) to Clerics with the Healing domain.<br/>\n Correctly has W/2 when used as an attack on undead.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Class 7<br/>\n<br/>\n Destruction<br/>\n Same as everything else: spells that don't scale with the caster are<br/>\n fundamentally bad design, especially when you're talking about 10d6<br/>\n damage even when it's a Rogue using a scroll. There isn't really a<br/>\n good way to fix this without nerfing it for real casters too though,<br/>\n so damage is now d4 per level with no cap.<br/>\n<br/>\n Greater Restoration<br/>\n As Heal, but also removes Charm, Confusion, Curse, Daze, Domination,<br/>\n Fear, Slow, Stun, and true permanent negative levels (i.e. ones caused<br/>\n by an Energy Drain - this is the ONLY way to remove such negative levels<br/>\n other than a successful dispel against them) and is capped at 200HP.<br/>\n Note that it can NOT be used as an attack against Undead.<br/>\n<br/>\n Word of Faith<br/>\n I'm not really sure how this ended up so utterly broken. I think it's<br/>\n because the Luskan Captains in CH4 cast it a lot, so it was hacked up<br/>\n specifically for the OC.<br/>\n Correctly (per PHB WoC, and BW themselves even!) does NOT blind.<br/>\n Correctly per PHB WoC gives summoned creatures a W-4(N) save.<br/>\n Correctly does NOT banish MrPointy (a plane of force is not a creature).<br/>\n Correctly per PHB WoC applies the effects based on RELATIVE level<br/>\n rather than absolute.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Class 8<br/>\n<br/>\n Aura vs Alignment (Holy/Unholy Aura)<br/>\n AC and Resistance bonuses are correctly vs Everyone.<br/>\n Be careful: the icons are a little confusing, as they're the inverse<br/>\n of the Protection From Alignment ones: Holy Aura is \"vs Evil\".<br/>\n<br/>\n Earthquake<br/>\n Correctly affects all creature, not just those in line-of-sight.<br/>\n d8 damage for every 2 caster levels, max 10d8, R/2.<br/>\n No creature other than the caster can move or attack for one round.<br/>\n 1% chance per caster level of opening a fissure beneath an enemy<br/>\n (second Reflex save to avoid that, automatic fail if they already<br/>\n failed the first save) for another d8/2L damage (PHB says instant death:<br/>\n be thankful for my kindness. :P)<br/>\n<br/>\n Fire Storm<br/>\n Actually applies the Divine damage to Evaders who only save vs the *Fire*<br/>\n Nice bug - no wonder it's always felt so weak.  :)<br/>\n<br/>\n Mass Heal<br/>\n Heals 10HP/L and is capped at 250HP<br/>\n Correctly gives an Amp bonus (+50%) to Clerics with the Healing domain<br/>\n Correctly does not require a touch attack when used against Undead<br/>\n AoE is correctly (per BW) Large<br/>\n<br/>\n Sunbeam<br/>\n Correctly blinds non-vampiric undead.<br/>\n Correctly does double damage to vampires.<br/>\n Uses a single throw for half-damage and voiding blindness,<br/>\n as opposed to BW's two-throw version (which is easier, but wrong).<br/>\n Damage isn't increased to d8 like Sunburst, because Clerics DON'T<br/>\n have always-superior spells at this level or below like mages do<br/>\n with DBFB and Wilting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Class 9<br/>\n<br/>\n Implosion<br/>\n Per BW, an instant effect with no limit on creatures killed<br/>\n (PHB is 1 per round to a max of 4 and requires concentration)<br/>\n As with Wail, creatures who save still take L+3d6M damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ************************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n Paladin Spells<br/>\n --------------<br/>\n<br/>\n Bless Weapon<br/>\n Can not be used to create Rakshasa-slaying bolts: only Bless does that<br/>\n<br/>\n Defeaning Clang<br/>\n Removed OnHitCastBS<br/>\n Damage scales at +1/2L to a max of +5, and duration is T/L<br/>\n<br/>\n Holy Sword<br/>\n Is self-only<br/>\n Correctly dispels at your Paladin level<br/>\n Grants SR roughly equal to your Paladin level, though the atrocious \"design\"<br/>\n of the item property system makes it a bit iffy<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ************************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n Druid Spells<br/>\n ------------<br/>\n<br/>\n If you're wearing metal armour, which is anything other than Cloth or<br/>\n Light, any spell you attempt to cast will AUTOMATICALLY FAIL.<br/>\n I don't care that BW incorrectly gave you Medium Armour proficiency,<br/>\n or that you can MC to Fighter and run around in Full Plate with no<br/>\n side-effects. EMS is about fixing bugs, and that's a bug. Deal with it.<br/>\n You're lucky you don't lose all spellcasting for 24 hours, which is<br/>\n the real rule.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Class 1<br/>\n<br/>\n Charm Animal<br/>\n Is not the same as Charm Person<br/>\n Correctly is considered a hostile action<br/>\n Duration raised to R/L<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Class 2<br/>\n<br/>\n Barkskin<br/>\n Per PHB is 1+1/3L. Still H/L, though it should really be T/L<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Class 3<br/>\n<br/>\n Call Lightning<br/>\n Correctly only targets visible enemies<br/>\n Correctly only targets one enemy per level, to a max of 10<br/>\n (Placeables are freebies, because I'm kind and unlocking/bashing<br/>\n them is dull as hell)<br/>\n<br/>\n Infestation of Maggots<br/>\n Duration is correctly R/2L<br/>\n Correctly requires a successful melee touch attack<br/>\n Unlike all the other broken HOTU \"single-cast\" spells, this one is<br/>\n STAYING single-cast, because it's a retarded Munchkin spell.<br/>\n It should probably be changed to just deal damage instead.<br/>\n Can no longer reduce CON below 4 or kill the target: it's absolutely<br/>\n outrageous to give creatures Death Spells this early.<br/>\n<br/>\n Quillfire<br/>\n Another BW spell, another disaster.<br/>\n This is the same class as Poison. It does Poison AND damage.<br/>\n Seriously, does anybody there even PRETEND to design this stuff?!<br/>\n Now requires a ranged touch attack; damage type is piercing; damage<br/>\n is d8+L/2 with the cap removed; and there is no poison.<br/>\n<br/>\n Spike Growth<br/>\n Correctly checks for SPIKE GROWTH effects to avoid stacking, BW checks<br/>\n for Greater Magic Fang. Way to use constants guys.  :P<br/>\n Duration dropped to R/L: permanent AOE's, which is essentially what<br/>\n this is, are incredibly bad for the engine.<br/>\n Duration of Movement Speed Decrease dropped to 1 Turn: PHB says the<br/>\n effect is removed by any Cure spell, so anyone would simply drink a<br/>\n Cure Minor and be rid of it immediately. NWN requires Restoration,<br/>\n which is far too \"expensive\" for such a low-level spell.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Class 5<br/>\n<br/>\n Inferno<br/>\n Behaves more like Combust: the target gets a Reflex save each round<br/>\n to negate the spell; the damage is 1 point per caster level to a max<br/>\n of 15; and it can be cast at a target more than once.<br/>\n<br/>\n Owl's Insight<br/>\n Removed<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Class 6<br/>\n<br/>\n Crumble<br/>\n Genuinely has no SR<br/>\n<br/>\n Drown<br/>\n Typical BW-created disastrous excuse for a spell.<br/>\n Nothing should EVER do stupid things like \"90% of HP\". It's the same<br/>\n crap as BW's Harm: take a 700HP Ancient Dragon and instantly turn it<br/>\n into a Goblin with a retarded Munchkin spell.<br/>\n Reimplemented as 1d6 per caster level to a max of 15d6 or half the<br/>\n target's current HP, whichever is lower; and F/2 rather than Negates.<br/>\n Also fixes a bug in BW's where the damage was susceptible to DR.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Class 7<br/>\n<br/>\n Creeping Doom<br/>\n Correctly has no SR (BW has SR on first round but not others)<br/>\n Correctly has no movement speed decrease (BW's constant copy+paste<br/>\n from Acid Fog means virtually every AOE they did has that...  :P)<br/>\n Correctly per PHB is constant damage per round (1 point per level)<br/>\n not BW's retarded scaling damage, and has no damage limit.<br/>\n Stop whining you sadcase Munchkins: if this was a REAL implementation,<br/>\n it would be 20 bites at 1 damage each, so any amount of DR would negate<br/>\n the entire thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Class 8<br/>\n<br/>\n Bombardment<br/>\n Really shouldn't have SR or a save, but it's BW's creation so blame them.<br/>\n Note that contrary to the description, the damage is actually capped at<br/>\n 10d8 rather than 20d8; and it targets ALL creatures, not just enemies.<br/>\n I've raised the cap to 15d8 and left the rest of it unchanged.<br/>\n<br/>\n Nature's Balance<br/>\n SR drop works correctly<br/>\n<br/>\n Premonition<br/>\n Druids cannot cast this spell, and never should have been able to.<br/>\n It makes no sense at all, and was a side-effect of BW turning<br/>\n Magical Foresight into just \"Even Greater Stoneskin\".<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Class 9<br/>\n<br/>\n Elemental Swarm<br/>\n 4T/L rather than 24H<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ************************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n Bard Spells<br/>\n -----------<br/>\n<br/>\n Class 4<br/>\n<br/>\n War Cry<br/>\n Damage bonus now Sonic rather than Slashing: so many things have DR for<br/>\n physical damage that it basically doesn't do anything otherwise, and this<br/>\n is one of the very few Bard spells that doesn't utterly suck to begin with.<br/>\n Also, the Fear effect has been raised from a constant 4R to R/L, and<br/>\n creatures who succeed at the Will save are still shaken for 1R.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ************************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n Monster Spell-Abilities<br/>\n -----------------------<br/>\n<br/>\n Virtually all of BW's monster abilities are broken: defective math,<br/>\n wrong creature, wrong duration, missing save, wrong DC, etc etc.<br/>\n Fixed so far: auras, gazes, howls, cones, tyrant fog zombie / ghast,<br/>\n bolts.<br/>\n Not fixed yet: pulses, dragons (aura, breath, wingblast),<br/>\n krenshar, salt mephit, steam mephit, stink beetle.<br/>\n Howls now correctly do not penetrate zones of Silence.<br/>\n<br/>\n Petrification spells and abilities now fail against creatures with<br/>\n Stoneskin. The combination of the defective 1=autofail saves, no SR,<br/>\n ignoring mantles, and no immunity to petrification meant that just<br/>\n 2 or 3 basilisks in a room was a guaranteed death, even for L40 chars.<br/>\n Cockatrice Petrification Touch Attacks now NEED TO SUCCEED AT A<br/>\n TOUCH ATTACK FIRST. BW scripts suck SO much.  &gt;:(<br/>\n<br/>\n Hell Hound Breath now scales with the creature and has R/2 save.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ************************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n Other Stuff<br/>\n -----------<br/>\n<br/>\n Familiars<br/>\n<br/>\n Auldar's uberpanther has been replaced with a ShadowDancer. If you want a<br/>\n Power-Attacking, KD'ing, 10d6 Sneak Attack killing machine you should be<br/>\n using Summon Creature. The panther is also now your level rather than +1.<br/>\n Per PHB, familiars get their master's Will Save (if it's higher, and it<br/>\n would be shocking if it wasn't).<br/>\n Can only be fed once an hour, and only heal Ld6 HP. Giving them a full heal<br/>\n whenever you feel like it is an exploit. If you can't take better care of<br/>\n them you deserve to pay for the potions. To compensate, and to remove the<br/>\n annoyance of having to micromanage their health, they now regenerate 1HP/R:<br/>\n it won't keep them alive longer in combat, but it means that low-level mages<br/>\n don't have to constantly re-feed after every fight, or use potions that they<br/>\n can't afford.<br/>\n<br/>\n There are some optional enhancements in the EMS *source* archive that have<br/>\n been left out of the HAK as updates to the Pausanias AI could potentially<br/>\n break them: a \"scout ahead\" command in the familiar's conversation, and<br/>\n a command to use Shadow Evade (panther familiar, level 5 or higher). These<br/>\n are in nw_g_fam.dlg. There is also a fix to the henchscout.nss script to<br/>\n stop scouts from teleporting across the map.<br/>\n Note that if you're building a mod that uses both the Pausanias HAK and<br/>\n the EMS HAK, you MUST give EMS priority, as the Pausanias AI contains two<br/>\n spell scripts (dismissal and banishment) that use BioWare's defective SR<br/>\n and saving throw routines.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Shadow Evade<br/>\n Is now correctly Supernatural, which stops it being removed by Dispels<br/>\n Lasts 5 or DEXMOD rounds, whichever is higher<br/>\n AC also increases by 1 per 5L after 10<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n ************************************************************************<br/>\n<br/>\n Additional Notes<br/>\n ----------------<br/>\n<br/>\n Mordenkainen's Disjunction has an option to enable actual PHB-style<br/>\n disjunction. VERY cool stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\n If you set the ModuleInt \"EMS_DISJOIN_TIME\", Morks may disjoin magic<br/>\n items for that many rounds. The chance of this happening is your<br/>\n caster bonus vs d100, for EACH equipped item on the target.<br/>\n Unlike PHB, these effects occur only on targeted castings rather<br/>\n than for all items in the area.<br/>\n This is the only way a Mage has ANY chance in PvP with all the uber<br/>\n items and Munchkin Belts of Immunity to Everything Magic EVAH!!!11!<br/>\n Castings from scrolls have a 0 bonus, and thus cannot destroy items.<br/>\n The recommended duration is 10 rounds, i.e. the same length of time<br/>\n as the SR drop that Mord's causes; the default duration is 0, because<br/>\n by default the Int does not exist.<br/>\n If you set the value to -1, any disjoined items will be IRREVOCABLY<br/>\n DESTROYED.<br/>\n<br/>\n This is really just intended for PvP play, but I would LOVE to see an<br/>\n SP mod use it sometime...  :P\n</div></blockquote>\n\n Thats quite extensive, will require some reading!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

So, for example, you could start off as a good Monk, take some Rogue, then at level 14 commit yourself to a career as an Assassin by being naughty in advance of your next levelling-up. But you couldn't start in the same way, then take some Pally, then take Assassin, without losing your Pally privileges.<br/>\n<br/>\n I could be wrong, but that's what seems logical to me (as far as logic goes in these circumstances).<br/>\n<br/>\n Just as a suggestion, why not try a playthough \"as is\" first, then decide if you want/need to bugger around with the spells? <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Tried the first few challenges in Chapter 1 both solo and with henchies, and the xp was constant, so hurrah!<br/>\n<br/>\n However, interestingly enough, for the first time, retrieving the mayor's documents from the naughty halfling lass in Bracksworth didn't trigger an attack: she just got a bit huffy, but no violence. Wulgar Ironbow is clearly a force not to be trifled with - even at level 1! (That was in the \"with companions\" encounter.) That said, it was a little annoying not to get the xp and coin (I know it's minuscule amounts in the grand scheme, but early on little things matter) - so I popped back in to see if she'd changed her mind and wanted a ruck, but no, still merely grumpy (and, playing LG, it just wouldn't feel right killing her anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I wondered if it was a glitch, but she responded after recovery of the documents (saying something like, \"I see you've found them, now please leave my home.\").

At the next level-up (6), My intention was to open his options by giving him autonomy to decide which form of attack he'd prefer at the time (the AI has worked very well with that previously). At that stage, I'll have both WS feats, PBS and Rapid Shot, so can be more adaptable myself. But I'll have to check whether his feats have improved his bowmanship as they would normally have done, or whether he's gone on a different tangent (I noticed he didn't take WS at Fighter 4, so we'll just have to wait and see). I already have Nellise (Cleric 5) making her own choices, but this will stop soon, and I'll have her concentrate on her crossbow attacks, buffing and other spelly things.<br/>\n<br/>\n Don't get me wrong, this isn't a complaint, just something different. I'm having to manage myself differently with Wulgar, so I suppose it makes sense to be doing the same with my team. The only annoying thing is that by the time I've got these henchies mastered (level 9) I'll have to swap them for a different pair. Hey-ho.<br/>\n<br/>\n BTW, Hip, I've tweaked Wulgar's skills distribution a little (not the totals for each skill, just the order I'm taking them), taking all the Lore points early - handy not paying for identification when money's tight - along with enough Spellcraft to net me a +1 v Spells pre-epic and a few earlier Persuade ranks. It means Listen suffers a little, but I know my henchies (or thought I did!), and they can compensate for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Quick update. Just deaded wyverns and gone to level 6. Dante continues to level as Fighter. And what feat did he take? Great-bloody-Cleave. This, when he's sitting on PBS but no WF (let alone WS) in longbow. Idiot. Mind you, with his Fighter levels, I can now kit him in some good heavy armour. Swings and roundabouts, eh?<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></em> Blow me down - I'm spectacularly avatared! Thanks for the \"how-to-not-be-so-thick\" instructions!<br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT 3:</strong></em> Now at level 7, and what's he picked as his Fighter bonus feat? Imp Initiative. Luvverly. Oh, and I'm pleased to be away from page 13 of this thread. Rodent's monumental citation is very useful, but it does strain the poor old eyes!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

But hells, no - this stocky wee fella inspires you to trust him. I'm hardly ever feeling like I have to do a hatchet job, now - which, as a natural-born meleer takes some doing. Currently at level 9 (and yes, Dante continues as Fighter - having taken Imp Power Attack and Imp Crit: GSword at the previous 2 levels. I suppose 1 decent feat from 2 isn't too shabby.

But there is always a cost, right?\u00a0 The finessed handaxe will suffer a 3AB loss but it's still quite unusual to have a decent attack with piercing, slashing AND bludgeoning damage. It's important to retain KD vs. mages else they will match your artillery with some nasty ranged stuff of their own.<br/>\n<br/>\n But without the axe being part of the character's background, it just doesn't seem right somehow.\u00a0 Wulgar has a tale to tell and chucking stones at passers-by was never part of it.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I had contemplated taking mace rather than handaxe, but decided his back-story made a compelling case for hatchet, and iirc there are some arrows that also inflict bludgeoning damage somewhere (serves me right for not paying much attention to ranged stuff in the past).

Once he was down, it was a simple mopping-up exercise.

When all are paralysed,  you can break cover and complete the kills.<br/>\n Beware that you cannot hide when in combat. You have to stop the attack before you hide. I do that by assigning the attack icon from the circle menu to a hotkey. I do the same with the stealth icon. I press the two hotkeys is quick succession to abort attack and hide.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I had thought about reloading a save prior to ballsing-up, but decided to bite the bullet. A shame in some ways, Predator is a great bow - certainly the best longbow in chapter 2 (comp lbow +3, Mighty+4, Massive Crits 1d10, Woodland Stride). I've kept it with me into Chapter 3 (I'll confess that I also invested 30k in its giving me 16 SR) as my \"ordinary\" bow, and purchased a comp lbow +4, Mighty +5 (not available in Chapter 2) for my cache of \"special\" arrows. I'm sure something else will come up, but this seemed like a reasonable compromise for now.<br/>\n<br/>\n My current problem is that Robert Black is my only melee support. I'm sure Criosa would be willing (mad thing that she is) to assist, but throwing a single rapier-using Rogue/Wiz into the heart of battle seems ill-considered at best (leaving aside the fact that she's the princess I've promised to keep safe). I'm not letting Robert dual-wield currently - first, because it's a sod that he wields bastard swords; and second, because I want him as AC-heavy as I can get him. This, naturally, means I'm not as AC protected as I'd like to be, but DwD is very helpful with that in a tight spot, such as the duergar mobs we've just been playing with in Stoneguard, and things will improve markedly when I hit level 22 and get some Tumble kicking in (sorry, Hip, I delayed HS1 by 1 level for an extra Tumble AC point). Of course, before that stage I'll have to decide whether to give Robert the speedy armour or not, because I'll be wearing better DEX (thus AC) gear by then (probably at level 20).<br/>\n<br/>\n I digress, sorry. Yes, you can modify the Pally's prep as you suggest - I just forgot to do it. D'oh. Although, to be fair, they both disregarded me completely when I told them to defend me and not attack until I did, so who knows what would have happened. However, Sir William proved an excellent companion in the assault on the palace, so all was grand.<br/>\n<br/>\n You might have noticed that I haven't reported back on the Kama-Shinobi. That's because I got it horribly wrong. Several times. I will get there, but I think a few wet towels on the head are needed first, so I'll get Wulgar and co. back to Culdeny before I attempt it again - sorry, Mick.</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It'll be fascinating to see the differences.<br/>\n<br/>\n Frankly, so early in the story, not giving xp for that cunning wolf was just mean. Oh, and I don't recall seeing any kobolds throughout the saga.<br/>\n<br/>\n I get what you say about the alignment-affecting dialogs, except it's a pig of a thing that you get 50xp for whichever option you choose as well as the 1pt shift - be it Lawful, Chaotic, Good or Evil - because you get zip xp with a Neutral response, and NG is my preferred option (given the choice). In Culdeny (in chapter 1, anyway), when I find I've drifted a little far from my 50 on the lawful-neutral-chaotic axis I just pop down into the crypt and take something from a tomb, which triggers a 1pt shift to chaotic each time. This means I can give a few lawful responses for the xp, all of which helps early on, and then go re-balance myself. What's also nice about the xp for such responses is that even when you hit the 100%, rendering the shifts useless, you still get the 50xp, so still handy.<br/>\n<br/>\n In my current excursion, trying to finalize my re-tooling of GDL's Hearth Guard, I suspect we're running about level so far.

Later on, when weapons go beyond +2, I simply remove and sell it, but he does seem to like that one.<br/>\n<br/>\n I think I mentioned earlier that Sir William has proved an excellent companion, but was a let-down on the Isle of the Dead, which was where I expected him to shine - it's the Abyssal Spectres that he's particularly rubbish with as a tank - unless appropriate orders have been given, because of their repeated appearances.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Unfortunately, I can't ask them without breaking the sanctity of the spoiler, damn it! Guess I'll just have to give a whirl sometime. As a predominantly melee player, in Ronan's absence I find a Rogue very valuable to have along, so I've kept Criosa for that more than anything. I'm less bothered by her Wizardly arts - Nell is fully able to deal with buffing and other such duties - and, of course, Terry is a very handy late addition. Monsieur Noir is growing on me as I go on, but - for the aforementioned reason - I tend not to need two big boys up front, so use him rather less. The same should be true of Val in Chapter 2, but Maggie's a Druid, and they're, well...weird (oh, I can feel the thunderbolts even now...). And Sir Bill simply ain't got the looks. Not that there's any shallowness going on here, oh no indeedy.<br/>\n<br/>\n Ah - and I have to start your Kama-Shinobi again soon (along with Hip's Wulgar and the conceptual Bullroarer Took). But must finish the re-jigging of GDL's Hearth Guard first. Just started Chapter 3 with him - the chapter of many dragons. Am even now umming and ahhing about whether to take Bob or Nell with the blondie princess.

If so - or even if not - the southernmost, at least, may be worth remembering for your return from Trinity...<br/>\n<br/>\n Did you encounter the ancient red dragon, Scar, in the area just south of Trinity?

The final battle of Part 1 was particularly interesting. Unfortunately, I was the only one left standing by the end of it (bar Criosa, who I'd parked up near where we first came in). Nell took an unlucky early sneak/crit and went down, and Dante did his best as meat shield, but followed her into the abyss not long afterwards. This left me, Robert Black, 9 Steel Tigers and one remaining spy (I'd concentrated my early fire on taking down the sorcerer). The gun-and-run approach proved very effective, even outpacing the mounted Mr Black, who was the last to die. It took a long time, so I missed out on some of the loot, but was well worth it for the practice in a different playing style. And I was able to raise Nell and Dante, which assuaged some of my guilt at their demises. I now begin to see how soloing Part 1 could work.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm now in Part 2, at level 11, with Ronan and Sir William. We've done the University, Cathedral, Admiralty and Library, and I'm now wondering whether to drop the pally for Valennia before dealing with the docks and heading into the sewers. Both have their plusses and minuses. I'm also using the Daiyku+3 longbow and the bracers of archery (which grant WS in longbow), which together with only 2 levels of AA, have considerably boosted my strike/damage rate.<br/>\n<br/>\n It's all a very different experience from playing Wulgar - the only other archer build I've attempted. Not better or worse, just different...</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

While on the first level of the mines of Stoneguard (working for King Sulinus) in Chapter 2, I came upon a \"tiny crack\" I hadn't noticed before, together with a dwarf standing beside it. He told me another worker had vanished into it. The crack itself indicated that it could only be accessed by a halfling, gnome or pixie. Now, it so happens that I chose pixie as my familiar when taking my one level of Wiz (so far), so I summoned her. There was no dialogue option for her to go into the crack, so I thought I'd possess her. I managed that successfully - without guidance! But I still can't get access into the crack. Does this mean I'd have to dump my henchies in order to go in, or am I just clueless about familiars? (It is the first time I've had one.)

Have just completed said battle, and for the first time let Cadmus look after himself - which he spectacularly failed to do. The sword is really helpful: I'd hung on to Lightbringer for Nell, but it seems the \"post-dead\" goodies she keeps for you are random, so lost it. She did get the Angelfyre scimitar from Celeste, but this sword and the Heavy Xbow of imminent speedy death (or whatever it's called) have given her an excellent armoury.<br/>\n<br/>\n I ummed and ahhed about taking Criosa or Robert Black (I'm playing a girlie), but decided on a girl power party for now. The princess has Deathwind as her shortbow and the Tactical Rapier as melee weapon. I've taken Thunderstrike from Dante for myself (just levelled to 28). I've sacrificed some Monk abilities by wearing Armour of the Night, but given that there's no decent gear for monks at the moment, and that this armour grants haste anyway, I'm not really losing out with an AC of 47 and AB of 49, tied with a ridiculous reflex save (the other two are not exactly shabby either).<br/>\n<br/>\n I did forget that Gaston (back in Myrfell) doesn't do ranged weapons, so had to settle for a big-ass kama instead.

You do get a stupendous greataxe from Reikthor's twice dead body, and an amulet from Talon that's very handy for Robert in the final part (only useable by evil/neutral). You also get the 5000 xp from Morik, but nothing else (other than the promise of aid),<br/>\n<br/>\n I did as I've done a few times previously: Criosa gets killed a lot without special attention, so I just left her there and did it with me and Nell. Had to remember to resurrect her on the way back, though. I did notice that the xp gained from killing one of the undead (?) changes from 80 per kill to 90 when I'm without the princess, so companions do make a difference at this stage of the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n I followed your hinted at advice - first time I haven't taken the archers with me from Trinity - then realised I'd hardly any arrows left.

After you answer the first riddle, in addition to those super-nice monk gloves, the dragon offers a bow that is even better than Zen. Later, she offers a Monk robe, but I can tell you that 35 UMD is not enough to be able to use it.<br/>\n<br/>\n After so many battles being unusually tough, presumably because I am an archer, the battle with Abaddon went really well. We won on the first try. The battle with the Dreadnoughts was a little bit tougher, but not too bad. The battle with the commander, who didn't used to have that armor, nor did he used to summon that big spider thing,  was brutal. To win, I had to continuously feed heal and epic heal potions to the other party members like they were water. It's a good thing that I had hoarded so many.  I didn't get to do much fighting myself.

I also got the monk robes (being a Monk AA UMD wasn't an issue), which I'll give details of once I've found where I've written them down. I've also taken on board your tip of hoarding the epic heal potions rather than divvying them up early and have the others fritter them away. Oh, and I'm now Mrs Black! Blimey - you kill a man and this is where it gets you...<br/>\n<br/>\n Am about to go confront Abaddon now, at level 35 and sitting on an AC of 71, with an AB of +66 etc. It would have been better, xp-wise, if I'd managed to save any of the Tusone archers earlier on, but I sadly failed in that. I decided to bite the bullet rather than reload, figuring I could make up the loss during the Battle of Fairloch - no other ranged competition.

Some of you may recall I had a problem with a Dwarven Defender and the dragon, Scar, in Part 3, just south of Trinity, in that my PC wouldn't attack. I believe the consensus was that it was a problem with Defensive Stance. But it ain't. I'm currently barrelling through with Valerfor's Iron Fist Monk (Monk 35 / Fighter 5), and the same thing happened again. It would appear that while Scar is perfectly prepared to stomp on those of a Dwarven ilk, he's not prepared to suffer the indignity of an attack from one of them. I solved it this time by Benny Hill-ing him, leaving Robert Black to knock him into a week on Wednesday (for those not knowing Benny's work, his TV shows invariably ended with him running around at top speed being chased by a gaggle of comely wenches). This has only happened when I've played a Dwarf - anyone else had the same?<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, the sword Stormbringer. I haven't paid proper attention to the inscription on its hilt before, but now I find myself wondering: is it a tribute to Michael Moorcock's Elric of Melnibone and his sword of the same name (twinned with Mournblade, if I recall)? Or to Deep Purple's album/song of that name - or indeed Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow?

This is for two reasons: first, I thought Valennia would be over-egging the greatsword-wielding warrior-woman pudding a touch, what with Ren being one as well; and second, I wanted to see how she performed while having only one proper front-liner in the party (me).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I'm not sure whether this is Aielund-specific or applies more broadly, but Maggie will not use a sling with a shield equiped (she's fine with a dagger).

We're now on the way to Amarillo - sorry, Amalis (even though the song's now fixed in my head) - and she's using a large shield when she feels like it, so I've given up trying to understand her. I did have to have a word about her squandering her spells: Ice Storm and Lightning Strike for two orc archers seemed a tad extreme...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Save the world any day, not for the benefit of all, but to further yourself and grab the opportunities you create for yourself, no matter if it causes others to suffer. And if you remove other villains, that only opens up new doors for yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvil spoiler:<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>\nIf you don't mind the alignment shift towards evil - and you don't - you are now free to slay commoners, and city guards for xp and items to sell. And it doesn't break anything plot-wise as long as you don't remove guards that are there to open doors/gates for you to advance quests. They turn hostile when you attack, but their perception range is limited, so only the ones closest to the one you attack \"turn red\". And after a couple of minutes they turn non-hostile again if you run and escape. Then you can talk to them again, like nothing happened. They must have very bad memory. \nA warning though: The empty streets, inns and bars feel very empty and spooky when you have killed everybody...</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

So few points in Concentration will not make a noticeable difference. It would be like trying to rely on 12 points of Discipline to protect yourself from being knocked down. Putting those points in Lore would be less useless, or maybe a few of them in Appraise, like at levels 7 and 12.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Sorcerer would work w/ Blackguard if I wanted to be THAT guy. But why Fighter/CoT when Paladin gives me better saves, the Divine Feats of CoT, and does so taking up fewer spellcasting levels? Ranger/Wizard can be fun (sorcerer less so, because there are too many stats required to make it work). But I typically end in something w/ AA. And I just played an Arcane Archer a few months back, before I knew this version came out.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nRanger/Wizard/CoT is not terrible. But other than minor save boosts, I'm not sure what CoT gives me there, given that again to make the build work, I have to dump CHA, so the Divine Feats are pointless. (Let alone I hate dropping XP in Aielund because of failed persuades. I've already done it too many times with this Wizard.) If I were doing this, I'd probably drop SD on top, take the 5 levels for ED, and choose Undead, Constructs, and Outsiders as my FE. That's 10 lvls of Ranger, 5 of SD, 22 levels of Wizard, (assuming lvl 37, which is where I typically max at). Less than 9 of Ranger makes no sense anyway because I'd want the IDW, so might as well take 10 and get the 3rd FE, which is entirely justified for RP anyway. Hmmm. It's not terrible. But I think I'm giving up way too much spellpower for the joy of 2 weapons.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nOTOH, with the Black One as the primary nuker, I could go straight buffs, summons, and no-saves. For all the AI nastiness in Aielund, the number of times I've actually seen Mords thrown is fairly small. (The Tower w/ Veronica, the Black One himself before that, and the final battle...once I think?) Might work. I'd either be light on heals or tanking in Act 3. But nothing I didn't do before w/ a Wizard, Criosa, and RB.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

A quality spellsword, viable throughout the Saga (because I refuse to be carried by my companions) that isn't another Paladin/Sorcerer. I can make a good arcane trickster. But that's Criosa.

Not sure it would be enough to avoid total stun lock in the end. Though there is always mind blank.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd oh yes, I've partied with Nell many, many times. :P Buffed she's a more than serviceable tank. Especially if you choose a certain sword for a tomb reward. OTOH, EMS nerfs the duration of a host of buffs substantially across the board, and cleric more than wizard, IIRC. And watching for those to drop is harder on henchies than me. That said, the rest timer is now down to an almost \"Why\" level in the newest version. (6 minutes) I have yet to clear a level and have to wait out the timer, as I did in the caves of part 1 when you'd slog past Umber Hulks, Hook Horrors, and Dire Spiders to be rewarded with wyverns. :P Which is fine with me, I vehemently disagree with rest timers. It's not like fighters don't outstrip wizards for damage output already.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

When I went to exit from the Merc hideout to the Mountain pass the load screen didn't progress even after reloading the game and trying again several times. I experienced the same issue in the abandoned mine trying to exit to the Calespur Mountains. There, I could go back the way I came and exit back into the Calespur Ranges. When I went up into the mountains the entry into the mines was dead with no transition. I didn't worry too much about it but when I came to an impasse at end of the merc hideout I decided to open the toolset to investigate. It looks like there is no corresponding area transition in the Mountain Pass area to the merc hideout. I tried adding an area transition in the cave entrance in the mountain pass but the toolset gives me an \"access violation\" message. I guess the problem may be with conflicting hak\u00a0files based on nothing other than I can't think what else it could be. Any suggestions? I see there is a thread on Beamdog where Savant answers questions but he seems to get an awful lot of them so I thought I'd ask here first.

I've been travelling with her in my current run-through with Empyre's Katana Master (Fighter 10/ Bard 8/ WM 22), and she's awesome. Her AI even compensates for my own inadequacies - like if I forget to sing a tune before a battle she'll barkskin me and otherwise buff me without asking, which is nice. She only casts firestorms and lightning strikes against frost giants, saving her icestorms for other foes. I've equipped her with the Hide of the Grizzly for a boost to strength when in melee (for which her massive dagger is fine), otherwise the elite druid armour.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe also has some cracking lines.

Basically, when creating an NPC in the toolset there are some pre-leveling packages that assign specific feats based on the level of the character and the package choice. So, if a package had a cool name like \"dual-wielder kensai\" or something similar and the creator of the module thought \"that sounds perfect for this guy\", then an automatic choice was made and the character got all those feats. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do not know for sure that this is exactly what happened here, but that would be my rough estimation based on other NPC's I have seen in the past.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

As soon as I presented him with the Arc Draconis (with me taking the trap hit to recover it for him - and he still failed his fear roll) he started dual-wielding immediately - I should have told him beforehand. Never mind, I did it all by my little self. This WM lark is quite fun after all. That said, I did make a mess of freeing the hidden dwarves - I was bringing Criosa back to life (she'd run off like a jackrabbit to confront 3 duergar wizards before I could stop her) when a nasty berserker I'd missed came and killed the poor dwarf before I spoke with her.

This earned me some xp.\nI let Nellise meet her father, but did not involve her in any of the combat in Hell. That was worth some xp and a cool happening.\nI let Terry do his thing to destroy the saqaarin base after I had cleared it.\nIt was not possible to avoid mass combat with NPCs taking part In the battle at Highmarch against the Ironlord. But I was able to defeat all the constructs that spawned at the hillside south of it. The rangers there only put up a minor resistance, so it was almost solo. There was also a skirmish outside of Trinity when I first met the king.</details>\n\nI used run'n gun tactics a lot. Rapid shot was almost always active. But I also used other tactics. Especially in pre-epic levels I also used traps, and even killed some bosses with stacked traps. I did some melee fighting as a back up plan, both with Gloves and Kama. An earlier Weapon Finesse would have helped, but in the pre-epic game the difference was not as bad as one might think when I put on my strength gear and swallowed a Bull's potion. <br/>\nI was able to get a high AC throughout the game, and seldom missed Discipline. I often had success with point-blank shooting, as long as I could use choke points to avoid being surrounded. The Called Shot routine to slow down single attackers was one thing I used very little. That was simply because of the speed my character had, and the other options with traps and close combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for equipment:\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>\nThere are some very good bows in the game. They scale well with the item level in general. Monk items and caster items are plentiful and very good, so I seldom missed UMD. There are bracers that improve ranged combat with WF, WS, EWF and EWS for both Shortbow and Longbow. So I never missed those Fighter levels.</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The bracers I bought in Amalis in Act 2 are a godsend, with GMW (15), Stoneskin, and even Spell Mantle in a pinch. Oh, and +2 Dex. They're \"only usable by Sorcerer\", but they are a UMD rogue's wet dream at the point you get it.<br/>\nThe armour I got from rescuing the linguist is still the only permahaste item I have. It really shows how useful the property is - I'm using it even tough I could already get +3/+4 AC from UMD monk robes (depending on Criosa's Cat's roll). I respect modules that don't throw permahaste in your way with a high hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does seem like you can have at least 4 party members. I have now reached Culdeny and have a fourth companion (the metalhead). I also believe that so far whatever could be solved diplomatically has been solved diplomatically, including the frost giants and The Pass.<br/>\nControlling a party in a game very much not designed for it is difficult, even with the shortcut commands. Mostly because in this game, first strike means so much*. In the Undercity I found myself having an easier time stocking my companions at the stairway and scouting and fighting ahead on my own. This way my friends did not set off traps I was in the middle of disarming and did not wander off in 3 directions at once, pulling every enemy on the map. I did call them for the boss, they got stuck in the doorway while I did the fighting :) (I do have the party move tool hotkeyed, but it was not an overly difficult fight)<br/>\n<br/>\nGoing to sleep just before doing some plumbing in Culdeny.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Example: attacking a wizard with high level spells and you have more than 3 attacks per round. If you get first strike, for all intents and purposes you have a 399/400 chance of knocking the wizard down, and you win. If the wizard gets first strike, it's time stop / mord's / time stop / GS / buff time, and that's really not what you want.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

(actually, seven)), paying attention to the extra files and where they go.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter action report: I have reached the first decision that looks like it will actually impact what is to come. I'm talking about below Fort Highmarch. It made me stop and think, and I love that. I took the conservative option, not wishing to turn the world as people know it upside down just before a major battle, and because I'm more concerned about being able to do something the act's title character than playing Truman Show with the fort's commander. I did save before the decision, and I'll check out later how the other path plays out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe road back to Highmarch definitely had its moments of brilliance. First of all, the idea of doing your Act 1+2 trek backwards is fantastic. Seeing how the world changes is one of my favourite things in rpg's and Aielund very much hits the nail on the head here. The trading company quest (very \"Biowareish\" in philosophy) in Culdeny was hilariously entertaining. This is how you do a FedEx quest without boring the player.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe elves have a lot of extra reactions if Spartan is in your party (they know him(?)). Again, the dialogue writing is a bit college-y at certain points, but the module has such huge momentum that I didn't really mind. Come to think of Spartan, he didn't fully grasp the idea that people generally keep dogs, not wolves, as pets.<br/>\n<br/>\nNever having played a Fighter/Rogue/WM7 before, I'm very happy with the build. I know it's a classic, and even though I had to sacrifice skills to get bluff/intimidate/persuade (and thus I went with Dex 18 Int 16 Str 12 and three 8's), it still rocks, very dodge-and-weavey playstyle, very strong in melee. It's also going to be my first character with ED (but it will come late in the module). I always thought it's not that much to dodge a single attack against a single opponent per round, and I wonder why it's the holy grail of Dex builds, but I hope my opinion will change when I see it in action.<br/>\n<br/>\nTime to go and save the day. Although a quick glance at Act IV's title tells me that's not going to happen.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

(actually, seven)), paying attention to the extra files and where they go.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter action report: I have reached the first decision that looks like it will actually impact what is to come. I'm talking about below Fort Highmarch. It made me stop and think, and I love that. I took the conservative option, not wishing to turn the world as people know it upside down just before a major battle, and because I'm more concerned about being able to do something the act's title character than playing Truman Show with the fort's commander. I did save before the decision, and I'll check out later how the other path plays out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe road back to Highmarch definitely had its moments of brilliance. First of all, the idea of doing your Act 1+2 trek backwards is fantastic. Seeing how the world changes is one of my favourite things in rpg's and Aielund very much hits the nail on the head here. The trading company quest (very \"Biowareish\" in philosophy) in Culdeny was hilariously entertaining. This is how you do a FedEx quest without boring the player.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe elves have a lot of extra reactions if Spartan is in your party (they know him(?)). Again, the dialogue writing is a bit college-y at certain points, but the module has such huge momentum that I didn't really mind. Come to think of Spartan, he didn't fully grasp the idea that people generally keep dogs, not wolves, as pets.<br/>\n<br/>\nNever having played a Fighter/Rogue/WM7 before, I'm very happy with the build. I know it's a classic, and even though I had to sacrifice skills to get bluff/intimidate/persuade (and thus I went with Dex 18 Int 16 Str 12 and three 8's), it still rocks, very dodge-and-weavey playstyle, very strong in melee. It's also going to be my first character with ED (but it will come late in the module). I always thought it's not that much to dodge a single attack against a single opponent per round, and I wonder why it's the holy grail of Dex builds, but I hope my opinion will change when I see it in action.<br/>\n<br/>\nTime to go and save the day. Although a quick glance at Act IV's title tells me that's not going to happen.</div></blockquote>\n\nHey dude!

It's a human to avoid any XP penalty for a non-respawning world and the extra feat and skill points, Con 8 and Int 16 for even more skill points, and I still had to compromise.

I parked the party at the staircase, buffed up via Nellise and then Criosa, and snuck around, disarming traps and knocking wizards over the head. The layout really lends itself for (to?) this, plenty of corners to duck behind. \"Rogues do it from behind\", but really, never fight fair should be every character's motto.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJust after I wrote about the decision below Highmarch, the quest decided to be a bit buggy, and \n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>if you recall, I initially wanted to side with Arminus.

I can only hope that they will alternate in wearing the solar protection ring. \n</details>\n\nTwo more quests that were somewhat bugged: \n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary> Back in Act II, at the beginning, the quest for telling the captain about the ship following the Redoubtable never concluded in the quest log. And in Act III, the evacuation of Bracksford never concluded. Tom Bollard (I believe he's the barkeep?) decided to stay in the barracks for some reason as everyone else marched out of the rax and out of town (they were nowhere to be found on the map between Bracksford and Culdeny), so I have no idea how that quest would have finished. I wouldn't mind an explicit spolier, since I'm quite a bit past that part. \n</details>\n\nI reached Trinity, did everything there was to do there on my first visit (the Tusonite ambassador's wife has MY portrait, oh, the cheek!), and went west first of the two possibilities of where to continute.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That's always completed the quest for me. Equally, I've never had anyone remain behind in the barracks in Bracksworth.

In act 3 I've been using Criosa, RB and Nellise in Stoneguard and used 3 henchmen in act 2 as well. Made for an interesting play through but would have been better with some banter between the henchmen (I imagine this is difficult to set up in the toolset). One difference going into Act 3 is that the character customiser has switched back to vanilla on me which is annoying as I have ocd about characters looking like their portrait. <br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my G3125 using Tapatalk<br/>\n<br/>\n<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Woah\u2026 this module is fantastic. I had very little time to play last week, where I finished Act 3, and two days ago, in a marathon session of 11 AM to 4 AM the next day (oopsie), I went from the beginning of Act 4 through the Hall of Very Long to the Castle of Many Riddles.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot wanting to put basically the entire post inside a spoiler tag, you have been warned that there are ***SPOILERS*** to follow, which, in all honesty, shouldn't be too surprising in such a thread :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rest of the actions leading up to the end of Act 3 were nothing to write home about, the positive energy bit was mostly harmless (everybody had some regen and fear protection throughout the act). In the tower where you fight your first legionnaire, there were two circular rooms shown on the map that I couldn't access, below two other circular rooms and next to the one where you have said fight (and have pretty good Search).<br/>\n<br/>\nI was left with a few open questions upon returning to Trinity. Am I correct that you can't do anything about the Ironlord there? I just had to tank him while killing the rest of his merry little band he appeared alongside. And I assume it's also intended that when you retreat to the North he doesn't follow you. Let me know if there is something I missed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI walked back to Highmarch, and encountered the Rangers in the long snowy map south of it, but that bit never saw any action during the battle - did I screw something up? I took a peak at the place during the battle of Highmarch, and there was nothing.<br/>\nSo I'm a little unsure if I got the full Highmarch battle experience (experience, not XP). When I first had the chance, went out the front gates and held the bridge until most of the Iron Legion was dead, Terry appeared on the parapet and then we could finish them off, including the iLord. Is that how the battle is supposed to look like?<br/>\nA few asides. As epic and fun as these huge fights are, they do reveal some weaknesses in the game engine and interface. The most aggravating of these was how easy it is to accidentally do friendly fire. When you're left-clicking it isn't too much of a problem because hostile entities are prioritised, but when you want to cast or use a targeted combat move (like IKD, which I use all the time) there is no priority. I had to reload a few times because I angered my allies. That brings me to the next point: as awesome as it looks to hire Azurefang for 300K, his hit box is so ridiculously huge that most everything targeted will default to him. It was fun to do in this first playthrough to see how it looks like, but I do not recommend that anyone do this, it's more a liability than an asset because of the messed up targeting. Unless you use pause, which I don't, and probably then it's still a headache.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, on to Act 4, dear developers, please never chain a module switch after a long cutscene. I watched that conversation about 10 times because the game would CTD when trying to unpack Act 4/1. I had to reduce resolution to the minimum and temporarily disable my overrides (by renaming the folder) to get to the new module's beginning. The first part was surprisingly short, but showed me how nice it was that I invested in social skills when I managed to avoid a major battle in the desert. By the way, do you ever finally beat the revenant? I fought it 3-4 times in various places but it always said it would rise again. The usefulness of social skills became even more apparent in Part 2 when I thankfully didn't have to kill an old friend. It seems the check difficulties are sometimes modified based on your prior conversation options. For example, when talking to the barbarian shaman, not mentioning that you have been sent by the chief improves your chances a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs there a bonus for putting out every large fire in the forest areas? I spent quite a bit of time there making sure I got every one (some are way high up in the trees).<br/>\n<br/>\nDear developers, never put a serpentine staircase like the one in front of the Inn outside Stoneguard in a module with a party :)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ranger battle is another one where the weakness of the game engine shows. As far as I can tell, the only aggro control this game knows is proximity aggro, so battles like this become a clusterfakk very quickly, which looks really cool and like the real thing, but can also get annoying. You have to keep the Tusonite commander alive as far as I can tell. I couldn't res him when he died once. I also had to resort to doing the battle alone as especially Maggie would cast creeping doom in the thick of it all, and of course turn all of Tusone hostile :D SoV also has a tendency to hit allies (not your party, though).<br/>\nLack of aggro control was also problematic in the Lowmarch final battle, where I believe you have to keep Cadmus (sp?) alive to finish the quest. You can definitely not resurrect the undead. A pity.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaking wizards wear KD immunity items is annoying, but I understand the reason behind it. Mord's and Bigby IX did the trick on Terry (thanks UMD, give them a taste of their own medicine).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe nicest thing about the battle for the capital was Criosa picking the locks to her own house. After the final fight Ronan told me he'd have something for me outside but he never appeared.<br/>\n<br/>\nI got Epic Dodge right before we went to the Hallway of Very Long, and a few minutes later I could immediately see its usefulness when I had to tank the Emissary of Abaddon or whatever the name of the guy is who comes out of the portal after the Slaad. I should probably not have chosen that doorway as my first, as outside there are quite a few things that don't make sense yet. I do have a little girl following me though, and I got the \u00dcberrapier. Also a shield that gives Raksasha magic immunity, among others, which might be a tad overpowered unless they fight with Max IGMS (or 6 Greater Ruins, like a boss in MTS).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe plot overall has been great so far. It is full of plotholes, but then again so are AAA productions (generally my yardsticks being Dragon Age / Mass Effect). Shame on Bioware, this is how the OC's should have looked like instead of the nonsense they churned out :( (Slapping Bioware with their own stick!) The writing has definitely improved throughout the Acts. I generally like plots that involve a zombie apocalypse like this one, because it's an enemy that cannot be argued with and facilitates the union of different factions. Again DA/ME are good examples of how to use the trope well. I enjoy how the story tries to integrate gameplay elements, raise dead being a prime example, and the attempt is laudable, even though it raises more questions than it answers :)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut enough of idle chatter, SCREENSHOTS!

I'm still running on steam power here (to be fair, I'm running on air atm - still can't get NwN to play - boo), but I'll try to answer what I can from the version I know...<br/>\n<br/>\n(Hope you don't mind, but I've numbered points for ease of reference - 'cos there are a few!)<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Never had a problem accessing any of the areas in the Saqarin base in the desert: and that's without using Search. I can't recall having to retrieve anything specific either (other than the part of the rod, obviously). That said, I don't remember there being a tower in there, so maybe you're talking about somewhere else.)<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Correct, no point in battling the Iron Lord in Trinity at all. I spent my first few return visits there trying to fight him and failing abysmally before Empyre put me straight on that. When you go to the next screen back north, you do get to help the king out against some nasty legionnaires before going back to the screen just south of Highmarch, but you are being followed.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. You didn't screw anything up: it all depends on how you want to play. After meeting the rangers over that stone bridge, I tend to leg it with my henchies back to the north of the screen and park them there, then run back down to the rangers, who are by now engaged in a massive battle with the legionnaires following you to Highmarch, along with those things that just ping down from nowhere (can't remember their names atm) and start killing folk. My thinking is that there's a whole field of the buggers coming up, but they're all bottle-necked, so I get loads of xp, which I might lose if I wait for them to get to Highmarch and others kill them. Plus it makes the Battle of Highmarch that much easier, as I believe there's only a finite number of them, and they don't respawn.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. You do need to leave Highmarch to deal with the mountainous golem who's chucking rocks at the fort, but I then go back inside to await the Ironlord. After beating on him to no avail Terry will appear and do his trick - then I kill the tin bull. And hopefully not everyone else is dead.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Might be an EE glitch - I've never experienced that with IKD.<br/>\n<br/>\n6. I've always killed/had to kill Azurefang outside the Valley of Silence, so wouldn't know. I believe Empyre's Persuasive Archer once brought her along to the battle.<br/>\n<br/>\n7. Again, I suspect it's an EE issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n8. You can get loads of sell-able/usable gear from that battle in the desert! I think 3 or 4 revenant deaths is about right. The last time I see him is just when you reach the screen where you need the water for.<br/>\n<br/>\n9. Alas, I've always had to give battle - and it always hurts me to do so. As to Talon Black Tiger, I know you get better xp from the persuasion route (Empyre's aforementioned build), but you get better gear for a naughty pc/npc if you kill him.<br/>\n<br/>\n10. While I don't think there's an xp bonus for getting every fire, you do get xp for each one - and if you haven't done enough the Treants won't help you, so...<br/>\n<br/>\n11. That must be a new addition.<br/>\n<br/>\n12. All you need do is keep one of the Tuson archers alive - anyone else is a bonus. And how come you've still got Maggie for that encounter? Oh, sorry, more available companions.<br/>\n<br/>\n13. No, you don't need to keep Cadmus alive to complete the quest - just kill the drow priestess and smash the phylactery. In fact (and tell no one, 'cos I try to play good-aligned characters), if you let him die you can loot him for an excellent sword.<br/>\n<br/>\n14. Now that's a shame: the cutscene with Ronan and all your previous pals can bring a tear to the eye. I hope that's just a glitch. That said, did you remember to talk to the cat before leaving the palace?<br/>\n<br/>\n15. That's a perfectly good starting point, but I tend to do it 3rd. I do the frozen realm where you get cut off (Twilight?) first, then Elysium, because there's a bard there who might ask you to fetch her a harp, which is with the chromatic dragon and steal-able (though it might make her cross). As far as the little girl goes...have you found a very injured man, but can't help him because you're ethereal? If so, you might want to seek out a particular pig, then you can show the girl where the man is.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope at least some of this is helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

(And technically, in English English \"a couple\" also means two, whereas \"to couple\" is a different thing entirely...)<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect that harp retrieval is also dependent on the self-same Perform check. I've only had sufficient levels of Bard and Perform twice (active avoidance of the c-word). The theatre quest remains open with only one level of Bard, though a peaceful resolution may only be possible with more.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, that timer can be quite a tight squeeze (I'm on the earlier setting). And for once, it means it. If you're timed out (happened to me more than once), you go to a cutscene of Fairloch which shows everyone dying, and that's the end. So it really is a matter of just getting the job done - you can have a look around afterwards. I think that's a classy touch - it ain't often you're shown what happens when you fail in these games.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know about you, but I found the latter stages of Part 4 somewhat frustrating in terms of story-arc. It all gets a little OTT once the Hall of Worlds opens up. More combat variety, maybe, but a bit...deflating. Still, I can't think of many games where the destination lives up to the journey (so, pretty much true to life, then).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a replay, maybe rather than just soloing, try it with fewer henchies? I think they bring flavour. And yes, Mick's Kama-Shinobi is excellent - the only evil build I've ever successfully played - and in Aielund to boot! Oh, and yes, playing a male character will give a different dimension to Criosa's situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nGlad you had a good time!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

This build would even fit in nicely with my party (though Imoen the Quick might have to get parked - I dual-class her to mage at level 5). Me, Pally Undead Hunter, Minsc (obvs), Ranger lunatic, Kivan, Ranger depressive shootist (not an official kit description as yet), Jaheira, stroppy Druid, and Coran, twinkle-smiled Thief.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Now that we saw some Aielund build requests, for the record, let me post my rogue that I did the module with (you can find my after action reports a few pages back in the thread.) It's a customisation of Maximillian Kane's Drow Fencer that we know and love.<br/>\nThe really cool thing about her is that <strong>she maxes out all three social skills</strong> and still feels very complete, in addition to being amazing in melee and a decent shot. Set trap did have to go out the window, but notice that Disable is still going strong. At the end, with capped Dex, you can take 20-disarm a DC58 trap.<br/>\nLore at the end can be anything, and there are so many skill priorities that you can swap them around quite a bit. The one below worked for me. Keep a CHA + social skills item set for conversations. Your conversation options can very much influence the DC's of the checks, it's done intelligently.<br/>\nI have looked at many builds to take Bluff/Intimidate/Persuade with (and at least 21 Search for a first playthrough) and still not have to compromise too much. Sorcerers (for insane charisma), bards, rogues, wizards, even paladins/bg's for crying out loud, and all kinds of their combinations, but this is the only one where it worked out for me. Watch out for true seeing casters! (Watch out for any caster until your AB kicks in.) You're very tanky even with 8 CON, but you're no Epic Brawler Champion. You're a rogue, do it from behind!<br/>\n<br/>\nDame Roxanne, leader of The White Furs of Bracksworth, founder of The All Blacks, keyboard player and vocalist of Ironlord and his Rock Band (there are screenshots for all of these back in the thread)<br/>\nRogue(17), Fighter(12), Weapon Master(7), Human<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 12<br/>\nDEX: 18 (32)<br/>\nCON: 8<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 16<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Rogue(1): Expertise, Blind Fight<br/>\n02: Fighter(1): Weapon Finesse<br/>\n03: Fighter(2): Weapon Focus: Rapier, Dodge<br/>\n04: Fighter(3): DEX+1, (DEX=19)<br/>\n05: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Rapier<br/>\n06: Fighter(5): Knockdown<br/>\n07: Fighter(6): Mobility<br/>\n08: Rogue(2): DEX+1, {Evasion}, (DEX=20)<br/>\n09: Fighter(7): Spring Attack<br/>\n10: Fighter(8): Whirlwind Attack<br/>\n11: Weapon Master(1): Weapon of Choice: Rapier<br/>\n12: Rogue(3): DEX+1, Improved Knockdown, {Uncanny Dodge I}, (DEX=21)<br/>\n13: Weapon Master(2)<br/>\n14: Weapon Master(3)<br/>\n15: Weapon Master(4): Improved Critical: Rapier<br/>\n16: Weapon Master(5): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br/>\n17: Rogue(4)<br/>\n18: Weapon Master(6): Toughness<br/>\n19: Weapon Master(7)<br/>\n20: Fighter(9): DEX+1, (DEX=23)<br/>\n21: Rogue(5): Great Dexterity I, (DEX=24)<br/>\n22: Rogue(6)<br/>\n23: Rogue(7)<br/>\n24: Rogue(8): DEX+1, Great Dexterity II, (DEX=26)<br/>\n25: Rogue(9)<br/>\n26: Rogue(10): Improved Evasion<br/>\n27: Rogue(11): Great Dexterity III, (DEX=27)<br/>\n28: Rogue(12): DEX+1, (DEX=28)<br/>\n29: Rogue(13): Defensive Roll<br/>\n30: Rogue(14): Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=29)<br/>\n31: Rogue(15)<br/>\n32: Rogue(16): DEX+1, Epic Dodge, (DEX=30)<br/>\n33: Fighter(10): Epic Weapon Focus: Rapier, Epic Weapon Specialization: Rapier<br/>\n34: Rogue(17)<br/>\n35: Fighter(11)<br/>\n36: Fighter(12): DEX+1, Great Dexterity V, Armor Skin, (DEX=32)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 292<br/>\nSkillpoints: 354<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 16/13/31<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Traps: +4<br/>\nBAB: 27<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 42 (melee), 38 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 30/33<br/>\nSpell Casting: <br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBluff 37(36), Disable Trap 29(32), Hide 37(48), Intimidate 37(36), Listen 36(35), Lore 12(15), Move Silently 37(48), Open Lock 1(12), Persuade 37(36), Search 20(23), Tumble 35(46), UMD 36(35)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Bluff(4), Disable Trap(4), Hide(4), Intimidate(4), Listen(4), Move Silently(4), Open Lock(1), Persuade(4), Search(4), Save(15), <br/>\n02: Save(21), <br/>\n03: Save(27), <br/>\n04: Save(33), <br/>\n05: Save(39), <br/>\n06: Save(45), <br/>\n07: Save(51), <br/>\n08: Bluff(7), Disable Trap(7), Hide(7), Intimidate(7), Listen(3), Move Silently(7), Persuade(7), Search(7), Tumble(5), UMD(6), <br/>\n09: Save(6), <br/>\n10: Save(12), <br/>\n11: Listen(3), Save(15), <br/>\n12: Disable Trap(2), Hide(4), Listen(1), Move Silently(4), Search(4), Tumble(5), Save(7), <br/>\n13: Listen(1), Save(12), <br/>\n14: Listen(1), Save(17), <br/>\n15: Listen(1), Save(22), <br/>\n16: Listen(1), Save(27), <br/>\n17: Bluff(5), Hide(5), Intimidate(5), Listen(1), Move Silently(5), Persuade(5), Tumble(5), UMD(5), Save(3), <br/>\n18: Intimidate(1), Listen(1), Save(7), <br/>\n19: Intimidate(1), Listen(1), Save(11), <br/>\n20: Save(17), <br/>\n21: Bluff(4), Hide(4), Intimidate(2), Listen(1), Move Silently(4), Persuade(4), UMD(10), <br/>\n22: Bluff(1), Hide(1), Intimidate(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Persuade(1), Search(1), Tumble(5), <br/>\n23: Bluff(1), Hide(1), Intimidate(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Persuade(1), Search(1), UMD(5), <br/>\n24: Bluff(2), Hide(1), Intimidate(2), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Persuade(2), Search(3), <br/>\n25: Bluff(1), Hide(1), Intimidate(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Persuade(2), Tumble(5), <br/>\n26: Bluff(3), Hide(1), Intimidate(3), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Persuade(3), <br/>\n27: Bluff(2), Hide(1), Intimidate(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Persuade(1), Tumble(5), <br/>\n28: Bluff(1), Hide(1), Intimidate(2), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Persuade(1), UMD(5), <br/>\n29: Bluff(1), Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Intimidate(1), Listen(6), Move Silently(1), Persuade(1), <br/>\n30: Bluff(1), Disable Trap(6), Hide(1), Intimidate(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Persuade(1), <br/>\n31: Bluff(1), Disable Trap(6), Hide(1), Intimidate(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Persuade(1), <br/>\n32: Bluff(1), Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Intimidate(1), Listen(1), Move Silently(1), Persuade(1), Tumble(5), <br/>\n33: Save(6), <br/>\n34: Bluff(2), Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Intimidate(2), Listen(1), Move Silently(2), Persuade(2), UMD(5), <br/>\n35: Lore(6), <br/>\n36: Lore(6)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Long time stalker first time talker..<br/>\n<br/>\nAnywho, I'm in the middle of my first (to be completed) play thru (about to leave for Highmarch in Act 3) using an Exalted Sorcerer. I've played with all the companions I could to experience as much of the dialogue as possible (tho I ditched Spartan fairly quickly because he got in the way of every door, enemy or npc and cuz he's worse than the princess at charging into fights).<br/>\n<br/>\nI really like the module and I'm already thinking about future runs. To that end, I was wondering if I could get several recommendations for toons that facilitate different alignments (not just the goody two shoes), possible solo, and buffing that takes less than 20% of every session. My first thoughts were a monk/shifter or rogue/wm. An all-in-one build would be ok, but a couple of suggestions that fit one or two if those traits would be fine as I expect tho play again multiple times.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf it matters, I'm playing EE on an LG V40 because I can fire it up over lunch. <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I've finished Aielund with an evil character. he did a lot of buffing which I guess is not what you want. Being evil, you miss out on a few perks but it is super enjoyable still, especially if you keep Nelise in your party for some evil - good dialog. She is a total angel for enduring my evil character and his evil ways (I think there are only two actions that she will not tolerate and will leave - I heard whispers Savant created an 'evil cleric' companion to replace her if you choose a certain option in Act 4 part 3 but I never accessed this).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nParts of the end of the last module you will find every enemy has true sight, is knockdown immune and sneak immune (not sure about crit immune too), if that helps with your build design...<br/>\nI can't help much with monk/shifter or rogue/wm builds.

It's perfectly playable as just about any decent build and stands up well to replaying. If I understand right, EE allows you to take up to 3 companions, which one could argue is a good thing, but I like the discipline of keeping it to 2, and all have their merits.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll shut up now, else I'll prattle on forever.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Ninja'd by Empyre!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">NWN:EE has crashed for me a handful of times (Android 9, QCM 845, 6GB RAM) while playing Aielund. A couple weeks ago I spent an hour playing where everybody had literally lost their heads. I think my issues are probably due to switching between apps, prolonged app uptime, etc leading to some corrupted memory. No real complaints otherwise (beyond the ~2mm tall letters). I seem to remember Lilura and Savant talking on some forum* about the module and EE, first guess is at Beamdog's site. Looking through my phone's NWN directory, I counted about 70 crash log files. Apparently the issues are more common than I have noticed. I can't say how much is from playing Aielund however.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI've never played thru Swordflight, so that's on the to-do list. And while I've went OC + HOU, I haven't added on with other modules. Yet. Past me's have played Adam's adventures for NWN2. My phone is full with Beamdog and Square Enix products so I'll have to drop things if I want to add other substantial modules/games. Plus, I don't want to get squirreled when I'm so close to actually completing a significant play through.<br/>\n<br/>\nFeel free to prattle Stag (or anyone else) I'm obviously into the conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe main goal for my next toon will probably be minimal buffing, whichever module I play. I'm undecided on LE/NE/CE/CN. The Kama-Shinobi and Evil Speed Caster look like good LE options. Tho one of Empyre's katana crazos might make a good CE/CN natural disaster.<br/>\n<br/>\n* On that note, are there other forums that go as deep into toon-ology for BG's and IWD? Y'all are almost as sick as those <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.civfanatics.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CivFanatics</a>\u00a0folks.

However, I believe Savant released an Aielund update called \"Enhanced Edition\" mere months - if not only weeks - before Beamdog's EE. This, of course, was not in the least confusing\u00a0<img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" />. The Aielund-specific EE was (and still is, afaik) 1.69-friendly, so can be used in \"normal\" NwN games and shouldn't suffer from Beamdog's \"teething troubles\" (you won't be surprised to learn that we have a thread about EE, too, upon which I also get a bit mouthy). And that's all I know about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I go look at Valerfor's vid, can I also commend to you Empyre's Persuasive Archer (he's posted it here on page 7, I think, so it's not hard to find - what the hell, read it all!) for a different take that seems to have worked well.<br/>\n<br/>\nRight, time for a bit of a BG hit...<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I remember one dying almost under my nose one time while I was busy resurrecting Criosa (again). It's not a bug, it's an event - and I suspect it's a timed one, Aielund does that sometimes, and raises it's worth in my opinion - and you succeed or you don't.

And it helps that the AI means they're not complete idiots when it does come to combat. However, feel free to park them up wherever you feel like - I'm certainly not suggesting you take a sub-par build. Just remember to pick them up again and have a little chat afterwards. Challenging yourself is splendid, but actually having a laugh in the middle of something is priceless.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course, I know you've done it before, Mick, and will do so again. But I can't think you'll ever regret travelling with Maggie in chapter 2, or Bobby Black in chapter 3, even if only for the conversations. You end up actually believing in the world through which you play, not just a personal challenge. Or fun, as it might otherwise be known! <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\nBut if you do want to play a completely nerfed character, how about\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-epic-scholar-bard-1-wizard-39-t2326949.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Scholar</a> ?

I am not foreign to party roleplay on PWs either. The solo play was just something I have done to challenge some builds and how they can be played. I found that the stalker type assassin actually benefits from being played this way, something I also write in my assassin guide. Another point is that many people play on PWs \u00a0with few other players of the same level. So it is good to know how you can manage with a build on its own.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the Scholar build, I did actually try it in a party with miss Nellise and mr Colt. \u00a0I soon gave up. Not because it was hard to make any progress, but because it was a pain to force myself to follow the terrible schedule at every level-up.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I remember that you mentioned in another post that was 18-20 for Aielund and i don't know when that changed.

I never got to make a kukri master coz there were no fancy kukris (except one for evil I think) in game except the ones that i enchant myself.

Otherwise it's like trying to take him down in Trinity - not gonna happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne tip that does work is to run away. And then run away some more. Basically, grab your team (if you're travelling with henchies) and run around a lot once the boss has entered the keep, preferably pulling him after you so he doesn't kill all your allies en route - assuming you're playing a good guy, of course. When Terry pops up, turn around and finish the tin minotaur off.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this both helps and gives you heart that you weren't doing anything wrong!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I can't say I've ever really tried Bluff, so wouldn't like to raise/lower expectations there. From Empyre's recounting of his Persuasive Archer build's adventures in the kingdom (earlier in this thread), it's fair to say that Persuade can completely change the outcome of certain events - without hampering xp gains or loot.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs ever, a lot will depend on how many skill points you have at your disposal after allocating primary ones, which will be determined by the type of build you're playing, but the social skills are definitely worth it if you can afford them. Even Intimidate gets some love if you invest enough in it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust because I'm nosy, what sort of character are you looking to play?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Different classes attract different quests (none plot-critical), as do different henchies - and indeed different genders have an impact. In pure gaming terms, trying different toons helps you with different play-styles, and, of course, going solo will boost your xp (I know Mick's gone to level 38 a couple of times). However, I'm firmly of the view that one plays Aielund for the story and the companionship/ flavour the various henchies lend to the tale - few and far between are other modules that can make me laugh and cry.<br/>\n<br/>\nOthers will doubtless differ, but I'm always in it for the ride, not the end.

I believe I posted a pic which includes her as an Air Elemental further back in this thread (on the Isle of the Dead, as it happens). And a damn fine companion she made! I find it very odd to have her now put into a Cleric role. Maybe someone else knows the rationale (I still don't have EE).<br/>\n<br/>\nBarbarian can work very well, as can Ranger (DEX or STR - but don't forget, if you're using one of the ECB Guild builds, Aielund-specific stuff means you'll get an extra 2 skill points per level, like Bard does, so it might be worth thinking about how best to use them in advance). To my shame, I've yet to play a gnome, but I'm positive it will be interesting!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: The Maggie pic is on page 29, btw<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You can get a surprise extra henchman in Act 4 Part 3 this way, but i won't say any more for spoilers. Moghedien is as advertised, disgustingly powerful. In search of more challenge I'm now switching between my DD for the Dwarf content and Empyre's unarmed strength monk for all the superb monk gear you find. Having discovered the joy of bard I'm also going to have a bash with Empyre's katana weapon master and see how that goes. I wish Maggie Fairweather was a druid in my version but you can't have everything I guess. Might have to use my own druid, World Ender or Oerthblood spring to mind, possibly even a pure build for extra challenge. Feel free to message for any spoilers you might want on the evil path, I won't be doing it again any time soon.\u00a0</div></blockquote>\n\nHow dod you insall the this place holder.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

She has cleric spells and turns undead but I can't equip her with metal armour or druid weapons. I tend to just leave it alone.

In effect, you're right about damage inflicted in Very Difficult mode: your PC will do normal damage, while hostiles do 200% damage to you (so a d6 becomes a d12, etc). This, of course, will give you better xp rewards.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Just be aware that hin (or gnome) fists only do 2d6 damage with fists, not d20 - and that's at Monk level 16, considerably less beforehand. So, you might have to do a whole levelling remix if you're going for a fist focus. Theoretically, you could go for a WF in both and only have a single weapon (there's a size penalty for dual-wielding kamas), thus still giving you a \"spare\" couple of feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: If it's an unarmed-focused Monk dexer you're after, you could have a look at <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/truesilver-s-hand-monk-30-dwd-5-sd-5-t2355093.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Truesilver's Hand</a>.

It's basic crafting from stuff you find in a ruined temple in the desert, and the game will point you at what you need to do.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>You won't have any gold in any case. There's a classic \"have all your gear and money taken from you\"\u00a0 scenario at the start of Act 4.

I'm usually bouncing back and forth between either Baldurs Gate or nwn - and only Aielund and Swordflight really provide that epic story i love from the BG series as well.<br/>\nI am already in the 4th act with Valerfors awesome Moghedien build, but my restartitis is starting to show its ugly head and I am wondering if anyone has had tried a shapeshifting type build in Aielund? I imagine the dragon shape wont really be available untill the very end, but the other shapes may be worth investigating as well. I tried to search the forums and found a lot of shifters, but they seem to all be late bloomers.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks :)<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: welp this may be entirely unnecessary. I have encountered a couple of serious issues that i seem unable to fix in act 4 - part 2. the game simply crashes 80% of the time when i try to load a save (in the tesunite camp). i get messages of module being corrupted amonst others. And even when it somehow works. the transition to the generals tent doesnt seem to work and I am stuck.\u00a0<br/>\nI tried replacing the module with the old 3.08 version in the module folder but it doesnt change anything. I can see from my online search that these are issues people have had on different occasions, but I havent found a solution that works to either the crash or the malfunctioning transition.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Ideally, for a Risen Lord, you want a DD build with either 18 or 22 DD levels &amp; EDR 3 too. Think with 24 DR/- plus 50% immunity to slashing/piercing (plus a greater belt of bludgeoning for covering all three melee types) your opponent will have to inflict 49 Dmg with a normal hit to register... 1 Dmg to you! Of course, you'll be immune to WMs &amp; sneak attackers too. Early Risen Lord shape comes at level 24 If I'm not mistaken (Druid 7/ Shifter 11/ DD 22) with level 27 being more typical. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere's a build from the old ECB Vault =&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build148890.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/bui ... 48890.html</a><br/>\nTerrifying Risen Lord by Skeleton Pope =&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/risen-lord-barbarian-24-shifter10-druid6-for-criti-t2355722.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">risen-lord-barbarian-24-shifter10-druid ... 55722.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, there's Yip, Yip, You're Dead!
