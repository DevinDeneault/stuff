It's good reading too, especially for players like myself who have limited knowledge of some other classes.\u00a0I thought I might as well post it up on the ECB forum as well. I've included all the guides I could find which appear to have been created with a degree of seriousness and effort, along with relevant forum discussions etc... regardless of whether I agree or not with the content (The ECB guides, with the degree of expert peer review involved, are generally excellent)<br/>\n<br/>\nI have used Google Search to find relevant links, and searched the ECB Archives, the ECB Tapatalk Forum, the World of Greyhawk Tapatalk Forum and some of the legacy Bioware forums (smf.asmodei.net/index.php - unfortunately I don't have MS SQL) for material.<br/>\n<br/>\nECB and World of Greyhawk (WoG) content I have listed first. Other content listed after.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAlmost certainly there will be guides and authors that I've missed. If there are any I'm happy to go searching for the guide/post if you can't remember where it is or came from.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe if the list is good enough, I'm happy for the forum moderators to pin it. I also give full permission (and encourage) for the forum moderators to modify my list as they see fit.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"font-size:150%;line-height:normal\">General guides</span></strong><br/>\nMaximillian Kane's A complete guide for building a character (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/general316836.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/bui ... 16836.html</a>, <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/a-complete-guide-to-the-basics-of-character-buildi-t515440.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a-complete-guide-to-the-basics-of-chara ... 15440.html</a>)<br/>\nMithdradates's Building a character: Advice.

I certainly wouldn't be good enough to write one!<br/>\n<br/>\nI kept some of the other guides for comparison reasons - you can see the quality of the ECB guides or guides written by ECB affiliated players is extremely high, and it isn't surprising with the depth of knowledge and experience plus the peer review process and the preparedness to comment if there is something that doesn't look right. Also some of the non ECB lower quality guides are still of some value to players starting out in NWN (with all the NWN EE specials going on), but for advanced players the value is pretty low.<br/>\n<br/>\nI tried to put the better guides first in the list, but for some classes there isn't a lot of good stuff out there.

I remember reading it before I tried out the sorcerer class for the first time. It was written before the expansions when the roof was level 20. The expansions added epic levels, prestige classes, new feats, skills and last, but not least a lot of new spells. The guide contains some perspectives that still hold true, but naturally it is does not cover how you can play and build today after the expansions. The fact that the guide is 17 years old means that the way people play the class also has evolved.<br/>\n<br/>\nCook's document does not cover how to play a sorcerer the first 12 levels as the title suggests.

I would also refer anyone asking me about the class to it!<br/>\n<br/>\nI've edited the post to change Cook's document to 'Playing a Sorcerer'. I read through the first paragraph and glanced through the rest and assumed he only played his character to 12 based on what he wrote (which clearly he had done more than that)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe quality is poor compared to a guide written with ECB standards plus peer-review. He puts some tactics which sound of dubious quality (at least by 2019 standards) in and a list of recommended spells up to level 9 spells without really explaining a lot of detail why he chose those spells. Having little experience playing sorcerer I cannot verify how good such tactics would be. I left it there at the bottom of the list.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI was generous as to what defined a guide. If there was evidence of effort and any useful discussion/learning aimed at improving gameplay I included it, no matter the skill level of the guide creator.\u00a0 The only 'guides' I did not include were the 'alteredgamer.com' class so called guides. I do not believe them to be guides as they basically cut and paste the class descriptions and requirements and have a whole bunch of advertisements to raise advertising revenue. If you google 'harper scout guide nwn 1' for example, you will get these websites come up in the results. They are awful.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Thus far, it seems to me that what we're looking at here in this thread is, in effect, a Guide equivalent of the Build Request/ Unfinalized Builds section - and that's no bad thing. We're looking to be <em><strong>the</strong></em> premium builder site for NwN, are we not? While, yes, we can play nice and light with many things, that building is the core of the Guild, and we want to attract others to us for them to see the value of quality builds and join us - and there are, after all, many variations (if not quite endless, perhaps) yet to be explored.<br/>\n<br/>\nThus, it now seems to me that this particular forum (Game Guides) is invaluable for new builders, at least, and needs some proper care and attention. We'd end up with more informed build requests and better finalized builds (and yes, I include myself in this) with a higher level of guidance from here. Otherwise we run the risk of simply churning out the same stuff again and again to those wishing to increase their knowledge. And all things should be interrogated, and those questions encouraged, obviously, lest arrogance creep in.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, bringing this section of the Guild up to speed will take much time and effort (and I'm really not wishing to demean anything that's here already, it's been brilliant for me, despite apparent evidence to the contrary), and we can't demand that of members.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, how about we do as Tyr Templar did back in the day for the Yardstick Builds thread, and ask for a raising of hands for who might provide what's missing? We're adults (most of the time) and know our own strengths in build terms, so, over to you...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd no, this isn't just a simple way for me to get out of doing anything, before you start!

I'm on vacation and have been working on the data base like it's my job. Mostly by trial and error. A seasoned Web developer would probably be done in a few hours but I'm very much not that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found an OK data structure for the thing, generated some nice looking HTML files with internal linking, the bare minimum but still pretty and very reliable. That thing was NINE GIGABYTES. Just for Nwn1! So simple doesn't work.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat works is having the data indexed and organised in a well thought out way and fetch it with Javascript into one HTML document procedually, basically like a Web app. In this way, the entire dataset for both games is only about 250 mb total - completely manageable.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I've been learning Javascript. Turns out \"fetching\" hundreds of thousands data items directly from the hard disc without running a server with is not something Javascript wants you to do. The alternative is having one huge data structure that gets loaded immediately but then you have a slow sluggish app on startup (I tried.) I think the ideal solution is somewhere in between and I've found a (hacky) workaround to the loading problem that conceptually should work when scaled. Now I just need to reorganise and index the data (for at least the 10th time) to follow the model and code the thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's been a ton of fun and I have learnt so much, so thank you for posting a great dataset with an interesting challenge!<br/>\n<br/>\nSendt fra min WAS-LX1 med Tapatalk<br/>\n<br/>\n<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I wheeled out the Oxford English Dictionary and he had to concede I was correct. The problem was/is that it's a kick against the perceived Americaniz(s)ation of English <em>by</em> the English (the Welsh just sat in a corner giggling and throwing more double ells and dees into everything, while the Scots and Irish had other things to worry about). As a general rule of thumb, I will use a zed if the word is pronounced with an \"eyes\", and an ess if it's pronounced\u00a0 with an \"ice\".

I can't check directly by entering the id's - maybe/maybe not because I'm not logged in, which I can't do since the Register User thing is broken. From a little googling, I can tell you my suspicion: It's the same database and whatever is missing on the online archive is imo missing from the database, unless whatever I'm doing is smarter than Baleos (it's not.)<br/>\n<br/>\nChecking the thing with automated get requests at 1 second each (very optimistic considering probably wont be able to enter id's directly, have to do some weird comparison algorithm with google site search, and there being a max for how many http get requests you can do per hour before the server blocks for a certain amount of time) 9948 / 60 / 60 =\u00a02.763 hours, ~ 2:45 in human. That's under best, improbable circumstances. I don't think it's worth it, and entering that stuff by hand is <em>by god</em>\u00a0not worth it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this source is depleted, detective. @Orion2019<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
