The downside is electrical vulnerability 50%. Also stuff like equipped items do not transfer, unlike druids and shifters (so that knockdown immunity helmet won't transfer, for example).<br/>\n<br/>\nPolymorphed forms cannot use spells or items apart from potions, but can use divine might / divine shield / epic mage armor / epic warding / other epic spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom a Role-playing perspective this build concept would be fantastic, however.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Questions</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nI know only a little about shapechange polymorphs and whether certain forms are better than others.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI keep hearing about this iron golem all the time so its what I have been using.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike is the Red Dragon any good? What about the Death Slaad / Fire Giant / Fey even (?Weapon finesse)?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about weapon foci. I would love this big bad dude to have more AB. Like a Weapon Focus Unarmed Strike / Epic Weapon Focus Unarmed Strike and Epic Prowess for +4 AB.\u00a0 (<strong>Edit: </strong>I have play tested this, and it looks like none of the forms transfer weapon foci as they have creature weapons equipped. The Character Sheet will state the AB is increase, but the attack rolls will tell you a different story. Similar to the druid shifted forms including dragon shape WF/EWF won't work.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat about the polymorph self forms? Things that look obviously useful are the Umber Hulk and Troll forms, maybe the Zombie (although it seems unlikely to hit anything).<br/>\n<br/>\nMords I suspect will also remove the polymorphs as well which would be a weakness.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nOr a plus, cast time stop/mords then bigby's on that annoying spellcaster then shift back with 7+ level 9 spells casts / day<br/>\n<br/>\nSmite Good might be interesting. A paladin version of the build would be interesting as well<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I thought I would throw this out there for your opinion and review.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wish the AB could be higher, playtesting this one in the PGCC module looks like I can get AB around 40+ when shifted but I'll have to look into it a bit more detail.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nMight be a battle of 20s at high levels which might not actually be terrible if he does do 8 APR/round.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll have to look up the math / get back to you on that.<br/>\n<br/>\nI took Monk late for some discipline skill dumps, this guy getting knocked on this backside all the time was a bit a pain\u00a0<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Monk(6), Sorcerer(24), Blackguard(10), Human\n\nSTR: 14\nCON: 10\nINT: 14\n\n01: Monk(1): Toughness, Blind Fight, {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}\n03: Sorcerer(2): Extend Spell\n05: Sorcerer(4)\n07: Sorcerer(6)\n09: Monk(3): Power Attack\n11: Blackguard(1)\n13: Blackguard(3)\n15: Blackguard(5): Divine Might\n17: Blackguard(7)\n19: Blackguard(9)\n21: Sorcerer(7): Great Charisma I, (CHA=22)\n23: Sorcerer(9)\n25: Sorcerer(11)\n27: Sorcerer(13): Great Charisma III, (CHA=25)\n29: Sorcerer(15)\n31: Sorcerer(17)\n33: Sorcerer(19): Great Charisma V, (CHA=29)\n35: Sorcerer(21)\n37: Sorcerer(23): Epic Spell: Epic Warding\n39: Monk(5): Great Charisma VI, (CHA=31)\n\nSkillpoints: 233\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +8, Mind Effects: +2\nAB (max, naked): 28 (melee), 25 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Sorcerer(9)\n\n\n01: Concentration(4), Discipline(4), Listen(4), Save(16),\u00a0\n03: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(18),\u00a0\n05: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(24),\u00a0\n07: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(30),\u00a0\n09: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Listen(1), Save(16),\u00a0\n11: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(11), Save(7),\u00a0\n13: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(10),\u00a0\n15: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(14),\u00a0\n17: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(18),\u00a0\n19: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Taunt(1), Save(22),\u00a0\n21: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(11), Save(17),\u00a0\n23: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(2), Save(21),\u00a0\n25: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(26),\u00a0\n27: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(32),\u00a0\n29: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(38),\u00a0\n31: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(44),\u00a0\n33: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(50),\u00a0\n35: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(56),\u00a0\n37: Concentration(1), Save(64),\u00a0\n39: Concentration(1), Discipline(19), Listen(25), Tumble(30),\u00a0\n</details></div>"

      "content": "<div>Thanks Web for telling us of your experience with the damage shields, much appreciated.<br/>\n<br/>\nI certainly value divine damage as you do as well, and the design of the build is trying to make the golem's attack useful, the damage shields are there as well, and are commonly used by casters, and the BAB doesn't need to be boosted for that, the BAB was boosted to make the golem strong.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI was hoping by boosting up the BAB (from 10 for a standard caster to 16) combined with divine damage (potentially 15-21 divine damage/hit) from divine might and monk UBAB, the golem's attack could have enough AB to be useful, similar to a dragon shape build, except it is now crit immune, with damage shields, with improved invisibility, with spell mantles, with EMA/Epic Warding, eventual 'undispellability' apart from Mords/Breaches and divine damage. During my testing my Golem had around 850hp without max rolls so its certainly up there with DS which is around 900+.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are some base AB calculations for a level 40 iron golem, assuming a BAB of 26, greater bull's strength (2d4+1 - cast first),\u00a0empowered bull's strength ([1d4+1] x 1.5) with blackguard's bull strength feat (1d4+1) and added:<br/>\n<div class=\"codebox\"><p>Code: <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"selectCode(this); return false;\">Select all</a></p><pre><code>BAB 26 + 10 (base str) + 1-4 (greater bulls) + 1-4 (empowered bulls) + 1-2 (blackguard bulls) + 1 (epic prowess) - 1 (large size)\n\n= AB 39 to 42</code></pre></div>\nSo in the end the AB ends up 'ok' ish for mobs but decent bosses the AB is going to struggle. Its clearly support level AB rather than warrior level AB.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe one will be better off by just dropping the AB down and focusing on playing a game of 20s with lots of attacks (BAB of 13 for 7 APR with flurry and extended haste is what I would target) so to speak, and ignoring knockdown for more magical related feats.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI understand Web you have had some success with very powerful defensive builds playing games of 20s.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I find this is an interesting idea and concept, I will work to flesh this out a bit more to see how far it can be optimised.\u00a0</div>"
