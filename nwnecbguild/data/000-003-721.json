its excellent scouting ability.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've invested in lightning reflexes and epic reflexes which combined with +10 to saves against spells should be able to mitigate some damage despite a low dexterity score.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nHP can be buffed up to 725 odd with +12 cons which looks pretty solid to me.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Illusionist(27), Pale Master(10), Rogue(3), Gnome\nSTR: 10\nCON: 18 (22)\nINT: 18 (28)\n\n01: Rogue(1): Toughness\n03: Illusionist(2): Extend Spell\n05: Illusionist(4)\n07: Illusionist(6)\n09: Illusionist(8): Spell Penetration\n11: Illusionist(10): Craft Wand\n13: Illusionist(12)\n15: Illusionist(14): Greater Spell Penetration\n17: Pale Master(2)\n19: Pale Master(4)\n21: Illusionist(15): Epic Damage Reduction I, Great Intelligence I, (INT=21)\n23: Pale Master(6)\n25: Pale Master(8)\n27: Pale Master(10): Epic Damage Reduction III\n29: Illusionist(17)\n31: Illusionist(19)\n33: Illusionist(21): Epic Reflexes\n35: Illusionist(23): Epic Spell: Epic Warding\n37: Illusionist(25)\n39: Rogue(3): Great Intelligence IV, {Uncanny Dodge I}, (INT=28)\n\nSkillpoints: 358\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +10, Mind Effects: +2\nAB (max, naked): 21 (melee), 20 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Wizard(9)\n\n\n01: Craft Trap(4), Craft Weapon(4), Disable Trap(4), Listen(4), Lore(4), Open Lock(4), Search(4), Set Trap(4), Spot(4), UMD(4), Save(8),\u00a0\n03: Concentration(1), Craft Trap(1), Lore(1), Save(8),\u00a0\n05: Concentration(1), Craft Trap(1), Lore(1), Save(14),\u00a0\n07: Concentration(1), Craft Trap(1), Lore(1), Save(20),\u00a0\n09: Concentration(1), Craft Trap(1), Save(29),\u00a0\n11: Concentration(1), Craft Trap(1), Save(39),\u00a0\n13: Concentration(1), Craft Trap(1), Save(49),\u00a0\n15: Concentration(1), Save(61),\u00a0\n17: Concentration(1), Listen(1), Save(57),\u00a0\n19: Concentration(1), Listen(1), Save(67),\u00a0\n21: Concentration(2), Spellcraft(5),\u00a0\n23: Concentration(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(5),\u00a0\n25: Concentration(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(6),\u00a0\n27: Concentration(1), Listen(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(9),\u00a0\n29: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(21),\u00a0\n31: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(33),\u00a0\n33: Concentration(1), Save(49),\u00a0\n35: Concentration(1), Save(65),\u00a0\n37: Concentration(1), Save(82),\u00a0\n39: Disable Trap(19), Listen(12), Open Lock(21), Search(28), Spot(19), UMD(8),\u00a0</details>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Mestil's Crafty Juggernaut</strong><br/>\nThis is the high Con version of the build.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts built more like a tank so I've invested in great fortitude / epic fortitude which again added to +9-10 against spells will mitigate instant death spells/abilities and cleric implosion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough one could swap some of it for lightning reflexes/epic reflexes if death immunity items are available.

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hi Iwan, thanks for posting! And that is not a silly question at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe AC is kept deliberately low in such builds to take advantage of the damage shield spells mages have.<br/>\nThese are spells such as <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Mestil%27s_acid_sheath\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mestil's Acid Sheath</a>.\u00a0<br/>\nWith a caster level of 26 and Mestil's Acid Sheath active, each time the enemies hit you with melee attacks, they will receive\u00a01d6 + 52 / hit.<br/>\nSo if they hit you 4 times / round, that is over 200 damage dealt to them.<br/>\nKeeping the AC low helps the enemy hit you.<br/>\nEven though the enemy hits you more, making the character critical hit immune, sneak attack immune, and with damage reduction from EDR and Epic Warding helps keep the character alive long enough for them to die much faster than you receive damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a great idea GDL has posted. I have simply posted a variant which has evasion to further reduce damage received from things like fireballs / rocks thrown by giants, rogue class to put the skill points in to class skills, rather than cross class them (costing 2 skill points / point), and added a caster level. Overall it might be a nice variation which might be more survivable.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Edit:</strong> Ninja'ed by Zanithar! :)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
