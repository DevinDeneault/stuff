Hence, it's as comprehensive as you are going to get. You can even merge the NWN2 builds using the ancillary project dedicated for that game if you are so disposed.<br/>\n<br/>\n Besides, TK always has several oars in the water at one time with all his NWN connections so who knows when/if a new host is even in the offing.<br/>\n<br/>\n I am still trying to compile a dynamic engine that would combine all that legacy stuff and the builds posted here, but don't hold your breath because I'm attempting it solo.\u00a0 It's on my wish list, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n Hip by any other name is still, unfortunately...
