There's a weapon made specifically for Strength Monk builds. But as far as I can tell, there is NO possible way to make a Strength Monk. I know the quarterstaff is a weak weapon on Arelith, but I'm ignoring that for now. I need someone to not only show me how this works, but also show me a 1-30 formatted build for a quarterstaff Monk. It doesn't have to be.. the -best-, for pvp, I don't think that's possible. But having it be at least passable would be good enough for me. One last thing, though. Please.. don't tell me to go Half-Orc. I'll kill myself if that's what I have to do to make it work.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I am thinking that Dwarf would be a good race for this. I think I remember that a Bard can be lawful on Arelith, so a Monk 15 / Bard 5 / RDD 10 would be awesome not only because of the +8 STR but also because the +4 AC from RDD helps compensate for the loss of DEX AC from making a STR-based Monk, but I also remember that RDD is hard to get. Still, it just might be worth jumping through those hoops to get RDD in this case.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">No, Monk attack progression will be less. You cannot use Flurry of Blows with a Quarterstaff. Doing RDD sounds completely impossible, considering Areliths rules.The Dwarf race doesn't appeal to me at all, but I'm open to accept that if Human isn't possible with the build. I'd honestly rather quit trying the build for Arelith. I don't think it will work out the way I want it if I keep trying.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Mubo, first of all welcome to the guild ;-)<br/>\n<br/>\n Now for your Monk build it would help us a lot if you could post some information regarding the specific rules about quarterstaves and whether you are willing-or-not to multi-class. Race isn't a big thing, Human will work fine as long as the build is good. Are you happy with playing a human or you would like something more exotic like an Elf? I want to tell you beforehand though, that a Monk is best when used as either with his unarmed strikes or with kamas. Everything else will be inherently weaker than those two choices. Also, a Quarterstaff is a large weapon in default Neverwiinter Nights and not a double-sided weapon, that means you will have to use it as a Greatsword but with way lower damage and critical range. So, unless Arelith have changed that, you will be a lot weaker than normal. We can build a STR-based Monk easily though, don't worry about that part.<br/>\n<br/>\n Hmm, here is a suggestion for you. If you would like to use an uncommon weapon that looks like a Quarterstaff but has better stats and allows for improved two-weapon fighting, we can make you a STR-based Monk build with a Dire-Mace instead. How is that sounds to you?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Like I said, the build probably isn't worth trying on Arelith.

Not worth your time mubo, better to role-play at least something that has some potential as well. I can think a couple of build choices for your character but i also liked Empyre's WM choice. Empyre would you be so kind as to make a Weapon Master of Dire Mace while i will proceed with a (Fighter 4/ Monk 20/ CoT 6) build?

The heavy armor gives you 4 more AC than the first build and 5 more AC than the second build, and thanks to UMD, you can still wear Monk boots.

Every 3 Monk levels you gain a 10% movespeed increase if it adds up AND your UNARMED damage goes up, all the way to 16th level, when it maxes out at d20. So yes, there are reasons to absolutely go above 6, many, in fact, it's just a matter of prioritizing.\u00a0You already know what you would\u00a0gain by going more Monk. How about by adding more levels in the other classes, what would you gain with that? Compare and decide! Everything in NWN\u00a0about priorities. Fighter gives more feats, methinks this build has plenty. CoT gives feats, saves and Divine Wrath increases (which after level 22 will max out your saves when buffed with Divine Wrath), so Monk 16 (for maxed Unarmed damage and a much higher movespeed is a good choice, plus you gain all these bonuses! Monk 16 / Fighter 6 /\u00a0CoT 18 is a good spread for an unarmed build with these classes. 12/6/22 is a good spread for a *COUGH* Quarterstaff Monk. :D<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
