I did find one game site (there may be others, my search resulted in 30 pages of hits and I only looked at the first two) which could be what you are referring to.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.advguild.com/AGpage.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.advguild.com/AGpage.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately the game is on hiatus.
