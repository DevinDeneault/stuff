Salvatore's \"The Dark Elf Trilogy\" (with great pleasure), and taking into account that I have played a weapon master years ago, I have decided to create my own Zaknafein.<br/>\nThis weapon master's aim is to be a master with many weapons, one for each damage type.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the build, for your review:<br/>\n<br/>\nFighter(10), Weapon Master(22), Champion of Torm(8),

On first look, just two or three things, if you don't mind...<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, drop Fighter to 8 and raise CoT to 10. CoT can take EWS (though not WS). That will bump your saves by 1 (not that they're rubbish anyway) and you lose nothing. You also gain something else at CoT10, but it's CHA-related so won't really impact here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, take your first WS at Fighter level 4. Hit the weaklings early and hard. You can take both Spring Attack and Whirlwind at level 6.<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, and this is more a personal take - though I understand why you would do it this way, and given the restrictions of WM - I'm not keen on Epic Fort and Epic Toughness at 39 and 40. Maybe another couple of Fighter levels (brought back later) could give you that E/WS in mace you were after?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm going to try this one!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That is not where you belong!\u201d<br/>\n<br/>\nDrizzt still had only a vague idea of what Zak was talking about, but he could tell from the<br/>\nweapon master\u2019s intensity that it must be important. He took a deep breath to steady himself, then<br/>\nsnapped the coins up. He sorted their glow quickly, discerning each individual item. The first two<br/>\nfell easily into his hands, but Drizzt saw that the scattering pattern of the rest would not drop them<br/>\nso readily in line.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrizzt exploded into action, spinning a complete circle, his hands an indecipherable blur of<br/>\nmotion. Then he straightened suddenly and stood before Zak. His hands were in fists at his sides<br/>\nand a grim look lay on his face.<br/>\nZak and Matron Malice exchanged glances, neither quite sure of what had happened.<br/>\nDrizzt held his fists out to Zak and slowly opened them, a confident smile widening across his<br/>\nchildish face. Five coins in each hand.<br/>\n<br/>\nZak blew a silent whistle. It had taken him, the weapon master of the house, a dozen tries to<br/>\ncomplete that maneuver with ten coins. He walked over to Matron Malice.<br/>\n\u201cTwo-hands,\u201d he said a third time. \u201cHe is a fighter, and I am out of coins.\u201d<br/>\n\u201cHow many could he do?\u201d Malice breathed, obviously impressed in spite of herself.<br/>\n\u201cHow many could we stack?\u201d Zaknafein shot back with a triumphant smile.<br/>\nMatron Malice chuckled out loud and shook her head. She had wanted Drizzt to replace<br/>\nNalfein as the house wizard, but her stubborn weapon master had, as always, deflected her course.<br/>\n\u201cVery well, Zaknafein.\u201d she said, admitting her defeat. \u201cThe secondboy is a fighter.\u201d<br/>\nZak nodded and started back to Drizzt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\u201cPerhaps one day soon to be the weapon master of House Do\u2019Urden.\u201d Matron Malice added<br/>\nto Zak\u2019s back. Her sarcasm stopped Zak short, and he eyed her over his shoulder.<br/>\n\u201cWith this one.\u201d Matron Malice continued wryly, wrenching back the upper hand with her<br/>\nusual lack of shame, \u201ccould we expect anything less?\u201d<br/>\nRizzen, the present patron of the family shifted uncomfortably. He knew, and so did everyone<br/>\n\u2015even the slaves of House Do\u2019Urden\u2015that Drizzt was not his child.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

IKD could go for EWF:Scimitar, at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, and this might be missing the spirit of the thing, but with just 2 WoCs - Scimitar and Morning Star (which iirc is both blunt and piercing), you can cover all 3 attack types. This would free up some feats for things like Blind Fighting and Imp Crit - or even some dual-wielding (I know you can't d-w Flail, but I think you can Morning Star).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, again, is there something badly wrong with having 10 levels of CoT? Either with 22 WM and 8 Fighter, or 20 WM and retaining 10 Fighter?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, just a few thoughts...<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

And my build is by no means \"polished\". It only serves to demonstrate that you can build with 3 WoCs. And you are right about Morningstar (my favourite simple weapon that is better than it's martial counterpart, the light flail.) I would not dual wield it though.<br/>\nAs for 10 CoT levels: It might work and give better saves in more than one way. (more CoT and better pre epic class spread saves wise)<br/>\nYou need 6 fighter levels to qualify for WM. You then need at least 2 more fighter levels for the 2 remaining WSs.<br/>\nIf you take F8 CoT2 pre epic you get one more pre epic feat and one less epic feats compared with F9 CoT1.This means that you can move IKD to pre epic.\u00a0<br/>\nThe epic feats will be delayed some but the build should work fine.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: I don't quite understand what you mean by \"scimitars lost in epic levels\" so it is hard for me to comment on that.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Sorry if I was unclear. That formed part of my thinking about maybe dropping WM to 20 and having both Fighter and CoT at 10 (so you'd lose IKD but be able to take both EWF and EWS in Scimitar with that one extra feat).<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

But shouldn't we be having fun with builds as well? As Mick himself says, this is a crazy build, but I bet you could play it if you get your tactics right. I'll certainly be trying either tweaks on Aquarius's or Mick's sometime soon. If nothing else, I'll get to be a better player.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

This is a splendidly different build, which is great! Now I'm going to make things worse...Surely this should be a Ranger/WM? Happy new year! (He's going to call me rude names now, isn't he...)<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond: certainly for me, it's simply a question of priorities. If I've got room after taking \"mandatory\" feats as a meleer - WF/ BF/ KD/ Imp Crit - then \"would like to have\" ones, like IKD/ Dodge/ Expertise - and anything you might need for secondary classes, then things like Iron Will (which I'd personally whack right up there, because I hate failing a Will throw as a meleer) and so on would be the next port of call. There's certainly nothing against them. (They can be annoying though, you have to take them as general feats.)<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
