      "content": "<div>Good afternoon glorious optimizers,<br/>\n<br/>\nI have a build I've been trying to get off the ground. I wanted it all: Sneak attack, 7 attacks per round, all the rogue skills, and crits all over the place. I also wanted it to not care too much about crit immune enemies, able to leverage pure STR to bring them down. This originally started out as a halfling but I wanted to add KD and IKD plus one more skill so human was chosen, however I still have the halfling version around.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis build is heavily inspired from similar works by Mick, Valerfor, and Max though I like to brag that I at least came up with the leveling order before trolling for pointers.<br/>\n<br/>\nBiggest downside: Bad saves. UMD and Clarity will be in use always.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the Kukri Cutter Rogue:<br/>\n<br/>\nFighter(14), Rogue(19), Weapon Master(7), Human<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nSTR: 16 (30)<br/>\nDEX: 15<br/>\nCON: 14<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Rogue(1): Dodge, Expertise<br/>\n02: Fighter(1): Knockdown<br/>\n03: Fighter(2): Weapon Focus: Kukri, Weapon Proficiency Exotic<br/>\n04: Fighter(3): STR+1, (STR=17)<br/>\n05: Fighter(4): Weapon Specialization: Kukri<br/>\n06: Fighter(5): Ambidexterity<br/>\n07: Fighter(6): Two-Weapon Fighting<br/>\n08: Rogue(2): STR+1, {Evasion}, (STR=18)<br/>\n09: Fighter(7): Blind Fight<br/>\n10: Fighter(8): Mobility<br/>\n11: Fighter(9)<br/>\n12: Fighter(10): STR+1, Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack, (STR=19)<br/>\n13: Rogue(3): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br/>\n14: Weapon Master(1): Weapon of Choice: Kukri<br/>\n15: Weapon Master(2): Improved Two-Weapon Fighting<br/>\n16: Weapon Master(3): STR+1, (STR=20)<br/>\n17: Weapon Master(4)<br/>\n18: Weapon Master(5): Improved Critical: Kukri<br/>\n19: Rogue(4)<br/>\n20: Fighter(11): STR+1, (STR=21)<br/>\n21: Fighter(12): Epic Weapon Focus: Kukri, Epic Weapon Specialization: Kukri<br/>\n22: Rogue(5)<br/>\n23: Weapon Master(6)<br/>\n24: Weapon Master(7): STR+1, Armor Skin, (STR=22)<br/>\n25: Rogue(6)<br/>\n26: Rogue(7)<br/>\n27: Rogue(8): Improved Knockdown<br/>\n28: Rogue(9): STR+1, (STR=23)<br/>\n29: Rogue(10): Improved Evasion<br/>\n30: Rogue(11): Great Strength I, (STR=24)<br/>\n31: Fighter(13)<br/>\n32: Rogue(12): STR+1, (STR=25)<br/>\n33: Rogue(13): Great Strength II, Epic Skill Focus: Hide, (STR=26)<br/>\n34: Rogue(14)<br/>\n35: Rogue(15)<br/>\n36: Rogue(16): STR+1, Great Strength III, Epic Skill Focus: Move Silently, (STR=28)<br/>\n37: Rogue(17)<br/>\n38: Rogue(18)<br/>\n39: Fighter(14): Great Strength IV, Epic Prowess, (STR=29)<br/>\n40: Rogue(19): STR+1, Crippling Strike, (STR=30)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nHitpoints: 404<br/>\nSkillpoints: 347<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 21/14/23<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Traps: +4<br/>\nBAB: 29<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 44 (melee), 32 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 22/32<br/>\nSpell Casting: <br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\nDisable Trap 43(45), Discipline 42(52), Hide 43(55), Intimidate 4(3), Move Silently 43(55), Open Lock 1(3), Search 43(45), Spot 43(42), Tumble 42(44), UMD 43(42)<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n01: Disable Trap(4), Hide(4), Intimidate(4), Move Silently(4), Open Lock(1), Search(4), Tumble(4), UMD(4), Save(15), <br/>\n02: Discipline(5), Save(15), <br/>\n03: Discipline(1), Save(19), <br/>\n04: Discipline(1), Save(23), <br/>\n05: Discipline(1), Save(27), <br/>\n06: Discipline(1), Save(31), <br/>\n07: Discipline(1), Save(35), <br/>\n08: Disable Trap(7), Hide(7), Move Silently(7), Search(7), Tumble(5), UMD(7), Save(6), <br/>\n09: Discipline(2), Save(9), <br/>\n10: Discipline(1), Save(13), <br/>\n11: Discipline(1), Save(17), <br/>\n12: Discipline(1), Save(21), <br/>\n13: Disable Trap(5), Hide(5), Move Silently(5), Search(5), Tumble(5), UMD(5), Save(2), <br/>\n14: Discipline(2), Save(5), <br/>\n15: Discipline(1), Save(9), <br/>\n16: Discipline(1), Save(13), <br/>\n17: Discipline(1), Save(17), <br/>\n18: Discipline(1), Save(21), <br/>\n19: Disable Trap(6), Hide(5), Move Silently(5), Search(6), Tumble(5), UMD(5), <br/>\n20: Discipline(2), Save(3), <br/>\n21: Discipline(1), Save(7), <br/>\n22: Disable Trap(3), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(3), Tumble(5), UMD(4), Save(1), <br/>\n23: Discipline(2), Save(4), <br/>\n24: Discipline(1), Save(8), <br/>\n25: Disable Trap(3), Hide(6), Move Silently(6), Search(3), UMD(1), <br/>\n26: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(7), <br/>\n27: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(2), Tumble(5), <br/>\n28: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(2), UMD(5), <br/>\n29: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(7), <br/>\n30: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(3), Save(4), <br/>\n31: Discipline(7), Save(2), <br/>\n32: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Search(2), Tumble(5), <br/>\n33: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(4), UMD(3), <br/>\n34: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(7), <br/>\n35: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(6), Save(1), <br/>\n36: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Save(7), <br/>\n37: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(5), UMD(6), Save(2), <br/>\n38: Disable Trap(1), Hide(1), Move Silently(1), Search(1), Spot(1), Tumble(1), UMD(1), Save(6), <br/>\n39: Discipline(8), Save(3), <br/>\n40: Disable Trap(2), Hide(2), Move Silently(2), Search(2), Spot(2), Tumble(2), UMD(2), <br/>\n\u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>Looks nice! <br/>\nYou only need 40 Tumble. Beyond the 15 required for in-combat movement without getting AoO'd, only the actual ranks matter for AC, not any modifiers.<br/>\nWhat's your idea about armour choice? A STR build calls for the heaviest you can find, the epic sneaking calls for light armour, but then\u2026 oh wait, if you can cap DEX (or at least put 11 points into it for the +8 bonus at 26 DEX) you're as protected with UMD monk robes as with plate armour. Was that your plan? What about while getting there?<br/>\nI would swap Blind Fight and KD. At 1 APR (and in Expertise) you're not going to be using it, while blind fighting might help you.<br/>\nSearch is probably too high. I don't know the exact figures, but unless you're going to PvP or be in a module that has some very fancy custom traps, you need less. Then again, if you're going to PvP, no amount of Search is adequate.<br/>\nSpellcraft would be lovely, even if x-classed, but I don't see what to drop for it (even if you drop Search ranks.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAny caster will need to be taken seriously, you pretty much can't afford a single non-direct damage spell hitting you. A fight featuring more than one caster enemy will need a solid plan pre-engagement. That said, the nemesis of these kinds of builds is the spellcasting dracolich. Since you can't set traps, but do have UMD, it's hide behind the corner and bait as many spells as possible with summons time. Against anything that isn't a high level caster+sneak/crit immune+true seer the build should rock.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Thanks guys, I'll rearrange some things.<br/>\n<br/>\nArmor would be determined by the dexterity items I find. Heaviest I think would be chain shirt and by the end padded armor/robes with enough dex buffs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did use rogue bonus feats for ESF: Hide and MS to offset some ACP, I even planned to take ESF: Spellcraft if I would drop a skill :) but that would mean I could not take rogue levels lower than 19 like Valerfor suggested.<br/>\n<br/>\nDropping down Search, UMD, and 2 ranks from tumble might be worth it for spellcraft. Does anyone know the most search you really need for epic traps? I don't think the PW I play right now (Blackstone Keep) really upped the search DC any further than base.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I honestly have no plan for super casters. I have enough STR to deal consistent damage but I need a way not to get targeted... maybe buddy up with a DD? Where's anti-magic field when you need it???</div>"
