And referencing your recent Santa debate...surely you need look no further? (Though to my mind he would be a judgemental, unforgiving zealot - rather than your easy-going, workaday type of zealot - so paladin/conjuror/purple-people-eater seems closest)<br/>\n<br/>\n One last thing - Empyre, you are an absolute star - thanks for your continuing posts on my original thread, I haven't been able to have a look for some time, but now I can, I have, and it appears you can play a bit.., ;)<br/>\n<br/>\n You may notice that I still babble on, and on, and...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hiya, Mick. I wouldn't let your curiosity get the better of you: I was trying to marry Monk, Bard and RDD, but the alignment change kept taking me roughly from behind whenever I wasn't paying due heed. So I tried furtling around with Monk, Fighter, WM, and that was even worse (particularly as it appears you can't use unarmed strike as your WoC. Arse.) There's something to that maxim about running before you can walk...<br/>\n<br/>\n I blame Empyre (hee-hee). If it wasn't for his awesome Order of the Wyrm (both unarmed and kama versions), I wouldn't have gone near this. Oh, and you too, Monsieur Le Daggeur - for getting me interested in Dex builds! There I was, happy in my knuckle-running, when all of a sudden...<br/>\n<br/>\n I've been a Guild member for a year now, yet it appears I've learned nowt. I am going to give 'evil' a proper go this year (even though randomly slaughtering a bystander seems a tad harsh to stay within alignment), primarily so I can have a real bash at a Shadow-Dancer/Assassin build - which I still think should be by default neutral, but hey-ho.<br/>\n<br/>\n But before I do, I must finish BG2 - I'm off to have stern words with the nasty Drow assassin/mage...<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
