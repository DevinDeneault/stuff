      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hail, Mighty ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\nA long time ago, Valerfor and I worked together on a few of the Baldur's Gate characters. Then, after a while, I continued by myself, because he stopped playing at the time. Out of all the NPCs in this saga, Imoen was probably the one I played the most. She was always in my party in Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, so I got to know her quite well. You could use her as an Archer, but I liked to use her as a flanker. My party was Myself (a mage), Minsc or Keldorn, Anomen, Jaheira, Aerie and Imoen, and I occasionally swapped in Edwin and a few others, like Jan Jansen or Mazzy, or Valygar, depending on where I was in the game. But I never took her out of the party, except for when she was taken by force. She was always my go-to Mage thief. Because she was also a Bhaalspawn (supernatural powers), and because she was dual-class and stopped Thief at 7, that to me in NWN terms means that she was more a Mage than a Thief, but stopping Rogue at 7 in a level 40 NWN adaptation would be sub-optimal. So, I decided to stop Rogue at 16 and make her a DEX-based Spellsword with 23 Wizard levels, full trap skills and HiPS with good Stealth scores to go with the package.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nShe isn't the most overpowered build you could find out there, but she can certainly hold her own in combat and cast like a spellsword, with additional flexibility due to traps, and a great exit strategy to reposition or flee in HiPS. Her AB won't be high enough to hit high ACs, but she also won't be easy to hit, with a high AC, Epic Dodge and 50% concealment bonus from Improved Invisibility. And, as the icing to the cake, she gets Crippling Strike at level 40 just to round up her offensive capabilities.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nLadies and Gentlemen, please welcome Imoen to our

The level 2 Wizard is there just to give her access to Scribe Scroll and make a few True Strike scrolls, since her AB isn't really all that great. She might need them to tip the scales in some battles. Endure Elements, which lasts for 24 hours is also a great scroll to craft, She'll also have a few summoning spells that way to help with the early levels. She's difficult to play, but if you'd like to make it a little easier for her, you could take a few skill points from Open Lock and swap them over for Craft Trap to make it easier to level. Then craft some traps and watch your enemies suicide from a safe distance.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nShe doesn't have a particularly high AB, but it's high enough to allow her to conserve her spells for tough battles in her twilight levels. She has access to a full Wizard spellbook, most of the Rogue's goodies and her sufferable hit points are mitigated a little by having Epic Dodge, Epic Mage Armor and Epic Warding, making her hard to hit, unless she wants to get hit, in which case she can. She can also summon a Dragon, which could be interpreted as her Bhaalspawn powers, to help her in the toughest battles.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what do you guys think?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If you take a look at the skill selection, you'll see that I have LITERALLY 0 extra skill points to get her all the skills she needs to be proficient in. I guess if you factor in the items, you could make her that way, lowering Set Traps and Disable Traps by a little bit, then you could have a few skill-enhancing items that she would equip so that she's still able to recover and set Epic Traps. I personally try to avoid that much swapping if possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, with that split, Epic Dodge would come at level 39, which would make it a little tougher for those last few levels. It is doable, but I honestly don't see that much of a difference in game because by the late 30s everyone you face will have Mord's or Breaches, which will dispel you anyway. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt is certainly doable, I'm just not sure it'd make that much of a difference. But you can tweak her so if you desire!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
