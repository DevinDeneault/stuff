      "content": "<div>No, for two reasons. First is that most magic items won't be usable if you only have three points if use magic device in them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly I believe that since use magic device is not cross-classable, even if you put an item that gives you points in use magic device, it won't give them to you.<br/>\nit's like putting on a ring of animal empathy that gives you +10 to your skill. It's useless unless you're a ranger or druid.<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my Pixel 3 using Tapatalk<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>"

Obviously wizards and sorcerers don't need it, because they can use all magic devices anyway, but they still can't access certain class-specific items without the skill - for which they'd need either one of the aforementioned classes or the class itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

It would appear this particular unblinking eye may have glaucoma.<br/>\n<br/>\nI do, however, seem to recall some mention of the Osgiliath stone, and the Amon Sul (Weathertop) one. And Sauron's own may have been the Minas Morgul (Ithil) one, but might also have been the eighth which was supposedly lost in the fall of Numenor while he was in disguise.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thread hijacked for too long, apologies.</div>",
