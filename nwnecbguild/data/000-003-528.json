That said it is still both dispellable (lesser/ordinary/greater dispel and dispelling effect of a Mord) and can be stripped away by Invisibility Purge with no save, no SR, no nothing.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding GS, you need the concealment effect in place without the invisibility one before going GS; this means you cast II, then attack something (a placeable) to break invisibility but keep concealment and then you GS yourself. Otherwise, if you have the insibility effect in place together with GS, true seers will be able not just to see you (as they should) but also to directly target you. Be careful using GS with Tony K's AI, since enemies will use AoE spells/powers targeting somewhere close to you to circumvent the impossibility to target you directly.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
