To access the Bard Song, you can drop UMD a bit, especially in low and mid magic settings cuz the items won't reach that price range, and then get 9 points to perform. But as this is a rough sketch, I prioritized, getting UMD at max for all environments. If you can let go of ant other skills, Listen can be nice to have and also full Taunt, which was impossible due to the lack of skill points.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what do you guys think? I've spent 10 minutes coughing it up, so there may be a couple of things I overlooked. Let me know what ya think.</div>"

I find myself using a lot of summoning spells in the early levels. I find it easier to level a caster than a meleer for the first few levels, although I will agree that it's quite boring to lvl on summons, you basically just watch them do all the dirty work for ya . Maybe it's a playstyle thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that I see it, I would change up the leveling to get Sorcerer 8 and Still Spell at lvl 9 to be able to have Improved Invisibility ASAP. <br/>\n<br/>\nLets leave that as a very viable tweak for those who are not so OCDed like me about ending on even values. Weird thing is that my Holy Weapon Master with Cheese build ends on Dex and Int 13, but neither is a vital stat for the build, like Charisma is here. You gain +1 lvl 7 and +1 lvl 3 spell per day compared to one with 31 capped CHA, an Extended Bigby 6, for instance  and an extended Death Armor. But a worthy suggestion, certainly worth considering. I must confess I am torn myself. That +1 AB would be nice too. <br/>\n<blockquote><div>Now your build gets BAB +6 and the second attack at lvl 12. BAB +11 and the 3rd attack comes at level18. The strength bonus fom RDD comes at charlvl 10, 13 and 20.<br/>\nSpellsword of Bahamut gets BAB +6 at lvl 8 and BAB +11 at lvl 15. RDD strength comes at lvl 7, 9 and 15.</div></blockquote>\n\nPre-epic leveling may be a little rougher with this toon melee-wise, I agree, but I can level as a caster for a little while at least, then it begins to get a little better when the RDD bonuses start to make a difference, and by that time you will have good buffs at your disposal. Basically you summon stuff for the first 9 levels. At least in WoG, where I play, it's easily doable. Then you get yourself some equipment, unlearn all but the highest level summoning spells you can spare (lvl 4 doesn't count as it's Improved Invisibility) and get some long term buffs to make your melee presence stronger, like Bull's Strength, Cat's Grace, Flame Weapon, GMW and Keen Edge (which you can use extended at lvl 4).<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother tweak I just saw is to take Auto-still 1 at level 30, auto-still 2 at level 33 and then by level 35 you already have autostill 3, delaying that second Great Strength to 36. I knew I had to be overlooking something.<br/>\n<br/>\nSadly, even with my effort to take full advantage of the Bard skillset, there weren't enough skill points to do the trick. I will try to emulate a possibility of a non-40 UMD build, maybe ending up at 30, which would give me 35 modified ranks to free up 13 skill points, which I can use to up Taunt to 39 and Perform to 4. You need 9 Perform to use the Bard Song and with 39 Taunt and Capped Charisma at 32 (+11 modifier), you'd end up with a 50 Taunt DC, which is by no means bad. Won't work against casters, granted, but who Taunts casters anyway?<br/>\n<br/>\nso UMD 30 Taunt 39 and Perform 4 should be enough to slightly improve the build. I am still going to take a couple more \"fresh\" looks into this toon before posting, and also wait on more feedback to be more confident that the end-result is the best possible. I have this feeling that I'm still overlooking a few possible improvements. And I still haven't decided on that Epic Prowess tweak you suggested .<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"
