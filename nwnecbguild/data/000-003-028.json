      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">This is interesting...I remember my first posted build - Grim Stonefoot (Fighter 10/ DwD 23/ WM 7) - taking some flak from Max Kane (I know, I risk waking the slumbering beast) for essentially using WM as cheese, and its lack of synergy with DwD. Now, I recognise that there was a valid point insofar as I wasn't optimizing DwD as far as DR was concerned, but I still contend that WM was a perfectly acceptable 3rd class - I should probably have dropped some Fighter levels, or at least put some boosts into CON. Of course, in a level 60 environment, that can be easily addressed. And that, really, is my gripe with a 60 level build - one can get everything one wants for Christmas, and the art of the builder becomes diminished.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is in no way intended as a slight upon the particular environment or players thereon, merely me banging on about more not necessarily meaning better.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Of course, if we'd all grown up in a level 60 scenario, I'd be singing a different song, and bewailing level 80 builds. As it stands, though, we didn't. So, irrationally, parp.)<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless, I love the concept - nothing stirs the heart more than a vexed Dwarf with access to an axe or hammer! I forget who's tagline it was, but I did like (and I paraphrase): \"Your god was nailed to a cross. My god carries a hammer. Need I say more?\"<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

More traditionally, in a NwN context, it's used when you take 1-3 levels of Monk in a build, just to get Evasion and a bit of speed.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo one's ever explained the expression to me, so I'm just basing this on the context in which I've seen it used before in a desperate attempt to earn kewl points!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
