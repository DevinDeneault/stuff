It's AMAZING not only because it gets the best of two worlds, but also because it does so while remaining exquisitely playable throughout. There is just one thing I don't understand, though: Why Rogue 14? Just for 43 Disable Traps? For all the other totals, you can go Bard 17 Rogue 13 RDD 10 and still max out Tumble, UMD and get the same skill totals you have while gaining a little bit of durations and a few spells per day (1 lvl 3, 1 lvl 5 and 1 lvl 6, plus 1 more known level 6 spell). Is there a particular reason for this?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I'd trade some of the Disable Traps for Open Locks. If you leave DT at 36 (taking the last Rogue at 33), you get 10 points to spend in Open Lock, with the bonuses from Bard Song and Thieves Tools, there will be very few locks that you won't be able to open.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, FANTASTIC BUILD!

Epic traps are no little thing, but of course if disable trap gear is available or epic traps can be bought like nothing then Bard 17 becomes an attractive option (so aye, on WoG you might as well go Bard 17/Rogue 13 for example).<br/>\n<blockquote><div>EDIT: One more thing: I'd take that second Rogue level right away at lvl 2 for Evasion right off the bat.</div></blockquote>\nRogue levels are spaced because of trap skills progression.</div>"

      "content": "<div>*Edit: Ok, question less relevant now that I actually realize what Perform does (NWN wiki not very helpful there, CBC helped me figure this out). Gonna leave my progression here anyways to be critiqued.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, really like this build.  Looks really fun to play with a lot of options for a lot of different situations.  Being able to fit both Dev Crit and ED without gimping the character is pretty sweet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOk, now for my question:  You didn't provide a skill progression, so I had to use my limited experience and intuit what you prioritized as you built this character.  Some were easy, like the trap skills (skill dump into those at every rogue level) and Lore (get that to 8 ASAP for RDD).  Others were a little more challenging, such as Taunt, spellcraft, UMD, etc.  I focused on raising UMD in chunks of 5 (factoring in the CHA bonus) and maxed that as soon as able.  I did the same with Tumble (factoring base rank only).  So I said I had a question, here it is:  Did you hold off on Spellcraft until very late in the build?  Or did you try to get it capped early on?  To do so I would have to put off either taunt or UMD(or both).  Just to give you something to work from, here's the skill progression I came up with.  Please feel free to tear it to shreds.<br/>\n<br/>\n*Edited after realizing <strong>exactly</strong> what Perform does.

There's that Fairy Dragon build mentioned, which is a finesse build if you prefer to go that way, but it doesn't thrill me with such a pedestrian AB and dependency on Bard/Curse Song to hit successfully.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's the whole point of Rogue 14 &amp; RDD... Epic Dodge &amp; DevCrit together in a single package, which would be essentially impossible otherwise.  Though it could certainly play without that pairing, once you drop either ED or DevCrit, you'd need to find another focus and then build to maximize that goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are trying to \"force\" this into a server with a DevCrit ban, I would consider another build, though TBH, there are so many ways to go once there is no longer a necessity of STR 25 in the build (and all the prereq feats).</div>"

It may not seem like much, but the usefulness is amazing because there are LOADS of low-DC reflex saves that you need to make when faced with the appropriate situations, and that just having Evasion will avoid them almost entirely, except for Autofail. The main one is rock-hurling from giants and other monster types. The DC is generally low, so you will make the save for half damage, but that will still eat through your Stoneskin and other limited DR properties without Evasion. With it, you're practically immune to them. Also, Breath Weapons from Dragons and affiliates, some types of traps and a few other monster special abilities, such as the Shield Guardian's Fireball spell. Not to mention spells. I would go as far as to say that Evasion is WAY better than Improved Evasion.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, CT, there are traps with certain DCs that only Rogues can disable, I don't remember the exact number, maybe one of my wingmen can help me out here.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n You'll be pleased to know that this build is saved in my all-time favorites folder, although my version is slightly different (I went Bard 17 / Rogue 13).<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div></div>"

Play carefully - use traps and tricks - hide and sneak until you build a few levels. So much of this game is about learning how to play in different ways - which is brilliant to my mind.

Technically, that's the same AC bonus as a full plate (8 armor 1 dex for the FP, 1 armor 8 dex for the padded armor).<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, It's worth noting that this build will change armor a lot as it flourishes on stats, so you could start off with a chain shirt and kind of work your way up from there as your DEX gets higher.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd just as a final note, this build doesn't necessarily have a monster AC per se.
