Critical (Power attack, Cleave, Great Cleave), 1 more for the Scythe and 2 more for the must-have Bard feats (Curse Song, Still Spell), finally you will need at least Blind Fight, Heavy Armour and Improved Critical, and i am not going to say anything at all for the lack of\u00a0 KD/ IKD/ Expertise e.t.c. That makes 15 feats and you are not going to get anymore than the half of them even if you go Human, so you need to give all of your epic feats as well for those and still leave things out. since we haven't taken any of the epic feats like Epic Weapon Focus, Armour Skin, Epic Prowess, Overwhelming Critical, Terrifying Rage...<br/>\n<br/>\n Lets say we manage to take the most important from these above and leave things out like (Power attack, Cleave, Great Cleave, Overwhelming Critical), we go for a straight killer at least. Since not even in our dreams can afford to get any Great Strength feats, even if you min/max your attributes, your AB is going to be something like 42 max. And even then you are going to forfeit many feats from your list.<br/>\n<br/>\n {STR 16 (<strong>26</strong>)\u00a0 DEX 13\u00a0 CON 08\u00a0 INT 13\u00a0 WIS 08\u00a0 CHA 16}<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">On the other hand, if you want an Intimidating Scyther, the most realistic build would be something like (Barbarian 16/ Bard 2/ WM 22) with Bard being there for full tumble, umd and max spellcraft for saves. That would be a real powerhouse though and could even start as a Half-Orc.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Hmm, maybe Cleric/ Bard/ RDD's can top that with Battletide/ Prayer/ Curse Song by one, oh well...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
