      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">I'm trying to build a zen archer but have come upon a stumbling block.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I buff the archer with Owl's Wisdom, the modifier increases just fine to either +1 or +2 additional, but the attack bonus doesn't change.  Yet if I equip either a +2 or +4 Wis ammy, the AB bumps up as would be expected.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what's the deal here?  Is this yet another burp on the character sheet or does zen archery treat temporary wisdom increases differently than permanent ones?  I know from experience that when I buff with Cat's Grace on a standard dexer archer, the AB changes as it should. Confusing.<br/>\n<br/>\nTemporary inconvenience, permanent improvement (I hope!).<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

So here is another gliche on the character sheet to be aware of.<br/>\n<br/>\nBack to the task at hand.
