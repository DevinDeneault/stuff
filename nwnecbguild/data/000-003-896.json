      "content": "<div>Hi!\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't have specific restrictions besides being on arelith, so max lvl 30, and I'd like to use the path of the true flame (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Sorcerer#Path_of_the_True_Flame\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://wiki.arelith.com/Sorcerer#Path_of_the_True_Flame</a>) and I'm wondering if it's a good idea to multiclass of stay 100% sorcerer.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI want to be useful at a distance, moslty PvE, and good roleplay opportunities.\u00a0 So I'm thinking of going a bit of Arcane Archer, or anything else. But if being pure sorcerer with this path is enough... I'd stay sorcerer!<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm open to other suggestions!</div>"
