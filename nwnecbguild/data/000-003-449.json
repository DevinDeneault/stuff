Also, that PDK fear spell really comes in handy. <br/>\n<br/>\nRace: Half-Orc<br/>\nStarting statuses: STR 19<br/>\n                           DEX 13<br/>\n                           CON 12<br/>\n                           INT 13<br/>\n<br/>\nGeneral pre epic feats:  toughness, dodge, mobility, expertise, spring attack, whirlwind attack, weapon focus *greatsword*, blind fight, improved critical *greatsword*, knockdown, mounted combat.<br/>\n<br/>\nGeneral epic feats:  armor skin, epic toughness III,  epic weapon focus ( greatsword ), great strenght VII,                                                                                <br/>\n<br/>\nSkills: discipline 57, spot 41 ( listen is a better choice ), tumble 66.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun.--------------------<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"/attach/view/ma/845224_27c0d4f304c6a0d279d328f95270b384\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to view the attachment</a></div>"

      "content": "<div>Hey dude.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have already posted a building model on your other thread. I hope you can use it here as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, as to the specifics of this build, Weapon Master 30 gives you absolutely nothing more than WM 28. So, by going Fighter 8 WM 28 PDK 4 you would gain an extra feat at ZERO COST. With that kind of class spread, there isn't much else that you can improve on, but maybe if you share the leveling guide with us, we will be able to provide you with some more insight on feat order, feat selection, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"
