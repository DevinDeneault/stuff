(Seriously, why is there no sarcasm emoji?) I'd be more tempted with Lerk the Bridge Troll and Deekin holding hands - they are at least <em>in</em> Neverwinter Nights.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually, you're not the first to bring this up - Orion raised it a while ago, and I put it in the \"pending\" tray. The problem (if it can be called one) is exactly what sort of banner would we use? It's not like we're specific to one place, like WoG. And, while I spent a bit of time studying heraldry and have a mahussive book on flags, shields and crests and suchlike from the College of Heralds (great, so now everyone knows), I tell you, masons and builders don't exactly have the sexiest designs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sure it <em>can</em> be done (and I'd be looking to our Pathfinders to find out how), but let's open it up, then.\u00a0 Proper suggestions welcome: others had better be damned funny.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That would be in keeping with the WoG site's banner, thus showing the connections between the two, while demonstrating differences as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee, I <em>can</em> do serious.
