      "content": "<div><blockquote><div><strong>Empyre65 wrote:</strong>Here's some ideas you might have already thought of and rejected.\n</div></blockquote>\nThey are all good points, Empyre.  Well worth discussing. \n<blockquote><div>\n * Boost WIS instead of DEX and use Zen Archery.

Getting +3 to +4 modifiers (depending on whether pre-buff level is even or odd number) makes just about all the aspects of the game easier to manage and easier to reach ability caps with mundane equipment.  Secondly, the AA special attacks DC is based on DEX, not WIS.  Those 3 fireballs per day are way more reliable vs. reflex with high DEX.\n<blockquote><div>\n * Replace Bard with Wizard.

The mini song from Bard 3 is okay but not really needed because the AB cap can be reached without it.  But all these servers have different customizations so it is near impossible to design a one-size-fits-all-PWs build.  It is what it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes. I've used Wizard when UMD was not desirable and when most skills didn't matter (usually the case on high-magic servers).  As one of the build's advantages, I just love those monk robes &amp; boots for my archer.  In some occasions, there are sweet ranger bows that can be used.  If the server doesn't offer good class-specific equipment, the value of UMD drops dramatically IMO.  But TBH, there are no low-level Wiz spells that either cleric already has (like Find Traps, for example) or that are useful.  The only ones that would be significant are mantles and breaches but I wouldn't want to commit to more than 5 or 6 wiz levels...  just dilutes the build's strengths too much even with that many levels.  Each 2 less AA levels drops DR piercing level by 1 and cleric is set at least at 15 and preferably higher to access to all spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, with bard I wanted to assure an alertness that utilized max Spot/Listen against those pesky sneakers.  Wizard just doesn't provide that option.  I have already played something similar to this on a server with a re-leveler where I could get it to level cap with wiz and then re-level in bard to take advantage of the better skill set.  Another option I have used is to just ignore Rapid Shot altogether (again, my focus on Called Shot as the staple of the build comes into play here), use half-elf and martial prof instead.  TBH, during the heat of battle I forget to queue RS many times so fight with -1APR (but +2AB!).  Not an excuse, just a fact for me.  When RS is worth the most... in early pre-epic... it sucks down the AB too much (2AB is a lot until BAB of about 6 is reached IMO) to be as effective as just relying on Haste &amp; DP, neither of which costs any AB to boost APR.<br/>\n<br/>\nLong explanation why I feel bard is superior, sry. \n<blockquote><div>\n * If you have the option to play as a female Drow, that would also eliminate the EXP penalty because her favored class would be Cleric.</div></blockquote>\nThat's something I have never experienced... a class that favors cleric. Hmmmm...  Sounds like fun.   I suppose that is a PRC class?</div>"
