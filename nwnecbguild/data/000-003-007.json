Looking through this forum I didn't find any build using it yet, so I have been trying to tackle with one. I have been trying to build a Barbarian 15 / Cleric 15 / Eye of Gruumsh 10 that would use Terrifying Rage and all Cleric buffs. I tried to use Max Kane's Terrifying Priest of Kord (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/terrifying-priest-of-kord-cleric-19-barbarian-16-h-t2354381.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">terrifying-priest-of-kord-cleric-19-bar ... 54381.html</a>) as template, but so far I'm stuck. Does anyone have suggestions as to how best order each class to get to the result? Or is it unfeasible? Another idea was to go Bard instead of Cleric for UMD and Song Buffs, but I'm quite partial to the Cleric version. Thanks in advance for all your feedback.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
