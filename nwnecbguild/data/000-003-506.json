Arelith opened a server where everyone begins at level 9, and is capped at level 9. Low magic, and you need at least 3 levels (straight) for any multiclass. Now... does anyone have any idea about something useful to do with just 9 levels? I know I want a melee character, but beyond, with just 9 levels, I can't think of much. Maybe Cleric.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I my have to go look at this server one of these nights.<br/>\n<br/>\nConlaoch<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Unless they would do some sort of kill count vs. CR or something, but that would really become a chaotic way to gather data and totally subjective. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt MUST be PvP, in which case a cheesy high-CON pure wiz/sorc with the 3 damage shields and True Strikes should do the trick.  Maybe throw in an enhanced dire bear while shooting with an xbow.  DevCrit will never become an issue, just KD... for a few rounds   Which is why I would rather have eternal root canal done than engage in PvP.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Lvl 9 is kinda meh, but whatever. A lvl 9 cleric with the healing domain will have access to heal and trickery or magic domain will grant some nice extras. Scribe scroll/Craft wand would be excellent choices for extra spells and Zen Archery would take care of AB possibly together with PBS and RS. Melee is viable too, after all we are dealing with a cleric here, ah!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
