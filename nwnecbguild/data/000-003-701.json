      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"><strong>Boccob's Tricky Devastator</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a pretty simple build concept:<br/>\n<br/>\nHigh caster level cleric for buffs / durations / some mord resistance (not perfect)<br/>\nBase Str 32, 40 Base AB with BAB 25 / Dev crit (asap) for combat power.<br/>\nRogue for evasion, light skill dumping into tumble, UMD, detection skills and disable trap.<br/>\nHuman for the skill points and bonus feats, it is quite skill point and feat starved.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI chose Trickery for invisibility, improved invisibility and Divine Trickery.<br/>\nI chose Knowledge for Clairaudience/clairvoyance (level 3) and True Seeing (level 4) to boost detection skills.<br/>\n<br/>\nUMD can add haste/mass haste/stoneskin etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't particularly use cleric 7-9 spells for some reason, so the fact they arrive late doesn't actually bother my playstyle that much. I know Mick has advised me about this in the past. If you want them earlier then feel free to drop Str down in exchange for Wis. To be honest I think I just like the lower level buffs much better. It's a no DC caster anyway. Greater Sanc and Heal are obtained with cleric 6 so I don't personally see this as a huge loss.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nLooks good to me both solo and in parties. With 32 strength you could swap Scimitar for Greatsword, but the shield being equipped and being buffable adds a lot of defensive power, and you being alive to heal/buff and resurrect teammates is valuable.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Cleric(32), Fighter(6), Rogue(2), Human\nSTR: 16 (32)\nCON: 12\nINT: 14\n\n01: Fighter(1): Blind Fight, Power Attack, Cleave\n03: Cleric(2): Weapon Focus: Scimitar\n05: Cleric(4)\n07: Cleric(6)\n09: Cleric(8): Extend Spell\n11: Cleric(10)\n13: Cleric(12)\n15: Cleric(14): Improved Critical: Scimitar\n17: Cleric(16)\n19: Cleric(18)\n21: Cleric(20): Great Strength I, (STR=22)\n23: Cleric(21)\n25: Cleric(23): Great Wisdom I, (WIS=17)\n27: Cleric(25): Great Strength III, (STR=25)\n29: Cleric(27)\n31: Cleric(28)\n33: Cleric(30): Great Strength IV, (STR=28)\n35: Cleric(32): Armor Skin\n37: Rogue(2): {Evasion}\n39: Fighter(5): Great Strength VI, (STR=31)\n\nSkillpoints: 227\nSaving Throw bonuses:\u00a0\nAB (max, naked): 40 (melee), 25 (ranged)\nSpell Casting: Cleric(9)\n\n\n01: Concentration(4), Discipline(4), Save(12),\u00a0\n03: Concentration(1), Save(20),\u00a0\n05: Concentration(1), Save(28),\u00a0\n07: Concentration(1), Save(36),\u00a0\n09: Concentration(1), Save(44),\u00a0\n11: Concentration(1), Save(52),\u00a0\n13: Concentration(1), Save(60),\u00a0\n15: Concentration(1), Save(68),\u00a0\n17: Concentration(1), Save(76),\u00a0\n19: Concentration(1), Save(84),\u00a0\n21: Concentration(1), Save(92),\u00a0\n23: Concentration(2), Save(29),\u00a0\n25: Concentration(1), Save(37),\u00a0\n27: Concentration(1), Save(45),\u00a0\n29: Concentration(1), Save(53),\u00a0\n31: Concentration(1), Save(32),\u00a0\n33: Concentration(1), Save(40),\u00a0\n35: Concentration(1), Save(48),\u00a0\n37: Disable Trap(7), Listen(30), Search(3), Tumble(15), UMD(9),\u00a0\n39: Concentration(1), Discipline(4),\u00a0</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

A nice way to keep yourself, your group and your summon\u2019s alive a little longer, give you some armor flexibility and to offer a small buff to those roguish skills where needed.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIt will give you some motivation to cast higher level spells as well :). You can fill up level 8 and 9 slots with AoV and Extended AoV!  And battle mastery is a nice \u201coh crap\u201d emergency button.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid I mention I love cleric builds?<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

A throwing axe or dart from this fellow is going to do quite a bit of damage, given the mighty bonus is uncapped on such items.\u00a0<br/>\nOverall I think its definitely stronger than Knowledge domain if there are Watchman's Helms or Gem's of True Seeing available in your environment to get to level 22 for the Rogue skill dump.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
