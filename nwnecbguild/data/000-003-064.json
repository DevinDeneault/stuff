      "content": "<div>Hi there guys, here's my next insane idea :)<br/>\n<br/>\n The whole thing started when I played a bit with Hip's Fantabulous Contrapulator and searched for builds with equally good melee and ranged AB. There are many good builds like this, but all of them are DEX based. The best one with STR focus stops at 42/37 melee/ranged (the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2353227/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dodji Domotai</a> by Valerfor) and that 37 ranged AB is just a sidekick of the high DEX, but the build seems to be melee focused to me. TBH even amongst the DEX builds the only one I found with intended focus in both melee and ranged is the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2354617/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Wulgar Ironbow</a> by HipRedux with 46 AB in both attack types.<br/>\n<strong>EDIT:</strong> I just found a very similair build by Mick, the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2349714/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dual Purpose Warrior</a>, but it stops at lvl 20. I haven't found it earlier, because I didn't make searches for AA builds with STR focus, I only checked the ab. Well, one more reason to make a lvl40 version of it:)<br/>\n<br/>\n So, how should it look like? I see only two possibilities here:<br/>\n \u00a0- the first one is some kind of druid or druid/shifter where we use high WIS and zen archery for ranged attacks and shapeshifting for melee attacks (like dragon form), but I'm not really interested in this right now<br/>\n \u00a0- the other one utilizes AA levels to supplement ranged ab with an average DEX score, while we pump STR for melee, and this is what I want to do<br/>\n<em>- (a third one could be an RDD build, but on first look the STR and DEX would end up around 26, I think the ab would not be enough here)</em><br/>\n<br/>\n What classes would I choose?<br/>\n \u00a0- AA, this is obvious<br/>\n \u00a0- for AA prereq I would go with bard, mainly because of UMD and tumble as class skills. The wiz and sorc would give me a slightly better spellcasting, but I dont really want to cast spells<br/>\n \u00a0- for third class I choose fighter, because the build is feat starving, and I think I would loose too much ab if I go CoT<br/>\n<br/>\n Race:<br/>\n \u00a0- my choice is the half-elf to avoid the XP penalty<br/>\n<br/>\n Weapons of choice:<br/>\n \u00a0- on the ranged side, bows are must (and probably longbow is a better choice)<br/>\n \u00a0- on the melee side, currently I'm hesitating between sword-and-board and a good two-hander... the build has the chance to take devcrit and go with a scimitar, but also it can go for pure damage and take a greatsword/halberd/etc<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, lets see the build:<br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\n<br/>\n Fighter(14), Bard(3), Arcane Archer(11), Half-Elf<br/>\n Alignment: any non-lawful<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 17 (26)<br/>\n DEX: 14<br/>\n CON: 13<br/>\n WIS: 8<br/>\n INT: 14<br/>\n CHA: 8<br/>\n<em>There are many possibilities here...

      "content": "<div>Hi hunearo :)<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, I haven't crunched any numbers yet, but I wondered whether there was another alternative to the first concept you mention (the druid one) - and that's monk. My first thought would be something on the lines of Monk 20/ CoT 14/ Fighter 6, STR/WIS-based, focusing in Unarmed and zen-based Longbow, and because monk AC benefits from WIS you can wear a frock throughout. Perhaps a pre-epic split of Monk 12/ Fighter 6/ CoT 2. If you go human that means you can get 2 sets of WF and WS, 2 Imp Crits, Blind Fight, PB Shot, Rapid Shot, Zen Archery and Called Shot and still have one feat spare (you'll be getting the knockdown twins, Cleave and the evasions for free).<br/>\n<br/>\n As I say, just a thought. Any merit?</div>",

      "content": "<div>Interesting idea... let's just do a quick calculation:<br/>\n \u00a0- start with 16/16 str/wis (and maybe 14int / 12 con)<br/>\n \u00a0- with epic general feats you could get +7 str/wis at most<br/>\n \u00a0- with epic cot feats a maximum of +5 wis is reachable<br/>\n \u00a0- and the +10 on lvlups<br/>\n This is +22, so 27/27 is reachable. 26/26 is the same, and there is room for two EWFs. 24/24 has the same ab if you take epic prowess, and this means three more epic feats (maybe 2 EWS and armor skin).<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, lets see the AB:<br/>\n \u00a0- BAB would be 27<br/>\n \u00a0- 24 STR/WIS means +7 modifier<br/>\n \u00a0- WF, EWF and EP is +4 together<br/>\n On lvl40 you would end up with 38/38 melee/ranged ab.<br/>\n<br/>\n And sadly AFAIK wf in unarmed doesn't qualify for CoT, so you have to take a third focus. (Or did you take this into account? Because with a third focus you still have one feat spare - 4 bonus from fighter, 1 from cot, 1 from human and 7 general feats)</div>"

      "content": "<div>I could pretend and say \"yes, the spare feat was meant for a 3rd focus in order to get CoT\", but that would be a big smelly lie, I had actually forgotten. However, no harm no foul, eh? Kama might be a good bet, because then you'd have blunt, piercing and slashing potential. The other feat might be useful for Toughness maybe, making up for a low-ish CON.<br/>\n<br/>\n My thought was also an initial 16/16 STR/WIS split ending at 24/24, with 2 EWFs and EWSs, Epic Prowess and Armor Skin in epic levels (in other words using 6 of the 7 general feats for stat boosts, leaving the CoT bonuses at 4, 6, 8, 10 and 14 and the remaining general feat to take the aforementioned feats). Although (and this has just come to me as I type) theorectically epic CoT bonuses could also be used for Great Wisdom, so there might be a case for that, as it would free up other stat increases for strength - more sums, I'm afraid.<br/>\n<br/>\n Your saves would all be considerably better, as indeed would your AC, and your fist would be hitting with a d20 worth of damage.<br/>\n<br/>\n An AB of 38 might be more problematic - I always try to crack 40, but if it's specifically for SoU/HotU you should be alright. I know we shouldn't design for gear, but we'd be daft not to take it into account to some extent.<br/>\n<br/>\n Worth pursuing?<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Sorry, hunearo, you ninja'd me!</div>",

The same goes for RDD, you can't do it with more than 17 pre-epic BAB and you must start with bard. Also the RDD version seems to be very short on feats at first glance if I want an extra focus on a melee weapon. The plus side is that you can use elf withot penalty with two prestige classes, more base skillpoints, and probably even the RDD version could get better saves.<br/>\n (Btw I made some glass-cannon Bard/RDD/AA builds earlier, but now the fighter version seems better to me if I only focus on a bow and I go for high devcrit DC and high AB.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>EDIT:</strong> of course now I'm talking about lvl40 power building, not the SoU/HotU version.</div></div>"

Well, I can take points from spellcraft, and put those on UMD at level 38, but I think if I want to pump UMD over 25 probably it would be better to take two more bard levels (for more dump levels) and drop two fighters (and armor skin).<br/>\n \u00a0- about epic prowess and armor skin... many earlier versions didn't even have the room for armor skin. Only in this final version was I able to squeeze in both, and somehow I tought epic prowess is more important. However if I have problems with monsters hitting me constantly at lvl28 I will take armor skin there instead of epic prowess :)</div></div>"
