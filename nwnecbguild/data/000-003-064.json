      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hello!<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm quite frankly not very good at making builds so I'd like to request one. This is a necromancer that will be used on the Arelith server which has its level capped at 30. It's going to be more PVM focused as it's heavy summons and I figured that would be where it would shine better. I'm really not very picky about what race is used as I enjoy playing anything and can adapt to it in time. Having Pale Master incorporated in it will probably not happen as I don't have the requirements for it. Thanks in advance to anyone willing to help.<br/>\n<br/>\n Additional Info:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Summoning_Changes\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://wiki.arelith.com/Summoning_Changes</a><br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Spell_changes\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://wiki.arelith.com/Spell_changes</a><br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Category:Race\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://wiki.arelith.com/Category:Race</a><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

However, until someone who knows what they're on about comes along, might I direct you to a thread on page 2 of this sub-forum, with the title *Cue Star Wars Opening Music*. Essentially, it's also about constructing a necromancer for Arelith, so it might well be of interest.<br/>\n<br/>\n Sorry I can't be more useful, but someone who can will be along erelong.<br/>\n<br/>\n Good to have you on board! <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"/emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It's on the first page of the Mid Epic - Level 30 Builds sub-forum. It might be just what you're looking for - and it's a gnome too, which is cool!<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
