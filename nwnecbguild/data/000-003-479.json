Also there is a option to drop AS for EP to gain another AB.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat i like about my last build is it's immunities, high AC and decent fort/will saves. What i don't like is the lack of feats and the 4th attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nPs. i see some feats could be placed better but this post is about the concept, not about the feats on each

Or rather: how does it compare in power with build #1? Though dual wielding handaxes can be fun i guess.<br/>\n-Your right on the halfling, just wanted to try it out.<br/>\n-I changed build #3 to scythe's after some hints a few posts up.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Your dual-wielder will actually have an AB of 38 when you have both handaxes out since it is -2/-2 penalty with 2 small weapons and the necessary feats.  Your primary attack schedule is going to be +38/+33/+28/+23.  Unless you're fighting low AC mobs, that 4th attack will often times need a 20 to hit.  Clerics aside, if you can grab the 4th attack on a toon (pre-epic bab of 16), it's pretty silly not to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn't worry about it on your Bard/RDD/PM.  Again, that 4th attack (if you had one) would have been at +25 so there is a good chance it will also miss.  <br/>\n<br/>\nStrength is a modifier for Discipline but it is no substitute for it.  I would drop points off of Spellcraft and some from UMD to bump Discipline.  It also helps if your weapon is at least the same size as the mobs.</div>"

Also I get some Bard spell casting &amp; Curse Song. Oh and of course Power Attack &amp; Cleave.<br/>\n<br/>\nI lose a fair amount of DPS due to using a simple 1 hander, two Epic Spell summons which are pretty weak and just take exp and Knockdowns which can be great, but are activated.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost of the time you just leave the char alone and he will mow everything down. Epic Warding &amp; Bard Song for tougher fights.<br/>\n<br/>\nPossible feat variations: move Power Attack up instead of Luck of Heroes and swap Curse Song for WF: Spear and lvl 15 feat for Improved Critical: Spear if you want to have a 2 hander option.</div>"
