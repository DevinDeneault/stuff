      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">32 SR is not going to be effective at all at endgame if that's what you're planning for and thus not worth the ECL that will make leveling take mind numbingly longer.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso there really isn't much to a build if you just want big sneak attacks with nothing else, pump up dex, take epic sneak attack, and take some fighter or bard levels at epic to dump discipline/grab an epic skill focus in it.  Bow sneak attacks are somewhat unreliable and the bow suffers a penalty to hit knockdown'd targets making it not really the weapon of choice for sneaks.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
