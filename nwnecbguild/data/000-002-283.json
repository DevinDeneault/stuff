      "content": "<div>I was looking at throwing weapons and discovered, that out of all the weapons Shuriken's are by far the worst, for 1), they are not Instantly Mightyed, for 2) they have less damage 1d3 when all the others except throwing axe is 1d6. Apart from that the only difference is they don't weight anything. and they are piercing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso you need (unless you are monk) Exotic Weapon proficiency, to me this seems very, very poor for a weapon choice when darts weigh 0.1 do more damage and are simple weapons, meaning ANYONE can sue them pretty much.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnless they are thrown faster somehow, such as by Monk whit kama.(Do monks use them like they do Kama and US?)If not then they seem absolutely pointless.<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I missing something or are Shuriken's really the most pointless weapon in the game?<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Shuriken\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://nwn.wikia.com/wiki/Shuriken</a><br/>\n<br/>\nTIA</div>"

      "content": "<div>TO quote Ross from Friends \"Do you realize, we almost went 10 years without bringing that up.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, you are correct.  Who on earth would even research shurikens?  LOL  I guess on some server, somewhere, you can craft some mean MEAN shuris, but I doubt it.  They were added, i believe, simply to give people who dont care about power a \"look\"!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to see a \"useless\" weapon, look at a WHIP!  d2 (yes that is right, DTWO as in 1 or 2), can only use 1 at a time.  Truly a pathetic piece of weaponry.  That said, <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build206145.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 06145.html</a>  I built one that should be ok.  I tired to get more damage out of her (yes HER), by using wpn master, but after the comments, i would replace that class with ROGUE (for more sneak).  note: i built HER the way i did because someone aske a question, and I wanted to get into the dwarf assassin's guild.  Oh, i miss those days  *tear</div>"

Your memory is longer than mine (and more accurate!).  I just cant imagine why ANYONE would ever do a d2 weapon!  Unless it has tons of junk on it...  I originally wanted to do a dual whip concept, but alas, nwn seems to think a whip is too difficult to use with either hand, despite that i have seen it done many many times.  Oh well.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Kharlindale Realms has actually done some enhancements and given some love to Shurikens and Shadowdancers.  They have a crafting system (available for all weapons, armors and shields) but a specific one for Shurikens.  They have tied this to Shadowdancer levels so there is an incentive for people to build more than the customary 1-5 levels of SD.  For most players, they will already have pretty staunch equipment when they can actually make these more powerful shurikens, so it is still not on par, but it does give it a nice flavor change.</div>"

Thus the kobold commando could get a usable disarm(whip) feat from merging basic whip properties.  It comes down to what is more valuable to a shifter the improved disarm feat or the exotic weapon proficiency feat, and if improved disarm is less worthwhile than exotic, then whips can supply the simple disarm feat part.</div>"

However, per your observation, the epic minotaur would benefit greatly by merging a whip.   Other than exploiting the equipment merge though, whip is near the bottom of my weapon preferences list, right there with shurikens.</div>"
