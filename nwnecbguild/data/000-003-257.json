      "content": "<div>I got this idea for a Bard/Dragon Disiple/ ?I put a ? because I couldn't think of anything else...I wasn't entirely sure if I should make it somewhat melee oriented. But, because Bard/RDD need CHA to be somewhat helpful. I'm uncertain of a build to play around with and was hoping you guys were capable of helping, me. I've never really built anything except a 14 Paladin/14 Cleric/ 12 Blackguard (R.I,P nurses needed to get an evil alignment.) And that didn't really turn into my favor. But, enough rambling on from me. I came to ask a request since my character building skills are somewhat...subpar currently.\u00a0 The server I'm currently on is named Amia and it has a lv 30 cap. Whilst they have subraces which can make base stats very. I intend to stick with the orginal Human, elf, etc. (Ah, more rambles). I came to ask for your help in building a Bard/RDD/ ? melee (if not spellcaster :3) build. If possible I'd like you to help me create somewhat that can do PvM somewhat decent, whilst not ignoring PvP prowess (Drows and their sacrifices xD)).<br/>\n<br/>\n If possible I would like it to be of the Elf race. I'm normally more of a spellslinger but I don't entirely see that possible without a sorcerer, or wizard, and since focusing in two INT, CHA seems like a bad option. So, I was thinking of trying out melee for once.<br/>\n<br/>\n To be honest, I'm such a spellslinger (even though I don't know much about it either) I have no idea about melee feats, and all. So, that would be a big help. (Though, now that I just thought of it Paladins use CHA.. so, it could be a Pal/Bard/RDD.)) But, I'm really in need of help. I don't even know where to begin haha ^^.<br/>\n<br/>\n The server has these modifications (I don't know how to put a spoiler tag or something. So, I'll just put quick likes for the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.amiaworld.net/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;p=934722#p934722\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Feats, Class Changes</a>, and <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://amiaworld.net/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=56068\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Spell Changes</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\n I appreciate any help in advance, and any questions you have feel free to ask ^^.

      "content": "<div>Hi Rua, good to see a fresh face (means I'm no longer the new kid - in membership if not ability!). Hope you are well.<br/>\n<br/>\n As the others could no doubt tell you, I haven't done a build myself (yet), and am something of a newcomer to NwN. However, if you're thinking about a melee-centric Bard/RDD, I'm currently running through the Original Campaign/Aribeth Redemption/The Gods Themselves with an Elven Dragon Dual-Wielder (Fighter 16/Bard 14/RDD 10), as is Valerfor (who I'm sure will introduce himself later, and who has got further along than me). I'm the other way round from you, in that I only really play melee - magic spooks me - and this is definitely worth a look.<br/>\n<br/>\n If you're interested, you can find the details in the Non-magicky, non-shooty Elves thread in this section of the Guild. It was constructed for me by Empyre65 (again, you'll encounter him ere long, I'm sure) with input from Valerfor after level 20 (entries 7 and 9 in the thread). It is a full 1-40 level build, but is currently kicking some serious ass for me at level 22. I leave it with you for your consideration. I certainly think it's an excellent build. If it doesn't take your fancy, I'm sure the various clever souls here will be of help.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers!</div>",

      "content": "<div>Heya and welcome to the ECB Rua!<br/>\n<br/>\n a) If what you wanted is a spellcaster build (as in your initial request - i gather) then you could do better than mix Pale master after 20 solid levels of Wizard. You would be too close to be undispellable and get epic bonus feats to do that now. If you want a Wizard/ Palemaster you need 40 levels to do it properly. Of course if that is what you need (for Rp purposes-OR not), then we could do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n b) If what you want is an RDD, then the classic and very strong combo (Ftr/ Bard/ RDD) will do that and more. One of the strongest builds available on any level of play.<br/>\n<br/>\n c) Have you seen the other lvl 30 builds that are in that section of the forums?

You could go Bard-heavy for more buffs and a better song, or Fighter-heavy for more feats and a higher BAB. With either Fighter or Cleric, you could go sword-and-board to get the AC from a shield, or go two-handed to deal more damage (and receive more damage, too, because of the loss of shield AC).</div>",

      "content": "<div>Yeah, Cleric inside - like we say \"Pentium Inside\", is probably one of the most powerful option but with only 30 levels to work, your build will be susceptible to dispels, and i am not talking about Mord's here. Then your all powerful \"Pentium\" will become a decrepit \"Celeron\" and will run for cover instead. These solutions work much better for modules were there is no real A.I to take care of your uber-buffs (unless you install Tony's 1.08 Henchman and Battle Mod), for PW's the 16th level Bard song/ Curse Song it's more preferable.<br/>\n<br/>\n I am not saying it won't work, and it will be most powerful if not get dispelled, but it won't be like Mith's \"Blood and Faith\" which <strong>is </strong>Undispellable and even better the later improvements that made his build a (Cleric 28/ Bard 2/ RDD 10) for added Mord's resistance. Still a good idea Empyre.</div>"

As I initially made a build myself wasn't to grand, for...higher stuff anyway xD. My mind keeps switching to a lot of things, like Pale-master, Bard, druid, and so on. But, even when I try out these (Either, as full bard, etc or multi-class) I can't seem to bring about the potential I can see. I'm not saying I can't really think of what I want (though a pale-master would be nice. It wouldn't fit to the alignment of my character.) I was wondering if you could help me make a bard, maybe minus RDD. That is good for buffing, but not completely sit back if needing to hop in and fight.</div>"

IMO roleplaying bards is not restricted to musicians and entertainers only. They can be played as different charismatic rogue types as well. They can be gatherers of lore, or spies and secret agents, and it doesn't stop there. They can be mages, soldiers, scribes, skalds, merchants and ADVENTURERS. This is a fantasy game, and IMO fantasy is the only limitation to what you can roleplay.<br/>\n I have played many bards. One bard I played on a PW was trying to become a violinist. There can be much roleplay revolving around that, and I enjoyed roleplaying that character, much because of the depth of character that developed after roleplaying with other good roleplayers for some time. Well, anyway he was very bad at playing the violin, terribly bad, and he was well known for that. So whenever he equipped the violin (CEP item) and started playing, he played the curse song.<br/>\n \u00a0</div></div>",

Since the guess isn't entirely correct ^^. The problem is the intent isn't for SoU and HoTU, along with (Sands of fate) it's for Amia a lv 30 role-play server. And monk was monk in general I didn't intend to make an RDD anymore since the original intent for it died out as well.</div></div>"
