That is why he cares only about his defenses, although a bit too much i think.<br/>\n<br/>\n David, what do you see in that build that isn't on Mick's one? The higher dexterity perhaps? The build Mick posted already can optimized a bit further and if you start with 19 dexterity you will end up with a final 34 dexterity by the end, which is only a single point of AC behind what you posted just now. And if you follow our instructions and make it a Paladin 26/ Rogue 13/ Monk 1, then Mick's build goes ahead by a whole 7 AC more than \" Fame \" because you can enhance your wisdom too and thus gain AC from there as well. Plus Mick's build has many more attacks and with a really good AB at that. This build has several leveling issues as well, huge XP penalty, no Uncunny Dodge till epics, no ED till almost the end, no damage at all before mid-thirties, low health even for a dexer...This build seems much more appropriate for PvP instant level 40. But on the other hand we know very little about your server, so it might be alright there, you are the final arbiter on that.</div>"

Not a glimmer. All I could find were a few token forums that almost nobody used or maintained, that it is a Mirent Tusk design, buggy as a Cajun swamp, that it is in a constant state of repairs and uses some version of CEP. \u00a0According to what I could gather (which isn't a whole lot), it operates a lot like WoW with\u00a0a simple equipment grab. \u00a0I seriously doubt any AD&amp;D build would have much relevance in that environment.<br/>\n<br/>\n Months ago, I recommended to Kid Miracleman to create an entry in the PW section of ECB for Tornado of Souls, outlining every detail that could possibly impact build suggestions rather than constantly needing to inform potential helpers of them piecemeal.<br/>\n<br/>\n So far, I see nothing.</div></div>"

      "content": "<div>Yeah, pretty much whatever we do have here is obsolete for kidmiracleman's server, NwN engine simply breaks down when the magic level is that high. I was over Sword Coast's server forums the other day ( a linked PW we have here that is a +10 module) and the guys there were wondering if EWS is worth taking into their builds. Now kidmiracleman's server is higher than that, maybe a lot higher and since it is not maintained properly i guess the balance of monster's/player's AB/AC is off by a large margin.<br/>\n<br/>\n David, if by EWF you meant the weapon's choice then you can always take a single Kama with the build Mick provided ( Paladin 26/ Rogue 13/ Monk 1, take last level as Monk instead of Rogue) and have six/seven attacks with it and you will be left with enough feats pre-epic to get improved expertise as well. Really there is not much you can do for your AC beyond that point, is an almost maximum dexterity Halfling with Monk's wisdom to AC and ED/IE/UMD. If that's not enough then nothing will be except a Pale Master at this point.<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"
