I foud it long long time ago on the main \"Epic Characters Builds\" page, but since it has alignment changes, i don't try it. Today i found it again in my old builds bag and decide to make similar build, which has no alignment changes.

      "content": "<div>I'm not sure I understand the significant benefit of a single level of PM.  +2 to AC with +2 fort and will saves (your base saves are well over 40 vs. spells so only the +AC boost is really relevant)?  Or is this a roleplay/theme accommodation?<br/>\n<br/>\nA few questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) How do you intend to cast the level 6 Bard spells... unequip armor/shield?<br/>\n<br/>\n2) The AB is quite low (@28) so hitting foes will be a problem, even average ones, especially in expertise (AB @23) or imp expertise (AB@18).  Perhaps these were taken for when casting in combat?  This seems to be more of a singer/caster than a spellsword, but even a singer has to be able to finish off badly-cursed enemies.  <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps if you posted a link to the build that was your inspiration it would be easier to understand where you want to go with this build.</div>"

I have a tough time DLing images from image shack but I saw enough to recognize where it came from.  As soon as I can procure the full images I hope to understand that single level of PM better.  Temporary inconvenience, permanent improvement.  Stay tuned.</div>"

      "content": "<div>As an alignment shift avoiding version of the Troubadour Guardian, it works.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I'm often perplexed at Bard builds with more than 30 bard levels: this is because bard song stops improving at 30th lvl (and reaching insane prerequisites in the meanwhile) and because of bard not being full fledged spellcasters which means they'll miss out the higher level spells and DCs (ESF is not selectable) and their spell list i snot geared towards having DCs at all to start with. Add that Bard opens up PRCs like PM, RDD and AA, that it synergizes well with BG (and Pally if alignment changes are not an issue) and that it can benefit greatly from further multiclassing and you'll end up with not having room for Bard 30+ easily.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsidering the build itself (and the comments basically apply to the Troubadour Guardian too) In this build Cha is too much of a focus. The AB is crippled unnecessarily in favor of high saves and divine feats which utility becomes debatable given the poor melee performance. The extra spell slots and spell DC granted by high Cha are kinda wasted on a half hearted spellcaster. PM 1 adds +2 AC so it's not out of place given the premises (bard 30+ and BG 4 for divine feats), but seeing Bard 35/PM 1 makes one wonder why not Bard 26/PM 10?<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the level split has to remain, then at least go grab ESF: Perform/Taunt, move PM 1 post Bard 20 so that Bard 20 happens on lvl 24 and you can select Lasting Inspiration earlier, get yourself Craft Wand and possibly Scribe Scroll. If the Cha focus is not so important then get Weapon Feats and pump up Str some more. Drop even Dex to 8 and start with Str 15.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut first of all I have to ask: apart removing an alignment shift from the Troubadour Guardian, is there anything else you want to achieve with this build? That would help focusing the suggestions in the right direction.</div>"
