It's not about the damage he could do, he should just outlive the enemys. Just my feeling but anything like a dwarven fighter might do the trick but i am open to any race and any class without much magic. For example RDD seems ok, with the need of a little bit of bard or sorcerer but he is afaik not a caster himself. Correct me if I am wrong.<br/>\nHe should reach lvl 40 in the end.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You can find him on the first page of the Full Epic sub-forum - Hip Maestro is billed as his creator, but it's actually an old build by Grizzled Dwarflord that Hip imported here. There's a link in the lead post to a reworking that I did to take into account patch 1.69, and I'd suggest you go for that. I've played him many times and have yet to have him go toes-up on me. The veritable immovable object.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sure others will have different suggestions for you.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If however, you intend to play in medium-magic PW's or similar then a (fighter/bard/pale master) is really tough, followed closely by (fighter/bard/rdd) and dwarven defenders. Another choice that works better in high-ish magic environments is a dexterity-based character with epic dodge &amp; self-concealment, those are really hard to hit (in melee at least) and again spell-slingers a monk is a good idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you see, there are many options, you just have to narrowed it down to the ones you prefer and then we can help you decide whats best for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor reference, here is a tough rdd for you in case you wanted an example.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#CC0000\"><strong>Drago Mauler</strong></span> =&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/draco-mauler-ftr-10-bard-4-rdd-26-t2352276.html#p612\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">draco-mauler-ftr-10-bard-4-rdd-26-t2352276.html#p612</a><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If you get the official expansions (Shadows of Undrentide and Hordes of the Underdark), they're not a continuation of the OC and should be played with a new character from level 1. They'll get you to about level 28. If you want to take a character all the way to level 40 in modules (rather than Persistent Worlds), you might want to pay a trip to the Neverwinter Vault and grab the 3 parts of Mines of Twin Summit (which is ideal for taking you from the end of the OC comfortably up to level 40) and Sands of Fate (which will do likewise from the end of HotU). If you've been playing a Good-aligned Human, Elf or Half-Elf character in the OC, Aribeth's Redemption might appeal (which will get you from level 17/18 to about level 28). Alternatively, if you want your character to progress as far as possible within a single story, Aielund will take you from level 1 up to about level 36/37.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, all in all this is me batting your request back to you until you've settled on how far you want your character to progress, lest we provide a toon that doesn't mature until its too late for you.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope this helps, and doesn't merely confuse!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Skill points - the bracketed ones - reflect the result of those points you place in them (the non-bracketed ones). And each one is reliant for pluses and minuses on your atttributes/stats. Thus, Spellcraft relies upon your Intelligence score, Discipline your Stength, Tumble your Dexterity, and so on. So, for example, if you finish with a Strength score of 40, you'll get at least (other feats and equipment not included) 15 points added to your Discipline final score. The same applies downward - such that if you have a Dexterity of 8, you will get a minus 1 to your Tumble skill points, meaning if you invest 40 skill points in that skill, you'll end up with 39.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. However, some of the skills require a certain number of points invested to be effective, whereas others don't, and rely on post-modification numbers. For example, Tumble requires that you input 40 points in order to gain 8 AC, because it works on inputted points, even if you end up with 39. Spellcraft, however, relies on modified points, so - assuming a character with a stat of 8 in Intelligence, you'd need to input 41 points to get the 40 (modified) required to boost the saves against spells by that extra 1.<br/>\n<br/>\nHope that helps. Many of the skills work in multiples of five to bring a desired effect. Many others don't, and they're a right pain in the arse, but we can go into that further in the General Discussion forum, should you wish, Grom. We can also cover saving skill points and cross-classing them if you like, but I reckon that's probably enough for now.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading this back, I'm not surprised in the slightest that you choose to build on the hoof <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
