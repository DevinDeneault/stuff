      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hail, ECBers!<br/>\n<br/>\n You have recently seen some great builds by WhiZard and Mick Dagger respectively that take advantage of Monk 3 removing the speed cap and therefore allowing multiple \"haste effects\" or rather, Expeditious Retreat and a Haste effect other than the Haste Spell (so basically perma-haste and Expeditious Retreat, Mass Haste and Expeditious Retreat or two instances of Expeditious Retreat) to stack with one another. They use this to be able to cast and run. I was inspired by the idea to create a similar concept of build, but instead of arcane casters, I obviously went for Cleric. Why Cleric? Well, first, it's a Cleric / Monk and NO Cleric / Monk is weak. Second, there is Zen Archery, which makes it so that you can cast AND snipe from far away with the same stat and be very good at it thanks to Clerical buffs. And last, Monk Wisdom AC makes him much harder to hit even by snipers, and the Spell Resistance spell makes you very good against casters, so you're good against all enemy types. Basically, this toon is a Speedy Gonzalez POWERHOUSE.<br/>\n<br/>\n I would like to give my public thanks to WhiZard, the man who not only devised the first build that inspired this one, but also patiently and thoroughly explained the stacking mechanism to me via PM. Thanks, mate!<br/>\n<br/>\n Well, if you want to know what this guy is capable of, look below!<br/>\n<br/>\n Cleric(26), Monk(3), Wizard(11), Human<br/>\n<br/>\n Alignment: Any Lawful<br/>\n<br/>\n

Scribed Scroll (or spell, but not enough per day, so you have to have a supply) until he gets a perma-haste item, and many Expeditious Retreats, regular and extended as well as from scrolls depending on how long he wants them to last. Cleric buffs are indispellable only at lvl 38, but since you shouldn't allow enemies to cast, it's not very relevant. You shouldn't have any problems leveling him.

However, this guy isn't JUST a sniper, he's an EXCELLENT Archer, but also a very good Divine Caster. Implosion DC of 42, which is very good for a sniper .<br/>\n<br/>\nHis AB is easy: Just add 26 to his AB with capped WIS and Clerical buffs (+5 Divine Power, +5 Divine Favor, +5 GMW (which works on bows where I play), +1 Bless, +1 Aid, +1 Prayer and +2 Battletide). So 41 + 26 = 67, which is this build's capped AB total, feel free to not consider WIS items for a low magic server, in that case it'd be around 63/64 depending on Empowered Owl's Wisdom roll and if you want you can also take out the GMW spell, in which case the build would fluctuate at around 58-60 AB on its own.<br/>\n<br/>\nAC calculations:<br/>\n<br/>\n10<br/>\n+3 DEX<br/>\n+12 WIS<br/>\n+5 MV Robe<br/>\n+5 Barkskin<br/>\n+5 Shield of Faith<br/>\n+6 Tumble<br/>\n+4 Haste<br/>\n+1 Mage Armor<br/>\n+6 Capped DEX (needs a couple of items)<br/>\n+6 Capped WIS (also needs a couple of items)<br/>\n-----------------<br/>\n63 AC<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can add +5 Monk Boots to that total for 68 AC, 50% concealment with Trickery domain. On WoG there are also Shield bracers, which add +4 Shield AC, for 72 total AC (actually 71 because the best boots in the server only give +4 Dodge AC, not +5, but they make you immune to KDs ).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for damage, on WoG you can Darkfire arrowstacks and when you cast GMW on a bow, it adds Mighty +X where X equals the enhancement added to the bow that way, which makes your Divine Power do full damage to enemies after level 15. However, in a standard NWN world, it'd depend on whether Mighty bows were available at all, the enhancement level of the bows, as well as the types of arrows available, since most non-AA archers rely on those or Sneaks to do damage and this one has no sneaks. I'd say that against some kinds of enemies, your best bet is to melee with them (DR mobs for example) with a Kama. You'll have a lower AB, but more attacks per round and a full arsenal of Cleric spells at your disposal. If everything fails, cast an Implosion.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">It is hard to go wrong with cleric. He will fire 6 arrows per round with rapid shot, haste and divine power.  Divine favor, prayer and battletide also add to the damage. I see how it benefits archers when you can buff ranged weapons and missiles with GMW and darkfire/flameweapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nChoosing the right number of wizard levels can be a bit tricky. You may want more levels for more spellslots and longer duration, and you may even want 13 or 14 levels for extended mass haste for the full haste effects, but then again once you have access to perma haste items you will be well served with casting one single expeditious retreat at a time. In your build 11 wizard levels seem like a fine compromise. You get to cast mass haste and can build up a stack of scrolls if you want. You have room for the necessary 3 monk levels and get 2 epic bonus feats from the 26 cleric levels. <br/>\nTry giving your character a wand (or other item) with unlimited casting of expeditious retreat! You can toolkit one or make one in a trainer module. A double casting of the spell makes you cross the largest areas in no time at all, and you never run out of the spell! It almost feels like cheating (and it probably is).    <br/>\nSorry to say you can not craft wands of expeditious retreat with the craft wand feat.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

My biggest problem comes with deciding how many wizard levels to take. In Max' build 11 wizard levels is given by Monk 3 and Cleric 26, and it's an all right choice since you get lvl 6 spells and can learn mass haste.<br/>\n I found out that it is possible to get by with 6 wizard levels (W6/M4/AA10 pre-epic) and have several castings of extended expeditious retreat (they stack with each other and with perma haste from items) for 12 rounds of joy.<br/>\n The next step is 11 levels like max takes, but I like 13 levels even better for extended mass haste and the longer duration. Taking even more wizard levels is also possible and gives more spellpower, but building up wizard eats AA levels and demands investment in Intelligence rather than Dexterity. It is hard to find synergy and a sweet-spot level distribution here. But like I said, most of the builds perform quite well.<br/>\n A fun thing to do was to toolkit an item/wand with unlimited casting of expeditious retreat. Use it with any monk build that has 3 monk levels or more and see the character fly faster and faster as the casted spells stack. It's a gamebreaker, really.<br/>\n I'll have a second look at the builds and see if I can find one worth posting. (Better stop here before I hijack the thread.)<br/>\n<em>Edit</em>: Here is a link to my <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2354296/Arcane-Speedarcher-Monk-6-Wizard-13-Arcane-Archer-21\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Arcane Speedarcher</a></div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
