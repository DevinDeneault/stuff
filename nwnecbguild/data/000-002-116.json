      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">WASD only makes you flatfooted if you're not moving much, but that applies to clicking as well. The problem is that WASD doesn't have the automatic pathfinding that clicking does, so your character can get stuck on mobs during combat and become flatfooted. Running into or away from combat with WASD works exactly the same as clicking.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally I use WASD outside of combat and clicking during combat if I need to reposition.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

WASD works the same as clicking provided that you're actually moving.
