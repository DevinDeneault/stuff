For example, a character with one base class and any number of prestige classes (such as a 10th-level rogue/3rd-level shadowdancer/7th-level assassin) will not suffer any XP penalties no matter what race the character is. Similarly, a character with levels in a favored base class and at most one other base class (and possibly levels in a prestige class) will not suffer any XP penalties. However, a character with two non-favored base classes could suffer a -20% penalty; this character will not, though, suffer a -40% penalty, even if the character has levels in a prestige class. A -40% penalty can only occur when a character has three base classes (and only when those classes are not nearly the same level).<br/>\nIn version 1.69, a human or half-elf with a prestige class would never suffer a multiclass penalty, as one of the base classes would always be favored. This is no longer the case in the Enhanced Edition. For example, a human 6th-level fighter/4th-level paladin/7th-level champion of Torm will have two non-favored base classes and one favored prestige class. The non-favored base class levels differ by more than one, so there is a -20% XP penalty.\"<br/>\n<br/>\nI actually am the one who first put it on the Wiki.\u00a0 I was building a PAL9/SOR1/RDD30 for kicks and noticed as I was playing HOTU that he got an XP Penalty at RDD10.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em class=\"mention\">@webshaman1</em>\u00a0- It's the oddest thing!\u00a0 On my Windows PC running EE on Steam, leveling a Paladin or Ranger with &lt;11 WIS is not a problem.\u00a0 However, on my iPad version of EE (from the Apple Store), I can't do it.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT - apparently, it's been fixed.\u00a0 Never mind on that part.<br/>\n<br/>\nWRT some builds I loved (Hammer Knight Empyreal, etc.) that were heavy on Prestige Classes, maybe the universe of people who care is too small to worry about.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
