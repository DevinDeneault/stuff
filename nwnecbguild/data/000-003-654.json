      "content": "<div>Hi guys.<br/>\nFirst of all I would like to congratulate you for this wonderful forum, it is so nice to see so many people still discussing and love one of the most beautiful role-playing games ever created. Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs per request, since I'm not good at building characters, if possible I would like to have a build for a server that is just being born.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe server is low magic, I don't know exactly, but I believe with maximum bonus +3 weapons. As you may have guessed, the level cap is 20, and there is only one rule, the prestige classes, if you wanted to take it, must have at least 10 levels. To be clear, the administrators want to avoid taking for example 1 level of shadowdancer just to have the advantage of hips.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, the class I love most, especially for roleplay is the <strong>Ranger</strong>, but let's say that the forest classes have more fun. I really like the style of Legolas, with bow and double swords if necessary, but I am open to any suggestions. Even to a druid fighter maybe.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a good elf I hate dwarves, and I prefer the race to be <strong>human</strong> or <strong>elven</strong>.<br/>\nI'm a purist, I don't even like classes based on dexterity with sword and shield or in general shields.<br/>\nDo you think you can make a good build?<br/>\nAh, even a coffee thanks. : D: D Joke, sorry for too many requests.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Thank you all for your attention! &lt;3</strong></div>"

You also don't need to don heavy armour or wear a shield, but that might be more of an issue, as your AC will be severely gimped in melee. Equally, I'm not sure dropping a level of Fighter would be better than dropping one of Bard. With one you lose a bonus feat, with the other your skills dumps will be further apart and you lose a level of song. Hmm...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you'd prefer a Ranger dex build who both shoots and dual-wields you also run into issues. Yes, your archery will be better and so will your natural AC, but the number of feats at your disposal will be sorely diminished. You'll have 7. That will cover Weapon Finesse (to improve your melee AB), 2 Weapon Focuses (Longbow and Shortsword are your best bet), Blind Fight, Knockdown, and probably Improved Critical in both your chosen weapons. That's 7, and you lose out on Improved Knockdown. You'd also need at least 9 levels of Ranger to get ITWF, and if you want AA, then that leaves 1 level to qualify for the class. If, as I presume, you'd prefer Elf, then you'd need to take Wizard to avoid an xp penalty, which would mean any Tumble AC would have to be cross-classed, so ending in +2AC rather than +4. Also, with no Uncanny Dodge or Evasion you're particularly susceptible to sneaks, which is a huge bummer in Dex builds.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou present a worthy challenge, Deniedz! We'll work on it...<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and welcome to the Guild!<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: Ninja'd by Grimnir - but more importantly, as a massive Dwarf fan, I'm losing sight of why I'd want to help...<span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83d\ude09</span></div>",

      "content": "<div>First of all thank you guys for the answers. <strong>Stagmeister</strong>, of course what I wrote is my dream, but I am aware of the limits of dreams in Nwn\u00a0<span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83d\ude02</span>\u00a0<br/>\nObviously in a game like this, you cannot be strong both in swords and with a bow, and you cannot also have a good defense, I am aware that something must be given up. What I would like is a <strong>Hunter</strong> who is supportive of the bow for others, but who can go in melee with the two swords when he is alone. It is obviously <strong>not a PVP build</strong>, but a very role-playing game, so if I had to choose between the two weapons, I prefer to be stronger in melee, and use the bow only in some situations. Thanks anyway to everyone for the interest.<br/>\n<br/>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Deniedz wrote:</cite>EDIT: Ninja'd by Grimnir - but more importantly, as a massive Dwarf fan, I'm losing sight of why I'd want to help...<span class=\"text-emoji\">\ud83d\ude09</span></div></blockquote>\nAhaha...\u00a0\"What about side by side with a friend?\"\u00a0</div>"
