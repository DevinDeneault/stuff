      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">G'day everyone,<br/>\n<br/>\nI am going to give WoG a go and I looked through the Greyhawk Pantheon to get inspiration. This story popped into my head...<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>He sat cross-legged on the blood-soaked grass, her head in his lap, watching the house, burn.</em><br/>\n<em>The acrid smell of fire, ash and death hung around him like a cloak.</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>As an apprentice blacksmith, he should have been long gone at dawn to prepare the village forge.</em><br/>\n<em>But something, at the back of his mind, encouraged him to linger a little longer at home with his new wife.</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>The dawn assault by the goblins was fast. He slew two with his Morningstar, in a cacophony of bone-crushing destruction.</em><br/>\n<em>The house was fired; he blindly staggered outside, shielding his terrified young bride from the heat. </em><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>A misshapen malcontent ran at him in the smoke. The Morningstar flayed the goblin, which fertilised the field with a fresh blood.</em><br/>\n<em>Something fast rattled past his ear. The sling bullet meant for him struck her in face...</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>...The Priest of Saint Cuthbert surveyed the aftermath. He was not here to provide succor for a mountain village after a Goblin attack.</em><br/>\n<em>He was here for him, an old soul in a new body, paying penance for the past. He briefly questioned his master's reasons, before instantly quashing the thought. </em><br/>\n<br/>\n<em>No, he was here for a divine purpose.</em><br/>\n<em>He was here for the Retributor.</em><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am hoping a simple warrior/rogue build with a twist would be a fun way to start in the World of Greyhawk.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Retributor is\u00a0 related to the Dark Prince No Dev Crit build <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build255432.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/buil ... 55432.html</a><br/>\nThe differences are:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Retributors get to use Crippling Strike earlier;<br/>\n- Dark Prince has Divine Might;<br/>\n- Retributor has significantly better Will saves;<br/>\n- Retributor has more Rogue levels, with an emphasis on the search / disable traps / open locks skills<br/>\n- Dark Prince suggests a Greatsword, Retributor uses Morningstar and Tower Shield<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Morningstar provides dual piercing/bludgeoning damage (d8), using the higher damage type. I am hoping the investment into weapon focus and specialisation can be applied to two different physical damage types. The downside of the Morningstar is the 20 threat range and x2 crit multiplier. So instead, the idea is to deliver damage via poison, crippling strike and sneak attacks. The Retributor does not strike from shadows, so Blackguard summons, summons from UMD scrolls, or knocking a foe prone are the ways to deliver the pain.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Retributor has the BAB to engage in direct combat and can self-buff with stacking Bull's Strength. The full suite of search / disable traps / open locks skills will allow the Retributor to negotiate traps and Spot will provide warning of hidden enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe downside is no Dev Crit, no Epic damage reduction and the build only reaches fruition in the mid 20's. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlease let me know if the Retributor will be OK for WoG and is it suitable for epic levels?\u00a0 <br/>\n<br/>\nI would also welcome your suggestions on how to improve it :-)<br/>\n<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>\n\n\u00a0\nDEX: 10\nWIS: 10\nCHA: 14 (16)\nHuman: (Quick to Master)\n02: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus: Morning Star\n04: Fighter(2): STR+1, Cleave, (STR=16)\n06: Fighter(3): Blind Fight\n08: Fighter(4): CON+1, Weapon Specialization: Morning Star, (CON=15)\n10: Blackguard(2): {Smite Good}\n12: Blackguard(3): CON+1, Toughness, (CON=16)\n14: Rogue(6)\n16: Blackguard(6): CHA+1, (CHA=15)\n18: Blackguard(7): Improved Knockdown\n20: Rogue(8): CHA+1, (CHA=16)\n22: Fighter(6): Epic Weapon Specialization: Morning Star\n24: Rogue(10): STR+1, Epic Will, Crippling Strike, (STR=17)\n26: Blackguard(10)\n28: Blackguard(12): STR+1, (STR=19)\n30: Blackguard(13): Great Strength II, Epic Prowess, (STR=20)\n32: Blackguard(15): STR+1, (STR=21)\n34: Rogue(12)\n36: Blackguard(18): STR+1, Great Strength IV, (STR=24)\n38: Blackguard(20)\n40: Blackguard(21): STR+1, (STR=26)\nHitpoints: 508\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 30/26/23\nBAB: 28\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 19/30\nAlignment Changes: 0\nAppraise 10(12), Disable Trap 42(44), Discipline 40(48), Heal 14(14), Hide 5(5), Listen 4(4), Lore 20(22), Open Lock 42(42), Search 42(44), Spot 24(24), Tumble 35(35), UMD 33(36)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n02: Discipline(4), Lore(1), \n04: Discipline(2), Heal(1), Lore(1), Save(1), \n06: Discipline(3), Save(2), \n08: Discipline(2), Heal(1), Lore(1), Save(1), \n10: Discipline(1), Save(8), \n12: Discipline(2), Lore(1), Save(2), \n14: Appraise(1), Disable Trap(3), Open Lock(3), Search(3), Spot(2), Tumble(3), UMD(2), \n16: Save(7), \n18: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Save(2), \n20: Disable Trap(3), Open Lock(3), Search(3), Spot(2), Tumble(3), UMD(3), \n22: Discipline(1), Save(5), \n24: Appraise(1), Disable Trap(1), Open Lock(1), Search(1), Spot(2), Tumble(1), UMD(4), \n26: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Save(3), \n28: Discipline(1), Save(11), \n30: Discipline(2), Lore(1), Save(2), \n32: Discipline(1), Lore(1), Save(7), \n34: Disable Trap(5), Open Lock(5), Search(5), Spot(1), Tumble(4), UMD(2), \n36: Discipline(1), Heal(1), Lore(1), Save(3), \n38: Save(12), \n40: Discipline(3), Heal(1), Lore(1),</details><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Tumble is now 40 and Improved knockdown is now earlier in the build. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm going think about CHA though, as the higher universal saves from Dark Blessing is the \"participation award\" for no Dev crit... <br/>\n<br/>\nI've also had epiphany that Divine Might may be a worthwhile option, as it ignores damage resistance and damage immunity. That adds to the Morningstar's mystique of differing damage types in the same weapon. <br/>\n<br/>\nOrion, thanks for the playtested executioner build, that is a beast! You should seriously consider putting it into the 40's section.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
