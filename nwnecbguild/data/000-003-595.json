I wanted a pure-as-possible monk and started from monk40 (speed, UA damage, SR), but Epic Dodge and Self-Concealment were highly desired.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nElf for the Dexterity bump. Shadowdancer gets me Epic Dodge. Harper came from searching for a 3rd flavor to add (monk35/SD5 seemed strong), it let me squeeze in SCV and an extra +1 dexterity. This was at the cost of some monk speed and AC, stunning fist DC, 10 SR...<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like it is a bit stronger with the Harper Scout added, but less of a dedicated Mage killer maybe?<br/>\n<br/>\nOpinions?

But not 100% sure.<br/>\nIf you dropped it you have lots of choices, rogue seems nice for 1d6-3d6 sneak attack damage combined with 5-7 APR.\u00a0 Fighter 5 you can get epic weapon specialization if you take EWS as a general epic feat on a fighter 5 level.\u00a0Multiclass penalty with both, assassin and CoT/Blackguard/Arcane Archer (for BAB 26+) being alternatives to dodge the multiclass penalties.<br/>\nRE Epic Level Feats - I like Epic Prowess and Armor Skin. The other feats could be Improved Spell Resistance, Epic Fortitude (those darn Implosions that go through death immunity, although with that monk speed you *could* kind of dodge them, if you aren't mobbed), even toughness / great constitution to push the base HP closer to 400 for a meleer. Up to you what you like really. Epic Energy Resistances depend on the environment and what you are facing.\u00a0<br/>\nRE UMD - its a powerful skill<br/>\nRE Assassin - can understand the issues with being an evil assassin monk<br/>\n<br/>\nTumble can be 40 ranks in the build rather than 43 btw<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Edit:</strong>\u00a0The Harper Cat's Grace Feat (but not crafted potion) appeared to stack with standard Cat's Grace spell/potion when I playtested it in July 2019 preparing <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/brew-potion-craft-harper-item-craft-wand-scribe-sc-t2355097.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this guide</a>.\u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
