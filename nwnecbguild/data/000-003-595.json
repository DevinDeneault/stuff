      "content": "<div>Not having the time to write the build, but off the top of my head, I would go with something like Sorcerer 30/ Fighter 6/ Blackguard 4 &amp; replace BG with Paladin for Jedi Masters like Mace Windu, to better represent the \"power in the force\". Perhaps Sorc 32/ Ftr 4/ BG 4 even, depending on the epic spellcasting feats. Orion's build is also a good take on them if you go for raw power instead, few things can match an RDD build. <br/>\nI remember this concept has appeared in WoG forums as well, from what I remember they went with Sorc/Monk/Ftr instead, which is an interesting approach too. If you search a little on their build section I'm sure you'll find the thread.</div>"
