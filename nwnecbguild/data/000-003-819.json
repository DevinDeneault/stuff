It's an interesting server as far as mechanics go. Makes for a good read:\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://wiki.arelith.com/Category:Classes\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://wiki.arelith.com/Category:Classes</a><br/>\n<br/>\nI'm currently running a pure Wizard but am looking for something more melee as my character spends most of his time behind his summons not even casting.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nRules:\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n- Max Level 30<br/>\n- Any class taken must be a minimum of 3 consecutively (can take them any were after you get that minimum)<br/>\n- Cannot use Shifter, Assassin, Harper or RDD<br/>\n- No alignment shifts (there is a few special rules around alignment. EG Bards can be lawful)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso there is a coupe of \"extra\" classes like the spellsword.</div>"
