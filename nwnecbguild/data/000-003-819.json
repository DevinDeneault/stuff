      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Someone told me \"Oh, the best DPS build, or at least top three, is the 6 fighter/7 weapon master/27 assasain strength build with a scythe\".<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I'm sure it's good, but I don't really think I should try to build it from the ground myself. I checked the lvl40 forums, but the closest thing I found was this:<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=2354412&amp;p=801&amp;hilit=assassin+weapon+master+fighter#p801\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=2354412&amp;p=801&amp;hilit ... ghter#p801</a><br/>\nAlso, I would hesitate to make something other than what Valerfor created, without good reason.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, if I could get some help (again), I would be grateful. I have a toon that I've grown tired of, and I'm thinking I should try something new and I've NEVER played an assassin before. So, do I go with the unnamed contributor for 27 assassin, or follow in the Master's footsteps with 21 assassin?<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, side note: You get d6 acid damage per every three level assassin on Blackstone, which might explain the 27 assassin, compare to Valefor's 21 assassin. Also, I'm not very good at sneaking, I prefer to walk up to someone and trip them, then hit them while they're lying down. Not very sportsmanlike, but effective...<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Others would suggest just forgo assassin and use rogue. These arguments have merit.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour world seems to give even more reason to go all out with assassin. The build of Valefor's that you link, you could go scythe instead of Greataxe, you'd just have to get that weapon proficiency exotic in, probably early, rearrange some fights, probably take blind fight later in place of Iron will.\u00a0 That's an approach I would consider. Or drop great fortitude. This of course opens up the little can of beans of what one would do with the corresponding epic feat (i.e. either epic will, or epic fortitude).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI just can't stand the way scythes look, or from the real life perspective of how bad they are as a weapon, especially as portrayed in fantasy.<br/>\n<br/>\nBtw, the strength based assassin could be considered more of an advanced users assassin....<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Do that build in cbc &amp; you will get at least 1ab lower, not to mention that you will have to sacrifice an epic general feat to get ews on that 7th ftr level. If you want max dps, drop the save boosters &amp; even armor skin (since you go all-out), start with 18 str &amp; get to 34 str. That's how you get 46ab out of it. <br/>\n<br/>\nDeath attack dc, we know it plays very small role in bsk (due to constant true sight &amp; high-saves) of the monsters there, otherwise, i would advice going for the higher assassin levels, but i optimize for the environment.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I've been trying out your assassin build. It's awesome. I actually modified it a bit, removed the saves (since I can Forge those in game, I can add +2 universal to every item I have equipped) and added DevCrit instead (which now is modified in BSK to give double the damage). I was also extremely lucky and managed to make an uber Dwarven WarAxe. So, now I hit for around 60 points. When I sneak/knockdown I get around 100ish, but the DevCrit gives 250-500 per hit. I hit once for 505 points. That was kinda nice. In game I have AC65, so it's not quite a glass jaw dps either.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo sum it up, your build with the extreme axe I was lucky to make (well, buy for 17 million then forge) is so overpowered. It's great fun! Later today I'm gonna take on one of the high-end raid areas where I've never dared to set my foot alone.<br/>\n<br/>\nI checked out the other build, but it's very feat-starved and hence it's not easy to get DevCrit or Exotic weapon on it. I vote Valerfor regardless.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
