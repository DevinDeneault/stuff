      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hello All,<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n This build started life as an idea I'd had for a Hin Monk/Rogue/CoT Dexer. My motives were not the purest: I found that every time I tried a Dexer, I reverted to Mick Dagger's awesome <strong>Halfling Champion</strong> (R20/Cot14/F6), so I thought I'd try for something different that I could play - and if others could as well, so much the better. In a way, it's different from other builds I've posted, in that this one really doesn't get full maturity until later levels, but it's definitely playable throughout (tested to the end of Aielund - level 37), just with a little more caution early on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Looking through the Legacy Archive, I found 3 similar builds: Empyre65's <strong>Skilled Monk</strong> (M21/R13/CoT6), ManOWar's <strong>Ninja of Torm</strong> (M20/R10/CoT10), and Sidious Fell's M20/CoT13/R7 - although this one ended up after discussion being Syrath1001's M20/R10/CoT10. The only one of these that was a halfling build was this last one, the other two being human, and Empyre's also has an Unarmed Strike focus, although is probably the closest to mine in conceptual terms. In the ECB Filter, Valerfor's <strong><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2354310/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hin-Hurricane Ironman Ed.</a></strong> (M25/R5/F10) was the only one that appeared of comparable intent.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n The original draft - preliminary version - can be found within the spoiler at the bottom of this post, so that the discussion that follows makes at least some sense.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>ARVOREEN'S SILENT STING</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n Monk 21 / Rogue 13 / CoT 6<br/>\n<br/>\n Halfling - Lawful, non-Evil<br/>\n<br/>\n PvM 1-40<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>VITALS</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n STR 12<br/>\n<br/>\n DEX 18 (32)<br/>\n<br/>\n CON 14<br/>\n<br/>\n WIS 10<br/>\n<br/>\n INT 14<br/>\n<br/>\n CHA 8<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n HPs: 386<br/>\n<br/>\n SPs: 310 - Disable Trap 22 (26), Discipline 43 (47), Hide 42 (57), Listen 42 (48), Move Silently 40 (57), Open Lock 1 (12), Search 5 (7), Set Trap 5 (18), Spellcraft 18 (20), Tumble 40 (51), UMD 34 (33)<br/>\n<br/>\n AC: 36 (naked) +1 Dodge / 36 (armour+shield) +1 Dodge<br/>\n<br/>\n Saves: Fortitude 28 / Will 23 / Reflex 41 (all +4 vs Spells, +2 vs Mind Effects, +2 vs Fear, +2 vs Traps).

Tried to get to Monk 6 asap without delaying rogue levels too much.<br/>\n<br/>\n 2.\u00a0 ED asap, Level 27.<br/>\n<br/>\n 3. Last rogue dump at Lvl 31 to assure net UMD of 33, adequate to cast all scrolls without failure.<br/>\n<br/>\n Any more UMD is unnecessary.\u00a0 Monk's won't be using either class-specific armor, shield or weaponry so, generally-speaking, gear valued over 1M gold will never become an issue.\u00a0 Your main use will be scrolls, wands and rods.\u00a0 There may be the occasional class-specific cap, cloak or jewelry item but I am betting the value never breaches the 1M level.<br/>\n<br/>\n 4.\u00a0 The choice between Mnk21/Rog13 and Mnk20/Rog14 is fairly straight-forward: [+10% move speed, +1 SR and 2 HP] vs. [4 skill points and +1 saves vs. traps].\u00a0 Universal saves won't change.\u00a0 Seems automatic to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n 5. I do like the idea of STR14 for a DEXer.\u00a0 In point of fact, that's usually what I strive for.\u00a0 But there is a cost for so few levels of CoT and that extra Grt DEX is expensive (No AS).\u00a0 STR12 is about all I could manage and you certainly don't want to lower WIS AC.\u00a0 I'd rethink your starting spread, Stagmeister.<br/>\n<br/>\n 6.\u00a0 My rogue skill allocation assures to be able to recover and set all deadly traps but the gas type.\u00a0 Unless it is a dedicated trapper, I never waste points on traps that have such poor DCs like those gas have.\u00a0 But they can still be disarmed at this level.\u00a0 Only Search is a bit neglected which means you should NOT charge into areas likely trapped using monk speed.\u00a0 If you are using stealth by default, it should be fine. Shift that lonely point from Locks over if you are so possessed. If there are pockets to pick, perhaps even lower Search another point to get it.<br/>\n<br/>\n 7. This Discipline is not horrible for a DEXer and well worth the investment.\u00a0 Only very high AB KD/disarm attempts will land.<br/>\n<br/>\n 8. Just beware of taunters. They will mostly succeed in lowering your AC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And when they do, run around a corner, enter stealth and try to spam multiple hits within a round of Crippling Strikes.\u00a0 The AB they gained will disappear quickly once that nasty monk APR connects.<br/>\n<br/>\n All you guys come up with kewl build names.\u00a0 Mine always suck.\u00a0 Is there a 3-credit elective I could take to learn to be more \"creative\"? <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><br/>\n<br/>\n edit: ooops!\u00a0 Just realised you took Wpn Finesse illegally.\u00a0 It requires BAB +1 so only warrior types can take it on level 1.<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Last rogue dump at Lvl 31 to assure net UMD of 33, adequate to cast all scrolls without failure.<br/>\n<br/>\n Any more UMD is unnecessary.\u00a0 Monk's won't be using either class-specific armor, shield or weaponry so, generally-speaking, gear valued over 1M gold will never become an issue.\u00a0 Your main use will be scrolls, wands and rods.\u00a0 There may be the occasional class-specific cap, cloak or jewelry item but I am betting the value never breaches the 1M level.<br/>\n<br/>\n 4.\u00a0 The choice between Mnk21/Rog13 and Mnk20/Rog14 is fairly straight-forward: [+10% move speed, +1 SR and 2 HP] vs. [4 skill points and +1 saves vs. traps].\u00a0 Universal saves won't change.\u00a0 Seems automatic to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n 5. I do like the idea of STR14 for a DEXer.\u00a0 In point of fact, that's usually what I strive for.\u00a0 But there is a cost for so few levels of CoT and that extra Grt DEX is expensive (No AS).\u00a0 STR12 is about all I could manage and you certainly don't want to lower WIS AC.\u00a0 I'd rethink your starting spread, Stagmeister.<br/>\n<br/>\n 6.\u00a0 My rogue skill allocation assures to be able to recover and set all deadly traps but the gas type.\u00a0 Unless it is a dedicated trapper, I never waste points on traps that have such poor DCs like those gas have.\u00a0 But they can still be disarmed at this level.\u00a0 Only Search is a bit neglected which means you should NOT charge into areas likely trapped using monk speed.\u00a0 If you are using stealth by default, it should be fine. Shift that lonely point from Locks over if you are so possessed. If there are pockets to pick, perhaps even lower Search another point to get it.<br/>\n<br/>\n 7. This Discipline is not horrible for a DEXer and well worth the investment.\u00a0 Only very high AB KD/disarm attempts will land.<br/>\n<br/>\n 8. Just beware of taunters. They will mostly succeed in lowering your AC.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And when they do, run around a corner, enter stealth and try to spam multiple hits within a round of Crippling Strikes.\u00a0 The AB they gained will disappear quickly once that nasty monk APR connects.<br/>\n<br/>\n All you guys come up with kewl build names.\u00a0 Mine always suck.\u00a0 Is there a 3-credit elective I could take to learn to be more \"creative\"? <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" />. Oh, and in case you didn't get it, Arvoreen's Silent Sting acronyms as ASS.<br/>\n<br/>\n Finally, having previously persuaded me to leave Imp 2-Weapon Fighting until late in the day or omit it entirely (granted, not in a Monk kama build), you go and take it 4 levels before me!

Understood, with a starting DEX of 18 that's bang on. I tried all sorts of starting stats combos - all had CHA at 8; some were CON 12, others 14; some INT 12, others 14; WIS went from 8 to 10 and 12, then back again; STR was always 13 or 14; and DEX always 17 or 18. I settled on low WIS (8) because, unlike DEX, it has no negative impact on Monk AC, and kept STR at 14 because I was desperate for damage (as a traditional STR builder/user) and wasn't really seeing any in the absence of WS/EWS. It was a sort of comfort blanket.<div align=\"left\">\n -- clip --<br/>\n<br/>\n 5. See my <strong>2</strong>., above.

Admittedly, a \"complete\" UMD portfolio won't be achieved until 1 later level, and my Will save will suffer by 1, but is that all? As to the lack of Armour Skin, yes, I recognise the lack of 2 AC is costly, but with a naked AC of 34, does it really make that big a difference when set beside an extra point of damage per successful attack?

If I'm building a Dexer, that's what I should be building. And what are the biggies for DEX meleers? Epic Dodge and stonking AC, together with lots of blows delivered. Your build gets ED earlier than my first stab and has better AC, as well as earlier Crippling Strike, so what's not to like?<br/>\n<br/>\n And double thanks for getting the build to Monk 20 by the mid thirties - yes, I do like me some Perfect Self. I figure that if I'm investing in at least 12 levels of Monk, it seems a bit like cutting your nose off to spite your face not to take it to 20.<br/>\n<br/>\n To a certain extent there is a law of diminishing returns with only 6 levels of CoT (particularly with negative CHA), but I didn't fancy the XP penalty of taking Fighter (makes more of a difference in SP than PWs, I would think), and Weapon Master needed a whole other set of feats I didn't have room for. I did some head-scratching about Shadow Dancer, but - other than HiPS - I thought there would be too much duplication with Rogue and Monk (eg, I'd have Evasion 3 times over). Bard song would also have been nice, but at the end of the day I knew I needed a couple of bonus feats pre-epic and at least 1 in epic, so CoT it was.<br/>\n<br/>\n I'll do some cannibalising of your build and feed it into my draft, if that's okay? I'd feel a bit of a fraud lodging it on the Full Epic forum (after I do some proper testing, of course), but I might get away with it if I give proper credit.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">This is just by way of an incidental, but I've just spent 3 hours working on the skills distribution by level - and loved it (apart from when my maths buggered things up, of course). I know, I know, it's sad, and could be much easier using these new-fangled lectronixy things, but there's a lot to be said for just sitting there and mulling over priorities. And I'll apologise because many if not all of you know this stuff - I'm just in a sharing mood. That, and I'm giving a rallying cry for pnp - thinking is important!<br/>\n<br/>\n For instance, when one starts to grasp that 310 skill points ain't enough for what you want, you have to think about why you do want certain skills, and when you want them. In this instance (and using Hip's earlier, very good allocation), I finally decided that my Big Four unassailables were Discipline, Spellcraft, Tumble and UMD - and they would feature whenever they could, up to any finite level. Spellcraft, of course, was cross-classed throughout (ending at level 33 with 18 ranks, summing to 20, and thereby +4 v Spells, to sit alongside the +2 v Spells from being a Hin) and Tumble met its natural end at level 37 (40 taken ranks - +8AC), while UMD reared to a defiant halt at level 31, giving the (now clarified) 33 net ranks, enabling use of pretty well everything.<br/>\n<br/>\n I then had to think about what I wanted early on in the build, and what could wait. So my second tranche became Search, Disable Trap, and Open Lock - 2 of which were done and dusted by level 3, leaving only Disable Trap to finish with a solitary point at level 19. My thinking was simple: while you might glide over triggered traps in later levels with barely a backward glance, early on they're likely to blow your head off, and that would be a Bad Thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n Which left Hide, Move Silently, Listen and Set Trap. I understand that at least 3 of these are intrinsic to the build, but I felt I had more scope to manipulate them than any of the others. As it transpired, Hide and Move Silently were a doddle, and went exactly where I wanted them to. Set Traps I'd always regarded as one of them fancy-arse things, but started to like the idea as I went along, so gave it the full charge at level 24. And that left Listen. A perfectly admirable skill - and one I prefer to Spot in the detection stakes (personal preferance). But this was the one I felt could be most used and abused in getting to its full 43 (48) ranks. Didn't have to do it much - the 30s is where it regains its place in the heirarchy, with a final plop of 5 ranks at level 40. But the point is, they'll have to be whispering long before that if my bat-like Hin ears ain't going to hear 'em.<br/>\n<br/>\n I know I'm preaching to the converted, but others may be looking in, and I know <em>I'd </em>like to know this stuff (unless I've made a bollocks of it, that is).<br/>\n<br/>\n Off to play, now, so <img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That would require 12 allocated instead of 5.<br/>\n<br/>\n 17 ranks in Disable Traps results in a final level of 21 with the synergy and INT mod (17 + 2syn + 2int), exactly enough to recover all deadlies except those lame gas types. To recover deadly gas, you'd need 5 more ranks, a total of 22 ranks allocated.\u00a0 Only 16 modified ranks are needed to disarm deadly gas, so at least they can be deactivated where they lie.<br/>\n<br/>\n So with the \"economy\" trap management package, you will save 12 skill points for other use.<br/>\n<br/>\n Don't forget about Take 20 when you try to figure what DCs you can handle.\u00a0 That means the Set Trap final ability (18) can set traps up to DC 38.\u00a0 Deadly gas DC is 45 for comparison reasons.\u00a0 Likewise, a Disable Trap final ability of 21 will result in a level of 41 with the Take 20.\u00a0 That's good enough to disarm all non-epic traps but since recovery costs 10 points, will only recover DC 31 which just so happens to handle all non-epic traps except the gas ones.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now for the kicker... Search.\u00a0 That's a dice roll... so no Take 20.<br/>\n<br/>\n To locate an epic trap requires a minimum of 23 modified ranks which will only spot the trap with a roll of 20 (5% chance every 6 secs).\u00a0 To spot epic traps immediately (i.e. any dice roll will succeed), you'd need to max Search at 43 minus INT mod, in this case, 41 ranks.<br/>\n<br/>\n So Search becomes absolutely the most crucial trap skill for an epic trapper.\u00a0 If you can't spot it, you can't do doodly squat about it, right?\u00a0 And rogues are the only class that can spot them anyway (though some custom environments may have altered the AD&amp;D ruleset to allow assassins the same priviledge) so it really pays to have a trap specialist in your party.\u00a0 Those epics can kill an entire party with a single trigger!<br/>\n<br/>\n My non-epic rogues try to keep Fox pots handy, especially before the skills have developed adequately.\u00a0 That +2 bonus can help spot, disable and recover DCs that would otherwise be just out of reach.\u00a0 Likewise with Cat pots with Locks and Set Trap.<br/>\n<br/>\n But this fellow is basically a kama monk with some roguish training so we will need to cross epic traps off his repertoire.\u00a0 Well, not completely.\u00a0 It just so happens that unless the spell has been altered by custom script, a scroll of Find Traps, a very inexpensive one, will locate and disarm even epic traps.\u00a0 So there is still hope, through UMD, of dealing with epic trap threats.\u00a0 But naturally, you would need to be either experienced in an area or clairvoyant to put that spell to use else it will cost a small fortune to be casting Find Traps around every corner (plus any non-epic traps will no longer be able to be recovered *all goes poof*).<br/>\n<br/>\n That's probably more information about traps than you would ever desire but at least it is one spot now (well, actually 2 spots counting <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://nwnecbguild.forumer.com/topic/2176824/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">my trap guide</a>).\u00a0 Now you have been officially notified.<img class=\"emoji-placeholder\" src=\"emoji/dummy.png\" /></div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

In non-PW environments (the OC and additions, Aielund and so on), the possibility of regaining the 20%/40%/whatever% of\u00a0 an xp penalty can really cripple a build, because you can't just rinse and repeat the kills (by which I mean such things as respawning mobs) until any deficit is regained. So yes, an xp penalty hurts more in SP. Otherwise Fighter would indeed most likely have been my preferred option - I'm not yet practised enough to know whether I'd have gained more from taking a different prestige classes - such as Harper Scout - but I do know that I like the bonus feats and saves that CoT delivers.<br/>\n<br/>\n In a way, this also speaks to the nature of the build - even the 13 levels of Rogue are only there to support the main thrust. She's a stealthy, dual-wielding monk who just happens to have some trapping skills - more to prevent her from being blown to pieces than laying minefields here, there and everywhere. And I suppose that's where I got a bit muxed ip with those trapping skills. That said, it's nice to know I can disable - and even recover - the lot. Even a Monk needs to eat, right? At least until very late levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n Oh, and sorry, the way wot I wrote it, it looks like Empty Body was my main goal, and it wasn't - Perfect Self at level 20 Monk was. Empty Body is simply a lovely gift to receive en route.<br/>\n<br/>\n I think (hope) I've edited the OP appropriately now.<br/>\n<br/>\n And as far consonants go: just be pleased I'm not Welsh, or there'd be at least six more \"L\"s involved (damn it, the druids will be after me again now).<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers!</div><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
