      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I like good rogue builds - and this one is good.<br/>\nStill I wonder why you want to take 5 levels of DD here. With 33 Rogue levels, your UD will almost be as good as the dwarven Defensive awareness.<br/>\nMy suggestion is to take CoT instead of DD.<br/>\nMore Fighter and CoT will give you more feats to play with, better saves, EWS and even the option to take saves boosting feats to cover the weaknesses of the build that you point at. But then again there are dozens of Rogue/Fighter/CoT builds out there already - for a good reason, I might add.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Hail Mick thanks for exploring this with me<br/>\nI wanted to explore a different approach to the fighter / rogue / DD combo (usually DD goes to 22 or 26)<br/>\nWhich was to make rogue ultra high<br/>\nI can look at fighter/rogue/cot builds again as you say they are a dime a dozen<br/>\nThey solve the save and feat problems of rogue<br/>\nFor rogue to go ultra high I will need two 'cheese' classes (low investment, high return)<br/>\nI thought why not look at some DD 5 cheese, see if that is going to be useful\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nDwarven defensive awareness II from DD 5 provides immunity to flanking, meaning no more flanking sneak attacks, and no more +2 AB bonuses for enemies who flank you<br/>\nIt was an interesting idea for a party who wants a 'big dwarven boy' to tank for them (heh who doesn't).\u00a0<br/>\nAnd if the enemy don't play along with the game he gets to stick the shortsword in pretty nastily :)<br/>\nIt comes at a cost, the Dodge and Toughness pre-requisites plus ITWF make the pre-epics ultracrowded\u00a0 -&gt; the main thing I don't like about the build<br/>\nYeah more fighter / CoT can solve that with the bonus feats and saves but then I feel GDL's already nailed a very solid rogue build with that combo<br/>\nI might leave this one to sit here for a while<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
