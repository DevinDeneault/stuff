Blackguard has to be evil, but CoT cannot be evil. Maybe it is just because I don't know how to take good advantage of the class, but I have never been impressed with Blackguard. The only evil character I ever played was a Rogue 7 / Fighter 8 / WM 25 with Dev Crit who cut through SoU, HotU and The Gods Themselves like a hot knife through butter.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

That's 6 less feats than what is listed here.\u00a0 Are you sure you are only allocating feats using the drop-down lists on the white cells?\u00a0 CBC should be warning you about all the illegal feats or just prohibiting the selection.\u00a0 You didn't accidentally Unprotect the Workbook, did you?<br/>\n<br/>\n Unless... there are a bunch of bonus feats your server gives to this sort of sequence.\u00a0 But you would be allocating all those duplicates even in that situation and still be prevented by CBC.<br/>\n<br/>\n Make sure that you always start out your CBC with a fresh (blank) spreadsheet and, when you save, always save using a unique name (never use the default name <em>CBC2002.xls</em> or whatever version you are using).\u00a0 I use a naming format like Ftr14_CoT10_BG16_hum.xls.\u00a0 You may need to add a numeral after the race if you want to keep more than one version of exactly the same class/race combo.\u00a0 If you lost your fresh CBC version by overwriting it with a build, delete your current CBC2002.xls (or whatever it was) and decompress a fresh one from the zipped file you downloaded.\u00a0 If you already deleted the zip, DL a new one from the Vault.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

She uses a cell background scheme and text colors as visual aids to indicate whether you are following the build rules or not.<br/>\n<br/>\n If you feel your changes have caused too much confusion, then start afresh.\u00a0 It's usually easier and faster overall that way than try to straighten out all the mistakes.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n One tip I'll pass on... focus only on your class sequence, ability increments and feats first.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n If a class abbreviation shows up red in column B, just ignore it for the time being.\u00a0 If it is red, check the Class prerequisites (columns BJ-BL at rows 46-50).\u00a0 Those will describe the BAB, feats and skills needed to satisfy the prestige class.\u00a0 Set up the feats first and watch the BAB column (N) for each row (level).\u00a0 When it reaches at least the BAB prereq, your prestige class can be taken on the next level or later.\u00a0 When the BAB and feats have been satisfied but there is still a skill prereq, scroll over to the skills section (columns EL thru FM) and type in the skill level needed at least one row (level) before where the prestige class is wanted (a white cell of that feat column).\u00a0 You may need to cross-class if none of the classes own it as a class skill so that would mean typing a number into one of the yellow cells. Only the grey cells are prohibited.\u00a0 When all prereqs have been satisfied, the red class abreviation will turn black.\u00a0 That means it is legal at that point in the build.<br/>\n<br/>\n After repeating this procedure for any other prestige class, finish up allocating all your feats for 1-40.\u00a0 If you need to swap around the class order to make the feats more optimized do it now.\u00a0 Delete any telltale (illegal) feats that show up by virtue of your juggling.\u00a0 These are always bonus feats because the general feats always show every 3 rows nomatter how much you swap around the class sequence.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n Once you are satisfied about the sequence and feat selection, return to the skill section and start laying out your skill schedule.\u00a0 If you wait until the last step to allocate skills, you won't need to redo them when you are still organizing your ideal class sequence and feats.\u00a0 It's just less work.\u00a0 If you are dumping skills, make sure your tumble classes appear on a level with a \"2\" or \"7\" in it, like 2, 7, 12, 17, 22 etc.\u00a0 For UMD, add 1 level to the tumble dump level for each 2 CHA below 10 to get the right dump level.\u00a0 For example, a normal dwarf (-2 CHA) would do a rogue dump at level 2+2 = \"4\", 7+2 = \"9\"... etc since the CHA is 4 points below 10.\u00a0 This will determine the ideal level to apply your tumble/UMD dumps.<br/>\n<br/>\n I hope this doesn't all confuse you.\u00a0 Use it for reference when the occasion arises.<br/>\n<br/>\n And stick with it.\u00a0 Eventually, it will become second nature.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
