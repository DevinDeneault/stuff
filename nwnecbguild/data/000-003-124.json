I recommend steering clear of this guy now.\u00a0 He's unstable thanks to some poor choices. He's still has orcish blood running through his veins and now, armed with two odd-looking blades, has only one instinct left... kill anything that comes within arm's reach.\u00a0 As the bloke would say if he were here:\u00a0 \"Blud is gud!\"\u00a0 And so it goes...<br/>\n<br/>\n Since there is no way for me to test this toon on a server (they all enforce AD&amp;D rules), I've begun testing via trainer vs. my own designed encounters.\u00a0 Let's just say at this point, it's interesting.\u00a0 It's ridiculously easy to taunt a paralyzed adversary. <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/8.gif\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n For those of you missing the joke, this is my own personal editorial on how to best misuse an alignment manager.\u00a0 It gave me a chuckle after sweating my butt off today so I figured to share this combo that only now exists in the universe of build minutia and our minds.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Lost Me Armor (Brb17/Mnk15/CoT8)</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n Barbarian(17), Monk(15), Champion of Torm(8), Any non-lawful Half-Orc (...to start)<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 18 (34)<br/>\n DEX: 16<br/>\n CON: 12<br/>\n WIS: 8<br/>\n INT: 12<br/>\n CHA: 6<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Brb(1): Blind Fight<br/>\n 02: Mnk(1): *Alignment Change*<br/>\n 03: Brb(2): WF: Kama *Alignment Change*<br/>\n 04: Brb(3): STR+1 (19)<br/>\n 05: Brb(4)<br/>\n 06: Brb(5): Ambidexterity<br/>\n 07: Mnk(2): *Alignment Change*<br/>\n 08: Brb(6): STR+1 (20), *Alignment Change*<br/>\n 09: Brb(7): 2-Wpn Fighting<br/>\n 10: Brb(8)<br/>\n 11: Brb(9)<br/>\n 12: Mnk(3): STR+1 (21), Imp 2-Wpn Fighting *Alignment Change*<br/>\n 13: Brb(10): *Alignment Change*<br/>\n 14: Brb(11)<br/>\n 15: Brb(12): Imp Crit: Kama<br/>\n 16: Brb(13): STR+1 (22)<br/>\n 17: Mnk(4): *Alignment Change*<br/>\n 18: Brb(14): SkF: Taunt *Alignment Change*<br/>\n 19: CoT(1)<br/>\n 20: CoT(2): STR+1 (23), Dodge<br/>\n 21: Mnk(5): Grt STR (24) *Alignment Change*<br/>\n 22: Mnk(6)<br/>\n 23: CoT(3)<br/>\n 24: CoT(4): STR+1 (25), Grt STR (26), EWF: Kama<br/>\n 25: CoT(5)<br/>\n 26: CoT(6): Armor Skin<br/>\n 27: CoT(7): Grt STR (27)<br/>\n 28: CoT(8): STR+1 (28), Epic Prowess<br/>\n 29: Mnk(7)<br/>\n 30: Mnk(8): Grt STR (29)<br/>\n 31: Mnk(9)<br/>\n 32: Mnk(10): STR+1 (30)<br/>\n 33: Mnk(11): Grt STR (31)<br/>\n 34: Mnk(12)<br/>\n 35: Mnk(13)<br/>\n 36: Mnk(14): STR+1 (32), Grt STR (33)<br/>\n 37: Mnk(15)<br/>\n 38: Brb(15): *Alignment Change*<br/>\n 39: Brb(16): Terrifying Rage<br/>\n 40: Brb(17): STR+1 (34)<br/>\n<br/>\n HP: 444<br/>\n Saves F/W/R: 31/21/28 (34/24/31 v spells)<br/>\n Add'l saves: Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +4<br/>\n BAB: 29<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 45 (melee, kama), 33 (ranged, any)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 26/30 +1 Dodge (last attacker)<br/>\n Alignment Changes: --------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;<strong> <span style=\"font-size:120%;line-height:normal\">10 <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/13.gif\"/></span></strong><br/>\n<br/>\n Skills: 199\u00a0 - Discipline 43(55), Heal 2(1), Intimidate 43(41), Spellcraft 14(15), Taunt 43(44), Tumble 40(43)<br/>\n<br/>\n Fun facts with mundane gear:<br/>\n<br/>\n DW APR: +43/+40/+37/+34/+31/+28/+43/+40\u00a0 (add 6AB w/successful Taunt)<br/>\n DW APR w/FoB: +41/+38/+35/+32/+29/+26/+23/+41/+38 (add 6AB w/successful Taunt)<br/>\n<br/>\n DW APR, raging: +45/+42/+39/+36/+33/+30/+45/+42\u00a0 (add 6 w/successful Taunt)<br/>\n DW APR w/FoB, raging: +43/+40/+37/+34/+31/+28/+25/+43/+40 (add 6 w/successful Taunt)<br/>\n<br/>\n Damage: 13-18 (26-36 on crit 19-20), max dmg/round: 208-288, max w/FoB 234-324<br/>\n Damage, raging: 15-20 (30-40 on crit 19-20)\u00a0 max dmg/round 240-320, max w/FoB 270-360<br/>\n<br/>\n Move Speed: +145% (no, barb &amp; monk speed don't stack)<br/>\n DR: 3/-<br/>\n SR: 25<br/>\n Uncanny Dodge (to help protect the +3 DEX AC)</div>"

I've often dreamed the concept of a bardic monk and woke up cursing the realities of the game's alignment mechanics.\u00a0 But what can we do?\u00a0 Either play Dungeons and Dragons as designed or look for a game that only resembles it with rules more suited to our presonal bias.</div></div>"
