A repository of knowledge and wisdom about all that is NWN character builds. Courtesy of The_Krit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Epic Character Search Engine: </strong>the search engine of the old ECB guild builds' database. Courtesy or The_Krit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Epic Character Builders Guild downloadable archive</strong> on the Vault courtesy of The_Krit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Pre-epic Character Builds Guild downloadable archive</strong> on the Vault courtesy of The_Krit.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Neverwinter Grimoire: </strong>This document is a compilation of the Neverwinter Nights, SoU, &amp; HotU rules. It covers most of the rules on character creation and has descriptions of every feat, skill, and spell that is included in the game. It is meant for the beginner and advanced player as a guide and reference. This is the second version of this document. Many things have been added and corrected along with Shifter info. This document uses hyper-linked bookmarks throughout. It is formatted to print front/back. The use of color in the document is meant for ease of reading and will not take up too much color ink. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Epic Character Table: </strong>This table shows when each class and Prc recives bounus feats as well as special abilities. It also shows the pre-requesits if the pointer hovers over a class.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Kamiryn's Character Build Calculator:</strong> The CharacterBuildCalculator is an Excel Sheet that allows you to create builds very fast and easily. You just select your race, your class (or classes) and the order of leveling. Then the CBC calculates at which level you gain a feat (regular/bonus) and what class feats you get. Also the CBC calculates your hitpoints, your BAB, your attacks/round, your saving throws, skill points, spell casting, bard song and many more things. Finally the CBC generates a text output of your build ready to post everywhere you like. The CBC covers races (feats, skill points, ability modifiers), hitpoints (constitution bonus, toughness, epic toughness), BAB, attacks/round, feats (regular, bonus, class, feat prequisites), saving throws (CON/DEX/WIS modifiers, feats), skill point selection (forbidden skills, cross-class skills, class skills) bonus skill points (human, INT modifier).<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit by Mick Dagger: <strong>For updated links, see the post by Hip Redux below</strong></div>"

      "content": "<div><strong>The Halls of Advanced Training Deluxe - HotU+SoU Edition:</strong> the ultimate character creation and customization module. You may create a character, make him/her any level you so choose and equip that character with any gear you wish from all the standard items in the standard NWN game and the HotU + SoU expansions plus many more custom items. There is also a pawn shop that collects copies of unique custom items from the inventories entering players. You may also change your alignment to any that you choose and tweak your ability scores. This is all done in a fully fleshed out setting with NPC's and navigational aids. There is also a large PvP Arena and a script powered level + gear balanced monster arena with customizable difficulty via adjustments to average party level and total party level. In addition there is a rogue training house to test your rogue's lock picking and trap skills and a testing hall to benchmark your character's battle capabilities with combat dummies and archery targets.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Novice to Epic Character Maker CEP23 Edition by DawnWalker: </strong>another module useful to level up a character to the desired level, equip him with vanilla and custom gear and test him in a handful of arenas against different enemy types of various levels. Direct access with customized characters to the OCs via a special portal in the module.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit by Mick Dagger: <strong>For updated links, see the post by Hip Redux below</strong></div>"
