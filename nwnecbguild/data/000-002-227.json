Hence, it's as comprehensive as you are going to get. You can even merge the NWN2 builds using the ancillary project dedicated for that game if you are so disposed.<br/>\n<br/>\n Besides, TK always has several oars in the water at one time with all his NWN connections so who knows when/if a new host is even in the offing.<br/>\n<br/>\n I am still trying to compile a dynamic engine that would combine all that legacy stuff and the builds posted here, but don't hold your breath because I'm attempting it solo.\u00a0 It's on my wish list, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n Hip by any other name is still, unfortunately...

It is friggin' HUGE!\u00a0 But all that had been loaded by contributors to IGN is all there.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nFinding an archive\u00a0 What a researcher needs to find what is desired is two elements: 1) category of the project and 2) a legacy ID number.\u00a0 In the case of locating the NWN1 ECB database I got lucky since TK's reference link in the NWN2 project contained that info.\u00a0 Otherwise, one needs to sample randomly every FTP folder to see if it is the one they want, hoping it s reflected as the category they recall.\u00a0 There are no titles in the FTP folder entries except for the category names so it can get tedious trying to locate just the one project you want without an ID &amp; category handy.<br/>\n<br/>\n The comprehensive FTP organization for NWN1 is located <strong><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"ftp://neverwintervault.org/rolovault/projects/nwn1/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here.</a></strong><br/>\n (Navigating up one level will display the folder for NWN2 projects if you want access to those.)<br/>\n<br/>\n AFAIK the compilation is pure public because I've DL'd files without logging into the vault site.\u00a0 That means anyone can FTP what they want without an account, but if a user wants to create a new project containing a missing resource from those DLs, an account is necessary.\u00a0 In my case, someone who remembered me from somewhere in the NWN community emailed me to create the project for him since he couldn't gain an account (not sure why??).<br/>\n<br/>\n In this case, we can now all have our own local copy of the search engine and builds.\u00a0 However, until it gets hosted again, ECB contributors (or anyone else, for that matter) won't be able to link to them as references plus all existing references we've typed into our builds are dead end URLs.\u00a0 I guess that means the ECB will need to adopt a new referencing convention if we want to cite previous builds.\u00a0 I suggest furnishing a class combo, build title and author. That should be enough for anyone with a locally-loaded ECB archive to find it. An extra step, but what are we going to do as dinosaurs in a techno world? <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/10.gif\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div></div>"
