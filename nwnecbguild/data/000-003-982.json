I've never played a bard before, I'm thinking they could be a nifty spellsword type of build. <br/>\n<br/>\nAerilith only goes to level 30, dev crit is disabled, and RDD is restricted. I believe half elf gets dodge for free.</div>"

I think paladin would only add a few points to saves at 16 charisma. I like the idea of indispellability , every time my battle cleric steps into a room the mob immediately goes for the dispel and i'm left having to cast darkness and go in with only half buffs. Would you dip the first 3 fighter levels early so you can wear full plate while leveling or is it better to save it for later for epic bonus feats. From reading the guide I know you want high taunt and perform, but like I said i've never tried a bard before so I'm unsure what leveling progression to use.\u00a0</div>"

I don't know if you remember your \"Strongest bard in the West\" and my \"Strongest bard in the east\"?<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for tweaks for this build, Lingering is possible. IKD is perhaps the one feat\u00a0that can go. Another tweak is to remove Lasting Impression and replace it with epic skill focus perform. That will give you a lvl 20 song (a lvl 21 song with buffs) and some better effects on skills from the songs.<br/>\nHere you also want to take into consideration how high\u00a0perform bonus you can get on various items.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut Lasting Impression and IKD\u00a0are my first choices.</div>",
