The Bard levels are for skill dumps. It looks to me that even though Devastating Critical is no longer instant death, the +1 to critical multiplier still makes it worthwhile. With all the requirements for WM and for Dev Crit, it would be hard to also include the dual-wielding feats, so your greatsword idea would be the way to go. I would go with sword and board, but that doesn't seem to fit the ring wraiths. How does that build idea sound to you?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe easier thing for me to do would be to make the build for you, but you would benefit more if I help you make the build yourself. It is your choice.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Since you mentioned Barbarian and Palemasters...<br/>\n<br/>\nhere's a build that I have had a lot of fun playing from the \u00a0Dwarflord...<br/>\n-------------------------------------<br/>\nIn the time of the Great Expasnsion, during the years of the Empire's Conquest of the Mountain Tribes, there was one who rose among that fierce folk to lead his people against the \"civilized\" soldiers of the Empire. Fell and filled with wrath, he became a Chieftain among the tribes, and grew into a symbol of defiance of the Empire's conquest. And everywhere he went, always there was a great Raven who flew above him. And it was said among the tribes that the Raven was a god of Old, and that he protected the Chieftain from death, for the great bird could see it from aloft.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSuffering one embarrassing defeat after another, the Emperor became mad with a desire to find this Barbarian Lord of the mountains who made a mockery of the greatest Army in Faerun. He eluded capture, won victory after victory, and soon grew into a legend among the Northern peoples.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nBut he fought one battle too many.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe eventually was captured. But rather than kill him outright, they wanted to break the spirit of the Tribes by making an example of their greatest warrior, their greatest symbol. He was beaten, tortured, and crucified upon a hilltop sacred to the Mountain Folk. Daily, vultures picked at his still living flesh. But a Raven came among them, and said, \"Take of this his flesh, his arm, but I ask you to leave his heart, for he will need it that he may have revenge.\" And so he endured the elements, and starvation, and dehydration, and at the end of each day the Emperor would come to his shattered and gangrenous form and would ask him to surrender, and each time the barbarian would lift his head up slightly and spit frothy blood in defiance.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nBut a day came when he no longer lifted his head. And it was in this hour that the Empire's legions had found a way to conquer the Mountain peoples, and subjugate them to their rule. And the once-proud Chieftain was cut down from the crucifix and cast into a shallow grave, forgotten, and left to rot.<br/>\n<br/>\nI know this because I was there, that day. It was I, a simple gravedigger, who dug his grave, I who was commanded by the watch commander to cut him down, and I who cast his body into the earth. And after the soldiers left I remained, for I was weary from my labours, and so I sat upon a small outcrop of rock that slowly sank into shadow beneath the mountains of the setting sun. I looked on the meager grave, without stone or tribal totem, and I pitied this once great man so filled with life. And as twilight creeped over the land, I saw a strange thing happen. I saw a bird, a great thing of ebon, circle above the grave, and then land without a sound upon it. It began to busy itself with pecking and scratching the earth. I picked up a rock to cast at it, for I felt this noble man at least deserved some dignity in his death, but something stayed my hand. For in that instant it perceived me, and I it, and I knew this was no ordinary carrion, but that raven I had heard mentioned in the mountain tales. And as I watched, enthralled by this strange creature, a sleep stole over me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe hoarse sound of cawing and the morning sun awoke me, and it occurred to me that I had fallen asleep and had dreamt it all. I looked to the source of the cawing, and there upon the grave were hundreds of ravens, all black as night and blanketing the earth with their feathered forms. And then, almost as if they preceived me, they flew aloft, like some dark stygian cloud, and flew beyond the mountains until they were out of sight. I scrambled to the grave sight, and there I found the most peculiar thing of all. The dirt and rocks had been moved, and there was naught but an empty hole. Naught but a single black feather, as long as my forearm and just as broad.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it was in the coming years that a new force moved among the mountain peoples, and a Raven was ever seen flying above the visage of a new, mysterious leader, shrouded in cloaks, and whose left arm and hand was bundled in a black cloth.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it seemed that the mountains themselves spewed the hordes of barbarians who came thundering across the plains, who set siege to the capitol, and threw down its gates, and set the city and its people ablaze, such was their wrath.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>For PvM, playable from 1-40</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>The Revenant</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Barbarian19/Wizard5/Palemaster16</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Benefits:</strong><br/>\nGreater Rage: +6 Strength/+6 Constitution/+3 Will Saves<br/>\nImmune to Sneak Attacks and Criticals<br/>\nExcellent Hit Points for a Spellsword<br/>\nTremendous Melee Advantage with Stilled/Extended Buff Spells<br/>\nGreat Skill Set (including Taunt, Spellcraft, Hide, Move Silently)<br/>\nTerrifying Rage with an unmodified DC of 52<br/>\nHigh AC<br/>\nImproved Invis 9x/day (4 Stilled)<br/>\nDR 3/- and Fire Resistance 10/-<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Weaknesses</strong><br/>\nLow Will/Reflex Saves: remember, Clarity is your friend.

I've enjoyed him so much I couldn't help but share. This is designed for a non-dev crit environment.

He wouldn't be much of a caster, either, with as many spells per day as a level 25 Wizard (10 from Wizard and 15 from every other level of PM), but the strength and duration of the spells would come only from his 10 levels of Wizard.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith my proposed build, I could change it to Fighter 22 / Bard 6 / PM 12 to gain 1 more AC (2 more AC anywhere else). If you now want a caster, there is still the idea for a Cleric 24 / Bard 6 / PM 10.

Clerics get all those \"spells\" and more, better ones, and more times per day. Even the Dark Blessing is done better by the Paladin version because Paladins don't get a penalty to their saves when the CHA modifier is negative, but Blackguards do.
