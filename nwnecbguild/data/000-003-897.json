      "content": "<div>1) PvM or PvP - A little of both please<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Level cap - 20<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Race preference - Human, Gnome, or Halfling<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Class preference - Sorceror mainly because I want them to be a fount of magic but I do not mind multi-dipping for more power.<br/>\n<br/>\n5) Melee preference - None, any option is viable.<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Range preference - None, any option is viable.<br/>\n<br/>\n7) Weapon preference - Staff but if another cooler option is suggested I would lunge at it.<br/>\n<br/>\n8) Maximum item enhancement - +4/+5 AC/Attack +1/+2 stats<br/>\n<br/>\n9) Spellcasting - I'd like to be a blasting cannon build that's pretty sturdy.<br/>\n<br/>\n10) Custom factors - Here are the spell changes for the server:<br/>\n<br/>\nBall Lightning<br/>\nChanged to operate like the Firebrand spell but cannot be targeted to the ground.<br/>\n<br/>\nBigby's Crushing Hand: Grapple check adapted to allow for a fairer opposed DC. Formula: Attack will now hit on natural 20, and miss on natural 1.<br/>\nCaster: d20 + Caster Mod (Int,Cha) + Caster Level / 2 (4 vs PCs) + 12 (Hand Str) - 1 (Hand Size Mod) + Spell focus feat bonuses<br/>\nTarget: AC<br/>\nGrapple Check: Caster: d20 + Caster Level (div 2 vs PCs) + 12 (Hand Str) + 4 (Hand Size Mod)<br/>\nTarget: d20 + BAB + Strenth Mod + Size Mod<br/>\n<br/>\nBigby's Grasping Hand: Attack will now hit on natural 20, and miss on natural 1<br/>\nCaster: d20 + Caster Mod (Int,Cha) + Caster Level / 2 (4 vs Pcs) + 10 (Hand Str) - 1 (Hand Size Mod)<br/>\nTarget: AC<br/>\nGrapple Check: Caster: d20 + Caster Level (div 2 vs PCs) + 10 (Hand Str) + 4 (Hand Size Mod)<br/>\nTarget: d20 + BAB + Strenth Mod + Size Mod<br/>\n<br/>\nHaste\u00a0- Only grants +1 AC (Mass Haste is unaffected.)<br/>\n<br/>\nImproved Invisibility<br/>\n<br/>\nGrants 25% concealment instead of 50%<br/>\n<br/>\nMass Charm:\u00a0Now functions like Charm Monster (works on all creatures).<br/>\n<br/>\nMagic Circle Against Alignment<br/>\nGrants +4 to Will saves, immunity to Charm and Dominate (per SRD)<br/>\n<br/>\nMestil's Acid Sheath<br/>\nDamage capped to 20 + 1d6. This would make it inferior to Elemental Shield but it reaches that cap at casterlevel 10, and so is useful to mid-level and multiclassed casters.<br/>\n<br/>\nMordenkainen's Sword<br/>\nSummons a sword construct rather than a Helmed Horror. The sword has a high AB but only one attack per round, immune to slashing/piercing/bludgeoning damage (per SRD spell Mage's Sword). Greater hitpoints if the caster has Spell Focus: Transmutation.<br/>\n<br/>\nPremonition<br/>\nDamage Reduction of 30/+6 at level 20.<br/>\n<br/>\nPower Word, Kill<br/>\nAs normal NWN but also does a flat 100 magical damage when creature is above the 100 hitpoint threshold.<br/>\n<br/>\nProtection from Alignment<br/>\nGrants +4 to Will saves, immunity to Charm and Dominate (per SRD)<br/>\n<br/>\nTime Stop<br/>\nThis spell has been modified so that it does not stop the whole server when used. The duration has been lengthened and targets are invulnerable for the duration to match PnP rules. Also a VFX is placed at the caster's location to help gauge the duration; it fades 3 seconds before the spell (per the SRD).<br/>\n<br/>\nTenser's Transformation<br/>\nNo polymorph; increases caster's STR, AB, attacks per round, sets them to 100% spell failure while active.<br/>\n<br/>\nWall of Fire:\u00a0changed damage to 2d6 + (CL/3)d6, max 8d6</div>"
