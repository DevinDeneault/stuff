As with the hijacking of the Aielund Thread, I do not not propose to make a walkthrough - such things may be found elsewhere, on other fora.<br/>\n<br/>\n Aribeth's Redemption is a 3-part module (available from the NwN Vault) that takes your character directly from the end of the Original Campaign back into the city of Neverwinter. It is only a viable set of modules if: i) you didn't kill Aribeth during the OC, ii) you are a good-aligned character (ideally LG. NG is fine, and CG can get away with it) of elven, human, or half-elf races, and iii) male (hey, them's the rules). Someone told me recently that this has changed as far as races are concerned, but I have no evidence to support that, sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n In essence, it is a pursuit of your character's romance with Aribeth hinted at in her cell (assuming the 3 points above) before you enter the Source Stone. You arrive back in Neverwinter after your defeat of Morag, to learn that Aribeth is to be put on trial - following some clearing up of what remains of the bad dudes.<br/>\n<br/>\n Assuming all goes well at the trial, Aribeth will have to perform 3 tasks to bring her back to the church's favour, and 5 to that of the Lords' Alliance. If you don't want to end this immediately, you'll probably want to go into exile with her.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>[I might as well ask my question now. When Aribeth is finally reconciled with the church (end of part 2/start of part 3), you get to choose which church she will join. Her choices are to become a priest of Helm, an Ilmateri monk, a champion of Torm, or a paladin of Tyr once again. I have only played this through twice, and have reinstated her in Tyr's grace both times, but I wonder what the results are should a different path be chosen. Does anyone know?]</em><br/>\n<br/>\n The mods are fairly linear (very much so in the first 2) and very wordy - lots of theological/moral/ethical debates with few options to stray from a single response. The third - and by far the biggest module - does give more leeway, but is still somewhat frustrating in its directional qualities. Nevertheless, the story is strong and logical in its movement, and the combat improves greatly as you progress. It also combines combat with other challenges very well, and I have no hesitancy in commending it to those who felt the OC left several stones unturned.<br/>\n<br/>\n An unexpected bonus awaits for those who have played Baldur's Gate, and particularly Baldur's Gate II through to the end, as well as those wondering about what happened to some \"lesser\" characters in the OC. The creator's attention to detail (sorry, forgotten his name) is marvellous here.<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyway, there's your starter for ten. Hope this helps make it a worthwhile topic. <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/11.gif\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n<em><strong>EDIT:</strong></em> Apologies, meant to let you know a few more details, but was distracted by a phone-moron. You should start this at level 17/18 (fairly obviously) and finish the whole shebang at around level 28 (essentially, much as if you'd played SoU and HotU), thus allowing a nice progression into, for example, Sands of Fate. You also carry your equipment forward from the OC, and there are several times it becomes upgradeable, as well as various stores. Iirc, max enhancement is +12, so we're looking at high magic here. It is also a Dev Crit viable environment, fyi.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>edit:\u00a0 20170219 per Hip; added Vault links to lead</em></div>",

      "content": "<div>Oh, bloody hell, where's Empyre when I need him?<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm not sure how much help this will be, but I'll try...<br/>\n<br/>\n First off, while I've heard the name Kevorkian, I can only assume it's the mercy-killing doctor we're referencing here (I'm in trouble if not), and no, that won't work with these mods. You need Aribeth with you. Quite apart from anything else, the quests you undertake are hers, not yours (except for one or two which are either not counted for early xp, or are undertaken while she is re-training in whichever churchly area you consign her - and these only go towards subsequent quests when the two of you are together again) - after all, you have no \"need\" for redemption, having saved everyone from lizardly death already. It's all about standing with your gal through thick and thin. She will receive 2 vials after her trial, and each quest undertaken will have them filled - a third at a time for the quests for the church and a fifth for each of the Alliance's. It may be worth noting that while you'll complete the religious quests by the end of the 2nd mod, you'll still have 4 to do for the Lords' Alliance in part 3.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thus, not a chance of the module working if Aribeth's already dead, however well-intentioned or merited it may have been.<br/>\n<br/>\n You're right, Hip, it is for storyline consistency, but at a more fundamental level than you may have thought.<br/>\n<br/>\n Hope this clarifies a bit!<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> A couple of things have just crossed my mind, though to be honest they scooted by pretty fast, so I might not recall both fully. If, rather than in my initial assumption, you were thinking that Aribeth could merely be found - much as encased within ice in HotU - I'm afraid I don't know: others might. The other thing is something of an oddity, given my earlier praise for continuity. An assumption is made that your character travelled with Sharwyn (the bard) during the OC. Don't be unduly worried though, there are reasons behind this, and it won't impact on the story.</div>",

I suspect, unless you have astronomic Persuade skills, it will hinge on whether you kept her ring from Port Llast, so if you weren't given that, death may well be the only option.<br/>\n<br/>\n My question about which church you choose for Aribeth was purely for information. I seem to have taken the coward's way so far: simply going with what I know. And I happen to be at that point in this, my third, run-through at the moment (using a Dev Crit version of my Aielund Sword Champion). It might be interesting to see how she behaves as an Ilmateri Monk (no sado-masochism jokes here, please), or a straight-up Cleric of Helm. It would seem a little redundant to play her as CoT, given that it's my main class in this build. Guess I'll just have to see.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks for the sage words, Empyre.

At least it places the PC and Aribeth within essentially the same frame of reference (\"birds-of-a-feather\").\u00a0 Whether or not the designer takes advantage of that or not... well... that's an experience TBD.\u00a0 I realize the series has some bridging value but that is not my intent.\u00a0 Simply a desire to sample some new SP (well, new to me, anyway).<br/>\n<br/>\n@Stagmeister:\u00a0 Except for trying to run the OC within 2002 limitations (am currently finishing up Ch2 with a wiz/rog and the added challenge is quite noticeable), I have zero interest in repeating yet another v1.69 session through it.\u00a0 My fun time is a precious commodity that I cannot afford to treat frivolously.\u00a0\u00a0 The other factor you may not have considered is that building a toon for the Redemption series from a 2002 format will seriously nerf the post-Level 17-18 character, with the feat/class limitations being the most influential (skills can always be dumped during Redemption, I suppose).\u00a0 <br/>\n<br/>\nOur LAN group used the OC as a launching point for our electronic venture away from PnP in 2005 just because it was easy and vanilla so we must have played through it 50 times or more, sometimes with some added bell-and-whistles provided by our tech-savvy scripters in the group and as DM'd sessions with different teams and party mixtures.\u00a0 <br/>\n<br/>\nPlaying through content that has been thoroughly-memorized has no appeal (to which I am sure you can relate to).\u00a0 Only the DM sessions kept it viable but those days are gone and we've migrated to content that reflects AD&amp;D 3.5 since that is the version our PnP group indulges.\u00a0 It's the flexibility of NWN's toolset and NWScript that allows the designer team to adapt NWN perfectly to a NWN2 style without needing to muck about with their inconvenient Electron toolset. <br/>\n<br/>\n...and thats's all there is to <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">that</span> backstory.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Okay, as the instigator of all this malarkey, I thought I'd take Empyre's advice and see what happened when I loaded a character who hadn't let Aibeth live. In fact, I took it one stage further and loaded a level 17 saved character from Aielund, who hadn't even heard of the elven betrayer, let alone spared her life of knocked her into Cania. Admittedly it was a he, and Good-aligned, but he loaded seamlessly into the first module (granted, he was invisible other than his helm and cloak, but that's down to the different gear available in Aielund). It made getting out of the chambers beneath Castle Never\u00a0 damned difficult, but when he did, there was Aribeth, sleeping like a babe, just as if the prescribed route had been followed. And I was recognised as a old friend to the city and its inhabitants - making me feel as if I'd simply taken a stiff blow to the head and would shake it off presently. Essentially, all was well.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thus, fretteth not. Neither ring nor romance are necessary to play the module.<br/>\n<br/>\n @HipRedux: A very fair point about the 2002 challenge, which I'd missed, sorry. Hopefully the news above will allow you to have a crack at the mod without too much pain. I still don't think Pally would necessarily be the best class (regardless of the author's stated preference) for your toon. At the end of the second mod/beginning of the third, you get to choose what Aribeth will become once reclaimed by the church - before that she's a single class fighter, so you've plenty of scope to come up with a character that she'll complement. And at different times you'll also have a Paladin of Sune as a companion for a while, and a half-dragon, and a dwarf member of the Order of the Radiant Heart, and a gnome (or halfling - can't remember atm) wizard, and a Drow thief/assassin, so the world's your lobster!<br/>\n<br/>\n Hope this helps <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/7.gif\"/></div>",

Thinking about it, it might be as well to give her stats should she return to Tyr's service as well, because you'll only have experienced her as a pure Fighter earlier on in the mods.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thus far, I've got the gen on her as an Ilmateri Monk - inheriting her at level 21. At that point, she's a straight level 21 monk (stats of STR 15, DEX 18, CON 11, WIS 18,INT 15, CHA 20 - enhanced by wedding band, much as your own is at that point). There are only 2 skill foci she has 0 points in - UMD and Concentration. Most of the rest are in single digits, but Discipline is in the teens, and Hide, Move Silently, Parry, Persuade and Listen are in the 20s. Her new/unexpected feats include (given that she was a full Fighter when the two of you began your attempt to redeem her): Called Shot, Disarm, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack and Toughness. These are alongside WF in Kama and Imp Crit in both Kama and Unarmed, together with Ambidexterity and 2-WFighting. She loses her bastard sword and armour, but these are replaced with Ilmateri Robes +7 (essentially the same as those yellow ones you get at monk creation - Order of the Deaf Rabbit or something) and 2 Ilmateri Kamas +5, which are both Holy Avengers and grant Haste.<br/>\n<br/>\n If anyone is choosing to play these mods, I hope this helps. I don't think it qualifies as a spoiler. I'll be back with the specs on Aribeth's other potential choices later...<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers</div>",

Have now done the dragons/Sisslik 2 - the sequel, and Aribeth was quite happy with fighting the bronze, silver and gold dragons, but no one else - and this time she did take damage. Also, while I'm now close to level 24, she remains at level 21. It's all very odd. I've been lucky so far, in that both Khurin and Thamaxyl (and even Sharwyn) have proved their worth big time, but I could do with a bride who isn't simply obsessed with taking selfies!<br/>\n<br/>\n Anyone, please!</div>",

She only levelled up when there were just the two of us, and she only gets stroppy with bad dudes when we're alone together - unless it's plot-necessary - so I'm wondering, is it just that she doesn't deal well with company? \"Oh, he's off playing with his new friends, I'll just sit over here and sulk.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n I'm probably wrong, but no one's come to my aid as yet, so I've had to come up with something on my lonesome...<img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/2.gif\"/></div>",

The only difference was that I kept Aribeth as a Paladin of Tyr, so maybe - for all that there are options - changing her to one of the other builds on offer is what led to her sulkiness. Perhaps there are only so many classes she could handle in one lifetime (\"Pally, Blackguard, Fighter - and now you want me to try something else?!\"). So my advice would be to stick with her as is/was. I only have empirical evidence, of course: it all could have been something else entirely.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

      "content": "<div>So I started playing these modules for the very first time ever (!) I first completed the OC with the character I use for the modules. And now I have played through the first two modules and just started the third where I have finished the dreams sequence. <br/>\nAfterwards I intend to play Sands of Fate.<br/>\nThe modules are straight forward linear with almost none dialogue options. The dialogues are very long and with an archaic language that I struggle to understand. If you read them during your first play through so you know what it's all about, \u00a0I think you can just skip them later by pressing 1 repeatedly. <br/>\nCombat is not too challenging with few exceptions. And your companion is able to handle things well, at least if you give her some basic equipment.<br/>\nThe quests work well with no bugs and are easy to follow. <br/>\nSome people are great fans of Aribeth and love playing the series for that reason. I am not one of them. I find her very annoying. She is an immature girl who sees everything in black and white: Good or evil, despair or hope, love or loathing and so on. She falls deeply in love with you, she claims. But she will not have an adult love relationship with you. <br/>\nAnd yes, I know that she has lost her dear Fenthick and feels betrayed. And I know that she has lived through a major crisis. But she is annoying nonetheless. <br/>\nI'll complete the series, the mods are OK despite Aribeth herself. And if nothing else I'll level up for SoF.</div>",

And there's a point during the desert quest when I would cheerfully have lopped off her head if it was an option. She really doesn't help herself with all the passionate dithering.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yes, she has had a rough ride: dead family, near freezing to death, plague, dead boyfriend, lizards, threat of execution, banishment (or Cania if she is summarily dismissed), and so on. But she does bring an awful lot of it on herself - set yourself up as a hero and prepare for a fall, she oozes hubris.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, that Paladin of Sune is a whole other matter...<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm glad you're going to finish the series, Mick. Unlike a lot of modules, the Redemption actually gets better as it progresses: the third part is far and away the best - and the least preachy (as well as being hugely longer than the other two combined).<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",
