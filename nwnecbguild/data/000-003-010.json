I'm not being lazy, but for reasons best known to itself, neither the Legacy Archive nor Hip's Fantabulous Contrapulator seems to be playing nicely with me at the moment, so I don't know if there's anything that works out there atm.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus I'm full of flu currently, so my brain isn't functioning even at its normal level of incompetence.<br/>\n<br/>\nThus...can any of you good folk come up with a Dwarven Defender with both EDR III and Devastating Crit that doesn't make it too underpowered to play?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

You take two levels of CoT at level 19 and 20, and I wondered whether the +1 bump to saves was the only reason (along with the bonus feat), rather than two more levels of DwD pre-epic and then either the CoT levels in epic for Epic Weapon Specialization? Is DwD one of those classes you can only take 10 levels in pre-epic? I'm sure I'm missing something, but I'm not sure what.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
