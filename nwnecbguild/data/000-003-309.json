Alternatively, you could max out your Spellcraft , which would be 21(23 with INT bonus) and get some more from equipment.<br/>\n Maybe put points in Concentration to resist being taunted.<br/>\n I don't know your server, so I don't know how useful are skills for crafting, Lore, Appraise, or Heal.<br/>\n<br/>\n Hopefully, others with more experience with Rangers and/or Assassins will come along with further feedback.</div>",

      "content": "<div>This build would be hard to level to 20, but I understand that this is not a concern. Make sure that you have all player sub-races covered as FEs and then the most likely shifted races like dragon and perhaps undead and outsider.<br/>\n If you want discipline 43, you have to take the last ranger level at 40. But I doubt that discipline is worth it here, since your main tactics will be attacking from stealth and your AC probably will be better than your discipline rank anyway.<br/>\n Normally I would have taken a level of SD for HIPS unless ranger or assassin are altered and get it at some point.<br/>\n This build is a bit half and half. Assassin is not optimized with only 19 levels and ranger is just enough for BoE. More ranger will give a better damage vs FEs. More assassin will secure a higher DA DC and more DA damage. You will need just 9 levels of assassin for the II spell-likeability. 13 levels of rogue will offer ED. But you will need more than 40 levels to qualify for them all: BoE, the II spell and ED (<em>Edit:</em> <em>unless you take SD10 rather than rogue 13 for ED</em>).</div>",

Why don't you try to replace one of the assassin levels for monk and dual wield Kamas for 10 attacks per round with <em>flurry of blows</em> active and hasted?

The crafting system is based on what they call a PP system and diffenert weapons can hold more enchants. Kama's are only allowed 2 PP, which would let me just but +6 enhancment. Whlie the Sai (the weapon in the dagger family but needs exotic weapon) holds 6 PP. With that many I can fit on each weapon, +6 enchanment,keen,1d6 ele damage.</div>"
