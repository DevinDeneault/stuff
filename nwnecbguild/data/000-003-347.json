This forum is well done and full of useful advice. <br/>\nI'm playing on a shard RPG pre epic level in Ravenloft. <br/>\nI'd like to play an archer. <br/>\nThe classes that I like are Ranger / Rogue / Fighter. It's possible to make a good build? <br/>\nSomeone help me? Preferably Human because the elves are not welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you so much!!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Just a few thoughts. Ravenloft is a lvl 1-20 PW with a lot of changes to feat distribution and even the skills and how they work. It is a RP server with a lot of vere-creatures and undead. I don't remember enough from the special rules to be able to come up with a build tailored to the PW. And I know that a normal build will not be optimal there. The environment is rather low magic and even an item with +1 attack bonus can be hard to find early on. When I played there, it was more for the roleplay (believe it or not).<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I should make an archer, I would try to build something with AA in it. I know you don't want to play as elf, but half elf has the human phenotype and you can rp being a 1/4 elf or something, trying to hide your lineage.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

There are a few magical weapons, and there are those that are hard to find. But it is not important. <br/>\nNot many changes were made to the talents, to allow everyone to play. <br/>\n<br/>\nHalf-Elf is ok.

Except for saves, but really.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've NEVER had problems with 4 pre-epic skill dumps. More than that is just being greedy, and TBH, I wouldn't waste any stat points on Charisma to cast bard spells at such a low caster level unless they are leftovers and I REALLY have nowhere else to put them. In this build Bard is just a \"tool\" for skill dumps and to give access to AA. Can you build it, please? Just so I don't have to.

Been a while, huh?<br/>\n<br/>\nNot at all a bad suggestion, it all depends on whether the OP will manage with fewer skill points and just 2 skill dumps. You know I'd be all for whatever increases the build's power. However, with just 2 Bard, you can't take Bard at level 1, which I guess is OK cuz then you don't have to worry about keeping CHA at 8.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
