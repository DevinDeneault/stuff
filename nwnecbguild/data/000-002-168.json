      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Hello!<br/>\nWe all know that Rangers must wear light- or no armor for their Dual-wield feat to work. So if you want a dual-wielder in heavy armor, you have to pick the TWF and Ambidexterity feats.<br/>\nBut what about ITWF? Will the ITWF feat that Rangers get at lvl 9 only work in light armor as well?<br/>\nI tested it in the \"Pretty good character creator\" module with this build:\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Ranger(9), Fighter(4), Human\nSTR: 15 (18)\nCON: 12\nINT: 12\n\n01: Ranger(1): Power Attack, Cleave, Favored Enemy, {\n02: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus: Shordsword<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong>Improved Two-Weapon Fighting</strong></details>\n\nI equipped the ranger with full plate and two shortswords and let it attack some combat dummies. It has BAB 13 and should have 3 attacks per round when fighting with one weapon. Two weapons should add a forth attack and ITWF should add a fifth attack.<br/>\nThe combat log showed 5 attacks per round. The AB was -2 compared with one hand attacks. There were 2 off hand attacks per round at the right AB. <br/>\nThis test showed that the ITWF feat you get from the Ranger class worked just like the normal ITWF feat even in heavy armor.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Congratulations!<br/>\n<br/>\nIt opens up many more possibilities for strength based dual wielding ranger builds, where large amounts of ranger levels are highly desirable for the favored enemies feats<br/>\n<br/>\nI read your post and tested it as well in the Pretty Good Character Creator and I wish to make it known I have confirmed Mick's observation.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst with a Fighter 1 / Ranger 9 build using the method of taking the TWF and Ambidexterity feats as a fighter, then leveling ranger to 9.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nBAB 10. Two shortswords wearing full plate. 4 attacks when it should be 3 if the ranger ITWF feat was restricted to light armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso with a Fighter 1 / Ranger 19 build. BAB 20. Two shortswords wearing full plate. 6 attacks when it should be 5 if the ranger ITWF feat was restricted to light armor.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt shows in the character sheet display, and the combat log as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span class=\"inline-attachment\">\n<dl class=\"fileimage display\">\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/201909/10759084_1518f60cc2b8d99cb4becca3f2df94e4_t.jpg\" />\n</dl>\n</span><span class=\"inline-attachment\">\n<dl class=\"fileimage display\">\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/201909/10759084_487433c1eed0b0697bf4c5853364dd08_t.jpg\" />\n</dl>\n</span><i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
