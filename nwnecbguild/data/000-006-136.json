      "content": "<div>This is a battle cleric with a 57 DC Stunning Fist (13 per day) when fully buffed. It is designed for low/medium magic PvM and PvP, the AB is too low for most high magic environments. Despite being a stunner it is built to use kamas since the unarmed damage is much lower than what kamas can provide. Think of it more as a battle cleric with a surprise rather than a normal monk.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis build can self-buff to the +20 AB cap when wielding a kama but it requires +5 AB gloves or a +5 AB sling to reach the AB cap with other weapons. The AB should be decent in most low/medium magic environments, however if +10 EB weapons or better are available then the AB will range from mediocre to terrible. AC, HP, and saves are all decent but not amazing, as a result this build is more suited to party play rather than soloing. Thanks to cleric spells and Stunning Fist it is a great asset to any party, both for PvM and PvP. Stunning Fist can be useful even in situations where IKD is not since a 57 DC Stunning Fist is harder to resist than a +61 AB knockdown attempt in most PvP environments.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a lot of room for customisation with this build. It is possible to increase both the AB and Stunning Fist DC by minmaxing, however I prefer balanced builds and so I haven't attempted to do so.<br/>\nThe level layout can be either Monk10/Cler24/Figh6 or Monk10/Cler26/Figh4, I chose the former since I wanted to reduce the number of Great Wisdom feats in the build. The pre-epic spread in this build is Monk8/Cler12, a pre-epic spread of Monk4/Cler16 makes levelling easier but in exchange the build loses 1 reflex.<br/>\nThe chosen domains are Trickery and War for Aura Of Vitality, Cat's Grace, and Improved Invisibility. Depending on your environment you might want to choose other domains such as Animal, Healing, Magic, Plant, Strength, or Travel.<br/>\nI chose to end on 20DEX/24WIS since it gives extra Cleric slots, increases Stunning Fist DC, and a -2 AB loss isn't a huge deal thanks to AB buffs. Ending on 22DEX/22WIS or 24DEX/20WIS are both valid choices that don't require changing the build much. If you want more skill points then drop CON to 12 and increase INT to 14. STR is purposefully kept at 6 so that Divine Power caps it at 18, unless Divine Power has been altered on your server I suggest keeping 6 STR.<br/>\nThis build has a lot of possible feat choices, I chose to focus on kamas and let AB buffs make up for not taking EWF: Unarmed. IC: Kama can be replaced with Craft Wand, Empower Spell, Maximize Spell, Toughness, or WF: Unarmed. Dropping EWS: Kama frees up two epic feats that can be used to get ESF: Concentration, EWF: Unarmed, or increase the Stunning Fist DC to 61. If a 57 DC is overkill for your environment then you can drop some ISF feats in order to pick up ESF: Concentration or EWS: Unarmed.<br/>\nThe 25 points in Listen are leftovers, they can be allocated elsewhere with no issues. I didn't invest in Discipline on this build, if you want Discipline then either lower Listen and Spellcraft or increase INT to 14.<br/>\n<br/>\n===<br/>\n<br/>\nClass: Monk 10 / Cleric 24 / Fighter

The elf has -1 AB and -2 CON but gains Keen Senses, whether that is a good trade or not depends on the environment. The human trades -1 AB and -2 WIS in exchange for an extra feat and skill, personally I prefer the higher AB and DC. Also Divine Power caps STR for halflings but not for elves or humans, so the other races can potentially get +2 STR as long as they buff STR after casting Divine Power. I chose halfling since I felt that it was the best race for the build, but both elf and human are good alternative choices.</div>"
