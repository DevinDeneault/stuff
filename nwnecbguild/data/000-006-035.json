      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">Heya Demos, back with an interesting build i see.<br/>\n<br/>\n It kind of looks like my \"shadow warrior\" build but you use monk/assassin instead of shadowdancer to achieve all those nice passive effects like \"improved evasion\" in your build. I like how it is not a kama build and i like it more because he is strength-based. At high levels when perma-haste might be available he will also get a nice speed bonus from monk as well, since haste effects are multiplied in their case. Overall a nice and enjoyable build due to wm criticals and monk speed both! If i was about to make a suggestion, that would only be for your fortitude save, that is kind of weak for a warrior, so i would replace improved expertise with epic fortitude in a heartbeat. Regular expetise will suffice with this build since he has full tumble and both wisdom and dexterity bonuses to his ac.<br/>\n<br/>\n Something else you could improve, although i am fairly sure you had your reason for this (perhaps the PW that you play in) is your skills. I would take all those points from heal and put it into UMD so that i could use any item or scroll. That's all and again kudos for an interesting build like this.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

It's the way that the effect is linked to others that determines the probability of dispel.\u00a0 That means a scroll of ImpInvis (7) will amount to just about the same results (...as an asn 9 feat version) and can be used as many times per day with UMD as the number of scrolls in inventory.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
