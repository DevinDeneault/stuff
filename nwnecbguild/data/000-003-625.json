      "content": "<div><strong><span style=\"font-size:150%;line-height:normal\">The Forger of Kingdoms</span></strong><br/>\n<br/>\nGone back to the drawing board to rebuild this build.<br/>\nMade this guy a two weapon master in the Warhammer (Bludgeoning) and Scythe (Slashing/Piercing) so he can cover all types of physical damage plus single handed/two handed combat when required.<br/>\nWith the huge AB boosts WMs get I could have put the base AB up to 50 but I've done such builds before (Professor of War 50, Mithdradates's The Executioner 53), and in PvM it felt like overkill in even in a challenging solo environment such as WoG, it made me wishing for other features.<br/>\nInstead I borrow one of Cinnabar Din's ideas (<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build247924.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stalwart Warrior</a>) and making him a dwarf, boost Cons, get EDR III. I don't go quite as extreme with the Con boosts but manage a similar Fort save in the process.<br/>\nMakes him a party favourite with 600+hp, evasion, fort save 30, he can receive all the punishment and dish out some of his own with EWS and +6-12 str damage with the warhammer (or +9-18 str damage with the scythe).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who have access to CEP Weapons (ie. WoG, other custom modules) I have put exotic in the build rather than improved knockdown, and changed the secondary weapon to Scythe or Mercurial Greatsword. This is mostly because in WoG there is a Mercurial Greatsword (slashing) called \"Forger of Kingdoms\" (I wanted him to be able to equip the weapon he was named after) which requires exotic weaponry, there are other benefits too. If this is not desirable, then exotic can be dropped, secondary weapon to halberd, and improved knockdown incorporated into the build.<br/>\n<br/>\nIts challenging searching for previous WM builds who choose two or more weapons. If I have missed any, please feel free to comment.<br/>\n<br/>\nKaliban99's\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build204002.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"

      "content": "<div>Hi!<br/>\nTo cover every kind of weapon can be a daunting task. You want three different damage types, one- and two handers and even dual-wielding.<br/>\nThat burns up a lot of feats, espacially when you also want to be a weapon master in all those weapons.<br/>\nYou are not going all out here, but even so, you suffer from the: \"If you want too much in, you make the build weaker\".<br/>\nSomething you also pointed out yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you can do is to reduce to two weapons, one with piercing/slashing damage like the scythe or the halberd and one blunt weapon like the heavy flail. If you want one-handers, scimitar is a great slashing weapon for a high threat range, and warhammer will take care of the blunt. Morningstar is also a blunt/piercing one hander to consider. For practical purposes a slashing and a blunt weapon will be enough to cover most situations.<br/>\nThe blunt weapon will mainly be for creatures that also are crit immune (undead etc.) and should only need WM for the AB boost.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to take the build idea in a completely different direction you can do like Empyre with his <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/universal-warrior-fighter-12-bard-8-rdd-20-t515526.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Universal Warrior</a> builds.<br/>\nOr you could make a Ranger Tank (with minor fighter and a slight touch of rogue) with high AB and damage from EWS, FE and bane.<br/>\nBut I know that is not what you explore now.</div>",
