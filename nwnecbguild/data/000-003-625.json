With trying to prove they aren't an animal. If you ask me, staying alive is what separates us from the dead and that's all that matters.<br/>\nSure, as a kid I never dreamed I'd end up alone against the world with nothing but my instinct to survive. But to be honest, as a kid I never really dreamed at all.\" - Balok Bloodstring<br/>\n<br/>\nThroughout Nordock's taverns there are whispers of a dark menace in the Great Northern Forest, not far from Tobaro. Some tell tales of spirits of vengeance. Some of Drow, bent on killing anything of fairer complexion. And while the truth is certainly a lot less entertaining, it doesn't make it any less deadly. Balok Bloodstring was born a bastard to a local working woman in a brothel,\u00a0his father dead before his first breath were he to listen to his mother. From the moment he could walk he was drawn to the outside, where he could be alone and answer to no one but himself. Not that he had much choice in the matter... Regardless, he grew up alone, exploring the dilapidated town on his own and avoiding the other children.<br/>\n<br/>\nSoon, he invented a game to see if he could pelt the kids with rocks and quickly hide away in some dark corner or behind a chimney if on the rooftops. At first he was merely caught and beaten senseless or chased into the woods where he'd sleep until dawn. Over time though, he began to understand the timing, the angles, the misdirection required to pull off such a feat. Before long there were tales of spirits menacing the townsfolk with rocks and rotten food.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt some age, perhaps 10, maybe 12, his birth mother died of some disease as it were. It then came as no surprise to Balok that he was suddenly without a home. He took to exploring the world around him according to his rules and at his own pace. He found that a bow and arrow suited him well and he wasn't half bad with it. In fact, the better his skill, the less chances he'd ever have to worry about sword, axes, and all those other rudimentary tools people liked to use. His talent grew with every year, as he picked off bandits, rich nobles, animals, or whatever caught his fancy that would keep food in his belly. He became skilled enough through sheer dedication and hard work, that most assumed he had to be an elf. Probably some murderous Drow. This story grew to be the dominant tale, so much so that elves and other do gooders began to seek him out and learn of who this mysterious elven rogue was. Many an adventurer died exploring into the woods hoping to either make conversation or end his life. Balok never took the time to ask which as. Whether they came in peace or they came with malintent, Balok was the one who walked away.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, adventurers slowly stopped looking for this mysterious figure, though there were always a few a year that hadn't gotten the memo. Still, any time Balok was in town he never missed a chance to hear tales of \"Bloodstring\" as the mysterious figure had come to be called. Sometimes Bloodstring was an undead elven archer with a divine bow seeking revenge on the living, other times he was the leader of a Drow regiment protecting some treasure, fortress, or who knows what. Whatever the case, nobody had ever laid eyes on Bloodstring, yet the thing they all seemed to be sure of was that he wasn't some scruffy human vagabond. That's for damned sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span class=\"inline-attachment\">\n<dl class=\"fileimage display\">\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/202004/10759266_c095b01b066176672d2516c98752c051_t.jpg\" />\n</dl>\n</span><br/>\nBalok Bloodstring<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my first attempt at a build, so I thought I would start off with something fairly straightforward that I am hoping can be played in most any setting with relative safety.<br/>\nI'm still play testing and hoping you guys can really help me make this build shine. End game viability is certainly something I am thinking this may struggle with, but I might find it's actually in leveling.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill, the basic premise is a ranged HiPS user which utilizes sneak attacks, traps, and his range to win at all cost with pride nor nobility weighing him down.<br/>\nPure survival no matter what it takes.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnimal companion I chose was a Hawk to bring home that he's basically on his own. A panther would also be neat for this with it's stealth abilities, but makes it feel more like a ranger than what is intended.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI enjoy the sneak attack aspect because I felt it matched thematically and takes advantage of the HiPS combat cycle, two arrows with 12d6 sneak a piece, twice a round if you're quick with the HiPS, seems to put out pretty decent damage. I am building this for leveling on a Mid Magic PW that caps at 40 with Nordock Module. This means+5 gear is generally abundant, and once you start doing lvl 40 dungeons you can start to get tokens for the +6 gear. After that there is very rare socketable drops where you can go beyond that, but vast majority of lvl 40 players have a mix of +5 and +6 gear from what I can tell.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuilds I used to help get to the point I'm at:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/gloom-razor-of-the-hin-rogue-24-divine-champion-10-t2355280.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gloom Razor of the Hin</a>\u00a0- by grizzled_dwarflord<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/viewtopic.php?p=762#p762\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Classic Archer</a>\u00a0- by Valerfor<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTitle: Balok Bloodstring - The Lone Wolf<br/>\nClass: Ranger 20 / SD 1 / Rogue 19<br/>\nModus Operandum: Get the job done.

If you are patient you can survive almost any fight aside from true sight users.

Wide range of skill points to use as you wish.<br/>\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 UMD for Dodge Boots +5, Scrolls, and Wands. This opens up options for gear on PW's.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Cons:</strong><br/>\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Saves, I think the first thing that might be worth focusing on for my build is raising the saves, unless I am not understanding how to calculate these properly?<br/>\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Without sneak attack let's face it, your damage isn't going to be great, but there are many ways to get Sneak Attack going through UMD use or if in a party.<br/>\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spells, you have none... Ranger was only really taken for the excellent AB up to 20 along with FE giving us some free AB towards very common enemy types (I chose the ones I happen to know I'll be hunting during those portions of lvling along with some of the end game dungeons.) That being said, this ends up being a very vanilla play style with the only real interactions being when to use hips, to use rapid fire or not, and whether you should shoot the arms or legs. That's sort of the point though.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>Combat Strategies: </strong>(I like the way grizzled_dwarflord did this part)<br/>\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When solo, use traps, take your time, make the enemy fight to your specifications. You gain more xp per minute alive than you do dead.<br/>\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sneak attack or don't attack. Balok couldn't care less about fighting fair or proving he can go toe to toe with anyone or anything.<br/>\n\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0UMD is invaluable and almost like a cheat button. Wands and Scrolls open up an immense number of options on how you want to play and nothing is off limits for Balok. Well except... yeah, <em>nothing</em>.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>Notes:</strong><br/>\nI look forward to actually leveling this character. I think the grind to 20 will be about as basic as it comes, but should mechanically be sound. Once it hits Lvl 21 for hips the safety goes up, but damage likely will just slowly build from then on every 2 levels of rogue. Would love to get some feedback or other suggestion on a ranged HiPS user.<br/>\nI did search the forums but didn't find anything too similar, but apologize if that is just my own lack of ability.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

By gaining 3 more levels of Ranger over Rogue, I'd be gaining 2d6 against only my favored enemies, but losing 2d6 sneak attack against any enemy, right? I can definitely see how that could be beneficial if I'm against my FE and can't sneak attack, but otherwise it seems situational as well.<br/>\nCan damage from bane of enemies crit? If so that's certainly better than sneak die, but seems like you could go either way and I think build would be fine.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

The 43 ranks in the build are exactly as effective as 40 ranks.<br/>\nOpen Lock - While I'm not familiar with the environment, I suspect that opening a DC 73 lock is overkill.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf another Ranger level were added late in the build, spare skill ranks could be invested in Discipline, a highly desirable skill.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

If that's the case I'll definitely take rogue level 1 to fix the stats. Str is in there for carry weight and to augment the damage from composite bows.
