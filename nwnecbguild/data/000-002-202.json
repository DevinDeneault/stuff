I started my build as a paladin and at second level I swapped to cleric. I added war and trickery as my domains but I am unable to add these domain to my hotbar. Any advice would really be appreciated. Thanks all.     Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

As one who doesn't do magic-users, does that make a big difference?<br/>\n<br/>\n Not terribly helpful, I know, I just wanted to extend a hand of greeting - someone who knows what they're talking about should be along soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n Cheers<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">The problem is I am not seeing Cleric powers even show up when I do this. If I start a fresh Cleric character the game defaults my domain powers into the hotbar cells. That said if I choose to move the powers to a different cell I am unable to do so as they do not show up in the radial menu. Is it possible my game is broken or am I just a little slow here?

Think I have a handle on the problem.
