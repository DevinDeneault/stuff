When blood cools, it tastes like a coppery mess. He was very hungry but that was because he waited too long. He brushed a small bit of flesh from his blackened armor, mildly annoyed that its luster had been compromised with the remains of the unworthy. Those still alive huddled in the corner, whimpering, eyes wide, jaws quivering in terror. Some clutched the dead to their breasts, silently wailing and rocking back and forth; some stared in catatonic terror at the blood and bone scattered over the floor.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe sighed and dropped the severed hand he had been holding. He wasn't sure who it had belonged to. In fact, the whole tired scene was becoming boring. He returned to his horse and pale, shaking squire.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"You were right lad, your family's inn was not to my liking. Let's push on shall we?\"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Infernal Warrior is evil. A shard of absolute blackness dwells in his soul and cannot be removed. There is nothing so horrific than a Paladin who has fallen from grace. As a character, they are dark army unto themselves. They bring dark magic and fighting skills that are truly terrifying as you know they will be used for the ruin of order and civilization.<br/>\n<br/>\nFighter(8), Paladin(3), Blackguard(29), Human,

Author</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nEquipment<br/>\nLongsword<br/>\nTower Shield<br/>\nFull Plate<br/>\n<br/>\nSpecial note from the author: The idea and a stellar example of an Infernal Warrior in history came from real-life ghoulish historical figure Gilles de Rais whose exploits are so heinous that they must be read to be believed. A devoted Catholic for all but the last portion of is life (where he attempted to sell his soul to Satan), he would be labeled a serial killer in this day and age.<br/>\n<br/>\nKey Advantages<br/>\nAgainst non-critical immune foes, the Infernal Warrior is deadly with a base damage of 1-8+10, +8 divine damage from Divine Might, and +13d6 Sneak Attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen fighting against Undead, the Infernal Warrior has a strong Turn Undead--an impressive 17 uses a day!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Infernal Warrior can strike fear (and more) into the forces of good 3 times a day, with Smite Good that gives +8 attack and +58 damage. Evil critters shouldn't get too comfortable either, since the Infernal Warrior also gets to Smite Evil 3 times a day, for +8 attack and +6 damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's not forget the Infernal Warrior's fall from grace has brought him an Epic Vrock to summon at will--a level 25 warrior with 28 AC, 375 HP, +32/27/22/17 Attack Bonus, 1-8+7 damage, and both Damage Resistance and Damage Reduction.<br/>\n<br/>\nDefensively, the Infernal Warrior is no slouch, with 520 HP and 27 AC wearing Full Plate and a Tower Shield, and 35 AC using Divine Shield.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Infernal Warrior isn't going to be walked over by casters either with a 47 Fortitude, 36 Reflex and 35 Will saves.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, the Infernal Warrior is balanced and effective against many different types of foes, whether he's fighting a jealous Necromancer's undead, or just having some fun laughing in the face of a stricken Paladin--which isn't to say he can't sweet talk when he needs a temporary ally or just wants to get by the gate of a city to plunder it.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
