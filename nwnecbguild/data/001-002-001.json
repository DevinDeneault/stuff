      "content": "<div><strong><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://worldofgreyhawk.fr.yuku.com/topic/3/Server-Location-Description-and-Required-Files\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">World of Greyhawk Server Location Description and Files</a></strong><br/>\n<br/>\nHail, fellow builders!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have waited long enough for Kail to string together a more complete guideline / advertisement for our server, but it seems I have been left with the task after all. Not a problem, really, I LOVE that server, it's just that I though Kail could give a more complete explanation of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWorld of Greyhawk, or WoG as it's known, is a server that is based on a PnP book, containing many great adventurers that the core fans of RPG have at some point in their lives played, such as the Temple of Elemental Evil. Besides that, it's a great module, with many balance fixes, a list of which can be found at the server entrance, very good and challenging dungeons and very present and coherent DMs, as well as a fixed playerbase that can help many new guys.<br/>\n<br/>\nPvP there is allowed, but in practice, not seen. people there prefer the co-operative style, and that has been made clear on many occasions, included when I myself suggested the addition of DM-administered tournaments for players to test themselves against one another. Farming is also frowned upon, and to some extent illegal, as you're not supposed to go to certain lower level areas unless you are of the appropriate level. ToEE (Temple of Elemental Evil, is an adventure for parties of 4 lvl 5 characters (with a maximum distance of 3 levels between each other, so you can't have a lvl 3, a lvl 5 and a lvl 8 toon in the same party, for example, because the lvl 3 guy would be out of the \"range\" of the lvl 8 toon) and it ends at around 12th-14th level. Soloing the place, you shouldn't be over level 20, maybe around 16 tops, as by then most monsters will give you very little XP.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many quests to be done there and areas to explore, and all quests that I have explored so far have been very well constructed and also hard to acheive. As an example, here are a few of them:<br/>\n<br/>\n- The Old Moathouse (lvls 1-5, you can do it up to lvl 8 or so)<br/>\n- The Kobold Lands (also low-level area)<br/>\n- The Isle of Ruskis (also low-level, but very very hard for lvl 1 toons)<br/>\n- The Temple of Elemental Evil - very long quest<br/>\n- The Cult of the Dragon - long quest, but it can be done in three digesteable parts<br/>\n- The Ghost Tower of Iverness<br/>\n- The Great Northern Crusade (exploring the shield lands) - very big quest<br/>\n- Defeating the Giants (Hill Giants, then Frost Giants, then Fire Giants) - also a big one<br/>\n- Rary, The Traitor - Excellent Epic quest, but also very very time-consuming<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd many many others. I won't spoil anything else, but there are many more quests or even places you can explore: Bandit Lands, Undermountain, The Underdark, Beyond the Underdark (you'll have to do it to know what lies within), Duergar Caves, Manscorpion lands, And even in these above quests, some have side quests that can be done while exploring the area, like White Plume Mountain and Castle Hart, when you're doing the Shield Lands, etc..<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also many balance and sometimes bug fixes that have been implemented on WoG. The main thing is that WoG has an improved AI system that makes mages cast the proper spells, so if you let them buff, you're probably either going to take a dirtnap or use up a host of Heal potions. This server is in general not designed for beginners, and even some more experienced players that don't build properly may have a very hard time surviving there. AC is of UTMOST importance, as monsters will have a competitive AB throughout. AB isn't AS important, but is also relevant in some cases. Monster HP and saves are competitive throughout, so no easy way to Finger of Death or Wail of the Banshee your enemies unless you attack the monsters' weak saves. Monsters will use Hide and Move Silently and KD and Taunt when applicable, they will also commonly heal themselves. Bosses are TOUGH AS NAILS, there are no easy ways to kill them, well, none that I can share anyway .<br/>\n<br/>\nMany spells have been altered in order to balance spellcasting a bit, so you may want to take a look at this list, but I won't list all of them, just the most important:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Harm and Heal are capped at 250 damage.<br/>\n- IGMS can hit a single target fewer times than the unmodified version (don't know the exact number)<br/>\n- Blade Thirst lasts Turns / Level instead of Rounds / Level<br/>\n- Darkfire and GMW can be cast on Arrows (giving them bonus damage), and GMW can be cast on Bows, adding the enhancement level and an equal amount as Mighty Property, so a lvl 15 GMW will add +5 to enhancement and +5 Mighty<br/>\n- Epic Summon spells have been significantly powered up, but since monsters have as well, they're still comparatively weak.<br/>\n- The regular Summon Creature spells have been redone. Now they last only 1 Round / level, but you can change the summoned creature type using a Book of Summons. That also applies to BGs and PMs Undead Summoning feats. Clerics of the Animal Domain and Druids have a summoned creature one level higher than normal, that is excellent, but what is different is that Summon Creature 9 will actually invoke a 10th level creature, which are the strongest summons in the game, except for Epic ones.<br/>\n- Divine Wrath duration has been altered to go up the more levels you take of CoT.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Magic level, I would call it a mid-magic world, with a +6 enhancement cap (but you can't really find any +6 weapons, unless you're really really lucky). KD immunity is common in bosses, and some of them even have critical hit immunity. One of the coolest aspects of WoG is that you can use what is known as DM buys. Once every 5 levels you can buy a magic item with a power level according to your level, so Weapon Masters aren't completely screwed! Permanent Haste is RARE, except for the Scimitar of speed, but at level 35 you can DM buy an item with that property (but just that and nothing else). Another important thing is that they have a varied set of custom items, so, for example, you can have a Cloak of Wisdom and use a Ring of Wisdom and some other item to cap wisdom, so you aren't restricted regarding slots. You don't mandatorily need to use a Periapt of Wisdom. That's nice because mainly natural AC can only be attained through that slot. Also, they have Bracers of Shielding, which allow you to dual-wield much more effectively, as you won't lose much AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nOverall, it's a HOME for me. I find that to be the most balanced world I have encountered in my online years. They really care about the game and enjoy playing it, and if you play there I hope you will come to agree with me. As for defects, there aren't many, but just so you don't call me byist, let me list a couple: Sometimes you will wait a very long time to get a DM buy, as the lead DM has a very busy RL, but now she has added a new DM to the staff, so things have improved. There is a Cleric / God alignment and Domain restriction system, so if you aren't of the correct alignment or have the correct domains for your god, you won't be able to lvl up as a cleric. Also, builds with conflicting alignments are illegal on WoG, so no Paladin BGs, or Monk Bards, or anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might edit this post later if I recall any other relevant information, but many of our illustrious members are also WoG players, so perhaps you guys can add to this description in order to make it more accurate? Conlaoch, Grizzled_dwarflord, Kail Pendragon, Foojin, Mithril Jack and many others are among the regular players. If there's anything else I may have forgotten, I'm sure they'll mention it in no time!<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<br/>\n<em><br/>\nedit: per Hip 20170517, added link to WoG requirements</em></div>"

      "content": "<div>The crafting system has also been enhanced.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe crafting system was developed by TK (The_Krit).  This allows the level of the spells to scale up with the caster during crafting.  Another nice addition is that all wands are automatically created with 50 charges.  For instance, using Magic Missile as an example, we have the following chart.<br/>\n<div class=\"codebox\"><p>Code: <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"selectCode(this); return false;\">Select all</a></p><pre><code>Spell                   Caster Level   Scribe GP   Scribe XP   Craft GP   Craft XP   Brew GP  Brew XP\nMagic Missile                  3            75            3                2250         90           ---       --- \nMagic Missile                  5           125           5                3750        150           ---       --- \nMagic Missile                  9           225           9                6750        270           ---       --- </code></pre></div>\n\nThis means that as your caster grows, his crafting ability does as well.  A lvl 13 wiz makes a wand that casts top rated Magic missiles.  Thats 5 missile per charge.  This scaling affects all of the spells available.  Scrolls scale as well, so lets take Chain Lightning as an example. <br/>\n<div class=\"codebox\"><p>Code: <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"selectCode(this); return false;\">Select all</a></p><pre><code>Spell                   Caster Level   Scribe GP   Scribe XP   Craft GP   Craft XP   Brew GP  Brew XP\nChain Lightning               11      1650          66         ---        ---       ---       --- \nChain Lightning               15      2250          90         ---        ---       ---       --- \nChain Lightning               20      3000         120         ---        ---       ---       ---  </code></pre></div>\n\nAs its higher then a 3rd and 4th lvl spell, you'll notice that you can't craft or brew chain lightning, but it can be scribed.  It also scales to lvl 20 when your caster is of a high enough level.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis adds a great amount of depth and versatility to your casters.  It also makes it really useful to pick up the craft wand and scribe scroll feats on your clerics, druids, sorcs, bards and paladins.<br/>\nImagine a cleric that has a stack of Lvl 20 Hammer of the Gods to use as a diversion if things to badly, or a paladin with a wand of Bless Weapon or Divine Favor.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the spell changes and the crafting charts can be found in the Server Rules area of the WoG website.

      "content": "<div>Hey all...<br/>\n I wanted to add just a small bite to the large meal that Max laid out for you all in regards to WoG. \u00a0 It's been my main home away from home for some 10 years now. \u00a0And I have yet to get tired of the place. \u00a0 I play alot solo and have a weekly group that has been running pretty much since I started playing. \u00a0And even though we have been playing this long, we still get surprised on a run at times. \u00a0 There's nothing like running head on into an area you thought you knew like the back of your hand... \u00a0only to find out that a DM has logged on and is now running your party through the wringer!<br/>\n A good handful of the areas that Max made mention of have been put into place since I joined \u00a0and a few have opened up within the last few years. \u00a0The DM's like to keep us on our toes. \u00a0 There has even been talk of new changes, fixes and areas in the works.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, as well as the places that Max mentioned, that are a few areas that while not really Quest areas, are large and have a few Quests in them. These being:<br/>\n<br/>\n UnderMountain: \u00a0A very large place, with a few areas that scale very nicely. \u00a0I once took a toon from 1st level to 12th just running through this place. \u00a0 You can go from a fight with Kobolds in one room, walk down a hall and find your self facing War Trolls... \u00a0Can be tricky, but much fun... \u00a0Just keep you eyes open for the old Dwarf Lord... \u00a0He's been wandering in there for years looking for his pants....<br/>\n<br/>\n There is an Area that I call the Sand Lands (mainly because I always forget the true name for it) Which leads off into even more sandy areas... \u00a0All hot and tough. \u00a0Make sure ya bring water.... \u00a0You can find some really tough Quests out in these areas, but some of the most fun is had in the places that have no Quests.<br/>\n<br/>\n One last thing: \u00a0WoG was built by DM Raine to be a party world, it is very tough on a solo toon. \u00a0To make 5th level sometimes can be very frustrating to say the least. \u00a0 The Moathouse and ToEE areas have clamed that down a good bit, but still... \u00a0Soloing can be tricky. \u00a0As GDL has been know to put it: \u00a0\"Be sure to pack a lunch!\" \u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n I look forward to seeing you all there! \u00a0 And no matter where you play, remember: \u00a0Good Hunting!!<br/>\n<br/>\n Grom</div>"

      "content": "<div>Its amazing. 1 monk level gives, to your forms:<br/>\n- Extra AC from Wisdom which can be crazily buffed with Druid's Owl's Insight. At level 13 (D12/M1) I get +8AC from wisdom alone. Thats like a whole mundane full plate. Or 40% reduced enemy chance to hit, if their AB is within appropriate range of your AC.<br/>\n- Further AC from tumble dump, (I took M1 at lvl 7, so +10 tumble = 2 more AC). +10 AC is approximately 50% reduced enemy chance to hit (give or take certain conditions).<br/>\n- Extra attacks. at level 13 my bear does 4 attacks with flurry with like 34 strength. Without Monk I would only do two attacks. So basically doubles your damage output.<br/>\n- +2 to all saves<br/>\n- Cleave, Evasion and Improved unarmed strike feats for free.<br/>\n- I did take skill dumps in Listen, Hide and Move Silently as well which Monk provides as a class skill, and Druid has an excess of skill points. So I can play as a stealthy monk bear if I want.<br/>\n<br/>\nI read through quite a few 'dragon build' posts before I started playing druid. I seem to recall Kail Pendragon writing he wouldn't take any dragon / polymorph build without monk in it seriously and I can see why.<br/>\n<br/>\n50% reduced enemy chance to hit (which improves as your wisdom increases) combined with doubled damage output = roughly quadrupled effectiveness of your polymorphed forms.<br/>\n<br/>\nI finished the main quest for Borderkeep now (Goblin, Orc and Kobold chiefs defeated) and am looking for new areas to explore. I pretty much finished it as a Monk Bear with druid buffs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was thinking I could use further two levels of Rogue for skill dumps at 21 and perhaps 37. Having Search, Disable Trap, Spot, UMD, Listen and Tumble as class skills to skill dump into plus a little sneak attack damage just sounds too good to pass.</div>"

If you are relying on DR, you also need some way to get immunity to crit, otherwise you can still die pretty easily to even normal enemies.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also a handful of enemies that simply cannot be beaten by DR. Even with a build that revolves around DR will have trouble with WDK or Orcus.\u00a0</div></blockquote>\nMy own Lvl 21 Druid 20/Monk 1, even with ridiculous buffs to AC from maximum wisdom, Owl's Insight and Barkskin doesn't quite reach the targets recommended by KoL except in Water Elemental form. For example I think my AC is 38 in caster and bear form. I think I get to 47 AC with the Water Elemental but every monster seems to cast greater dispelling so I'm hesitant to use that form as a tank as my buffs are prone to be removed. I'm relying a lot on Greater Stoneskin and Premonition to survive, and whenever it wears off I re-cast it. If I wanted to reach the targets I could take Improved Expertise, but that comes at a cost of AB. I think the comment on immunity to crit is in regards to devastating critical being in the module.</div>"

Get something else instead of snake blood, \"expertise\" would still be my suggestion for that slot. Swap positions between\u00a0 armour skin &amp; epic prowess. Also, do that for your pre-epic feats, first should be IKD then IC &amp; Toughness should be last or just before Gr. Cleave. Max-out your spellcraft by taking-out 15 points from search. Your UMD is good where is at, you can scroll-cast without failure by just being a Bard. I like that you're taking your milestone feats (Dev. Crit &amp; EWS) earlier in your second build.</div>"

I could add entangle to the combo as well, but I find it is overkill. In parties I'll have to make sure teammates have freedom cast on them and possibly use entangle instead of grease (if they don't have knockdown immunity). I think SoV stacks, like Arbas and co. did die pretty quickly<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it will be harder if I'm using Mogheiden against him, I'm sure. I've got her to level 6 or 7 now, so slowly getting there.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I am making use of ESF:Necromancy for sure with FoD/Slay living, its great against enemies with low fortitude saves (rogues/mages). Drown is ok when it works.\u00a0Harm is also super strong if I can hit them, even if its nerfed to 250hp damage, that is still sizable.\u00a0<br/>\n<blockquote><div>It took me a while to recognize Arbas in this dungeon.

Both fine stuff for warriors.</div></blockquote>\nSorry I can't remember a hammer maybe there was one but I would have sold it. There was definitely a very nice light flail I think +3 or +4 or something, did additional negative energy damage (very nice!) but I couldn't use it, again sold it. There was some plate armor which was nice but I sold it. He has a shield which gives +char and allows you to cast greater eagle splendor (I think) and a ring which provides fear immunity and +char and persuade.\u00a0 He and his henchmen dropped a lot of loot. I made sure I sold it in the Adventurer's Guild shop as most of it sold over 50k gold (I think many of the 'lesser' merchants have this as a cap).\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nWoG now has a bank, so I've stashed over 800k gold in my account now. It's just protection in case I die on the battlefield, losing 10% of the gold being carried is a pain. I'm also scribing scrolls wherever possible, uses up some of this gold and its just so handy in case I use up all my prepared spells, to have 40-50 heal scrolls, 20-30 summon creature IX/premonition/stonehold/freedom/slay living scrolls in my bags etc etc I probably should also stash a few more FoD scrolls while I'm at it...

The crab was a good example, although its funny as.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdjusting on the fly is tough. I think the quickbar is key. I don't think anyone's done a guide on optimal quickbar usage in NWN and I can't find a lot out there. Honestly having a potion of heal / invisibility / speed on that quickbar can be a lifesaver, I nearly died again in that same dungeon from like a huge mob of stealthy rogues surprise backstabbing me, I had like 300hp and the bar just dropped down super quickly, when I popped that invis potion and was able to run a reasonable distance to escape detection. Great design by the way. Keeps players and parties on their toes. I imagine for a wizard, having that Time Stop scroll on the quickbar can be a huge lifesaver too.\u00a0<br/>\n<blockquote><div><strong>Stagmeister:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nMmm, crab linguini all around.

It's a good arrangement. Players starting in a new persistent world such as WoG which is super tough will want to have well designed builds, and ECB is a good place to go for help! Likewise ECB members will want to test out their builds in the toughest environments, and WoG is definitely challenging and feels like a worthwhile place to try out builds. <strong>Edit: DM Wise also pinned it right to the top of the character building section :)</strong></div>"

Thanks for your comment and reading this thread! Very happy for you to ask a question!\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly to clarify, I am character level 30 right now. I took every great wisdom feat available to me (including bonus feats from Druid) from level 21 onwards until character level 29. It allowed me to get Wisdom 30 at Level 29, and take the Dragon Shape feat at level 30.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy wisdom can be further buffed by a spell called 'Owl's Insight' which adds Wisdom of a value of half the druid level to a maximum of 12 (which is the cap). At level 24, the recipient reaches the cap.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yes I have wisdom 42 at level 29-30 when fully buffed! It makes my spell DC very nasty, and gives me a lot of AC from Monk Wisdom AC.</div>"

Thanks for your comment and reading this thread! Very happy for you to ask a question!\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly to clarify, I am character level 30 right now. I took every great wisdom feat available to me (including bonus feats from Druid) from level 21 onwards until character level 29. It allowed me to get Wisdom 30 at Level 29, and take the Dragon Shape feat at level 30.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy wisdom can be further buffed by a spell called 'Owl's Insight' which adds Wisdom of a value of half the druid level to a maximum of 12 (which is the cap). At level 24, the recipient reaches the cap.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yes I have wisdom 42 at level 29-30 when fully buffed! It makes my spell DC very nasty, and gives me a lot of AC from Monk Wisdom AC.\n</div></blockquote>\nI have just read some info on nwn wiki...duration: 1 hour per level, that's a very high duration (especially if extended).....<br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, last time I played WoG I ended up with a 32 lv bard.fighter.rdd.....I would like to know (before making another playthrough), if<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>you have finished all the Critwall quests, as I need to finish the last one (recover an item) and I have a little clue about where this item should be, but I would like to have some confirmations....\n</details></div>"

I selected wait for help because I did want a few screenshots of this moment, and the menu was in the way.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nNormally when one dies you can select respawn later even if you initially click wait for help, but it isn't the case if you are petrified, which I learned later.<br/>\n<br/>\nThankfully I discovered the only action you can undertake whilst petrified is cancelling polymorph form. It allowed the enemies to kill me and allowed me to respawn. Ie. in dragon form my DR is 40/+6, the medusae couldn't do damage against me even if they critical hit me, in human form my DR is 0 (when premonition runs out)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo all is good in the world again and I have learned something!</div>"

With extended spell I could have quite a few castings of these plus scrolls too. If they dont dispel them I can fight in these grease pits / storms/stonehold clouds<br/>\n- I should have cast a summon before battle, and my animal companion<br/>\n- I should have a whole bunch of buffing potions, perhaps Barkskin, Death Armor,\u00a0<br/>\n- Improved invisibility provides 50% concealment, would reduce the damage done to me<br/>\n- I have a spell sequencer robe which can store two defensive spells, which would probably be Owl's Insight + Spell Resistance\u00a0<br/>\n- I can use a trap or two although I fail to see how effective they would be<br/>\n- Webshaman taught me that if I get some piercing DR I would be able to pierce Epic Warding when shifted, although the battle lasted long enough that Epic Warding wore off...<br/>\n- Some breach scrolls maybe good against Lord Vayne, as well as Natures Balance to drop the spell resistance<br/>\n<br/>\n- and of course get a party together to deal with these ruffians, and if I get petrified, well, they can turn me back to flesh!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, time to mull over these ideas... what an interesting problem...<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: also Lord Vayne is a Cleric / Palemaster, so the damage he's doing to me is probably from the darkfire buff, so Red Dragon would have been better than Green... also I'm reading from the forum his AC is sky high, perhaps I should have been targeting Althea...<br/>\nalso I'm reading that parties are having trouble taking one of them on at a time - I took both of them on at once! what a silly bugger I am</div>"

I'll edit this post when I find out some results.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sure Kail and Thax would have pointed this out if they were still around, I could also improve my gameplay by further buffing myself with extended Blood Frenzy and Aura of Vitality to reach the strength cap for tough fights to get more AB/damage, the duration would be 72 rounds with a caster level of 36. Might help against Lord Vayne when I re-attempt that fight to try to get through that high cleric/palemaster AC.

You weren't exaggerating regarding its length and packing a lunch. I used about four secure shelters just to get through the barricade / brass hills and complete the basement section of Rary fortress! Going to have to go back to complete the next section!<br/>\n<br/>\nCool things I observed -&gt; enemy clerics using raise dead scrolls, big arcane spell casters using time stop / mords / IGMS / breaches etc, double wielding horsemen with ITWF, stealthy assassins with epic dodge (holy moly), Rary's guards switching between dual wield dire maces and single handed weapon and shield, every spell caster spamming greater dispelling / dispel magic - its just magnificient<br/>\n<br/>\nI took a few screenshots just for fun!

Great against mobs of fighters due to their poor reflex and will saves. Not so great against arcane spellcasters who can use AOE dispel magic abilities to remove these AOE spells due to the way the mechanics work\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n<img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://attachment.tapatalk-cdn.com/2742/201907/10759084_5ee1feeae4f782582925c69a70976248_t.jpg\"/><br/>\nThis was a glorious battle.

If one is smart with targeting the right save/vulnerability it is still very useful. Like I could have had a DC of 28 or something and it would still be very effective against that mob. A Will DC of 40 might be good against a mob of clerics/druids but then they might just cast freedom anyway and my spell is not that useful. Anyway I guess my build is what it is I guess!<br/>\n<br/>\nI still can't find that door in Shattados palace ruins! Put a robe of eyes and watchman's helm on too, to get my search score up to 42 combed the walls (admittedly as a human rather than elf 'rogue')! I think I'm totally satisfied with combat with Rary anyway and Juiblex can wait for another day, another playthrough, the amount of material just to finish the basement was massive</div>"

Being short I just would like to now exactly what kind of world it is. Low/mid/high magic? What is max Armor/Dodge/Deviation AC or weapon enchantment you can get with no buff? What about stats? It'possible to hit the cap with items on all stats or not? RP is needed or not? What about pk/pvp? Thanks to everyone in advance.<br/>\nACE</div>"

Keep plugging away and dont get disheartened!\u00a0</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:#000000\">If you aren't dying then either you are super skilled, the build is uber powered, or the area you are playing in is too easy for you :)</span><br/>\n<br/>\n<em><span style=\"color:#000000\">Low/mid/high magic?\u00a0</span></em><br/>\n<br/>\n- Mid magic<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>What is max Armor/Dodge/Deviation AC or weapon enchantment you can get with no buff?\u00a0</em><br/>\n<br/>\n- +5, there are extremely rare +6 items<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>What about stats? It'possible to hit the cap with items on all stats or not?\u00a0</em><br/>\n<br/>\n- Realistically the stat cap can be reached with items for one stat.

There is no role playing police running around so to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Alignment restrictions do apply to builds. It is not possible to have a Bard / Monk for example, or a Paladin / Blackguard.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>What about pk/pvp?\u00a0</em><br/>\n<br/>\n- PvP is allowed but not encouraged, as the server is designed for player versus monster.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Excessive player killing by individuals should be reported in the forums, and further action can be taken.</div>"

      "content": "<div>I largely play WoG for a challenging environment playtesting my builds and that does include both action and RP elements and enjoyment etc. Agree wands of MM are very strong and only require UMD 1 to use.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaytesting wise For example I have got my lawful evil Blackguard Executioner build to the mid 30s. He greets other players in the Adventurers guild with the most creepy sounding 'Hello' I could find in the voice pack, his battlecry is 'Your remains shall decorate my home'. Mind you, being lawful evil, he tries his best to 'conceal' his evil nature.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example:<br/>\nAshal Hald (my character): 'Do not be afraid, I am but a simple knight.\u00a0<br/>\nOther player: 'Heh and I am a very clever mage'<br/>\nAshal Hald:\u00a0'The black garb I wear is simply the cladding of my very noble order'\u00a0<br/>\nAshal Hald: 'I perform a very simple task for my order with my curved blade, well below the dignity of my \"betters\", and boy do I *like* curved blades...'<br/>\nOther player: 'And that might\u00a0 be?'<br/>\nAshal Hald: 'Why execution of course! Time consuming to prepare the weapon, but required for maximum efficiency'<br/>\nOther player: 'What a cheery thought to go to sleep on'<br/>\nAshal Hald: 'Oh I assure you I sleep quite well! Certain individuals have committed quite tremendous crimes in this world, heinous crimes in fact! Without their presence, the world is but a safer place...'<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so on and so forth<br/>\n<br/>\nCombat wise whilst he can tank with 500 odd HP &amp; heavy armor/tower he prefers to get his Vrock to take the damage whilst sneak attacking/critting/dev critting his enemies to death. Other cheese includes drinking an invisibility potion / use a ring of invisibility, creep up to an unsuspecting opponent, then suddenly Improved Knockdown/8d6 Sneak Attack/Critical hit for like 100 damage / crit hit with a keen scimitar +4 -&gt; dead within a round.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhereas my Professor of War is more \u00a0is 1v1 dueling. Meet my greatsword buffed with UMD etc at 50+ str / AB 60+, improved knockdown / improved disarm are my favorites. He still gets big 100+ damage crits as well. He\u00a0was partying with a very noble paladin of Hoeder's, defeated a difficult opponent, and we discovered the enemy's lair and enormous amounts of treasure.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe noble paladin stated 'The treasure is yours, a good deed is its own reward'.\u00a0<br/>\nWhereas my Professor stated 'I am but an academic and I have a simple lifestyle which my professorial salary covers. Please the treasure is yours, even Paladins have operating costs?'.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI think in the end we both left the area, <em>leaving the treasure behind</em>!<br/>\n<br/>\nI try not to speed level, like I mean if I'm in a hurry sure it can be done, perhaps I can't do it as well as the others, but I do want to experience what it is like playing at low levels with my character, and if it isn't enjoyable I will make some adjustments to the character. For example with my Blackguard Executioner I discovered taking 8 levels of rogue as a high strength low dex build is not fun when you can only wear light armor, no shield, and run around with 13 AC, to level him required UMD, so I made adjustments to the build to take fighter earlier, and it was much more playable. He could still use UMD, but it wasn't required with full plate / tower to protect him.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yes I try to experience all aspects of game play when playtesting and I think that rushing too fast can mean you miss out on some stuff, that being said when you have leveled a character to 15+ so many times certain areas/regions get repetitive (ie Moathouse) and rushing through those levels can have merit, although personally I like to know how my character fares against the bosses of certain areas compared with other builds I've played...</div>"

I also enjoy the immersion of playing a well designed module and the shared fun of portraying different characters and interacting with them in good roleplay on a PW.<br/>\nSome people say these things cannot be combined or united. I say they can.\u00a0<br/>\nThere are good and bad builds and there is good and bad roleplay. It is possible to enjoy both and even be good at both.<br/>\nYou don't have to be a bad roleplayer to be a good builder or a bad builder to be a good roleplayer. That is just the stereotypical thinking of some people.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to roleplay a character with flaws, (a thing that sometimes can make roleplaying more interesting,) a good builder is able to create a build with those flaws.<br/>\nBut strictly speaking, you don't even need a buildat all, if all you want to do is to portray a character/personality. You only need an avatar to be able to act. That can be as simple as a level 1 character of any class. You can roleplay being a mage without ever casting a spell in public. You can pretend to be a soldier, never picking up a sword when on leave, etc. etc.<br/>\nBut once you want to go out there hacking and slashing, then you need a build that can handle it.

It should not be taken as the gospel, or best way to power level.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy personal \"list\" looks far, far different, and I am very confident that anyone who plays WoG for awhile solo will have their own, personal \"list\" custom fitted to their experiences and interests.\u00a0 My personal list is pretty...far outside the box.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have tried doing BK first, then progressing from there.\u00a0 There are some advantages to doing it that way, but for the most part, Hommlet&amp;Surrounds just has more stuff laying around, and easy for the taking.\u00a0 YMMV.\u00a0 <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the frogs, etc, of Hommlet are among the easiest and best foes that one can have on WoG for beginning levels.\u00a0 No missle weapons, slow, easy to spot.\u00a0 One can easily kite them on a Horse with any type of missle weapon, even with the huge malus to ranged on horseback.\u00a0 It's insta-level.\u00a0 Inside the Moathouse is pretty easy as well, especially the first level of it, and there is ample treasure, xp, etc for a solo player there.<br/>\n<br/>\nKobolds, Goblins, and Orcs, on the other hand (not to mention Gnolls) are killer for beginning players.\u00a0 Even for experienced players, it's dirtnap city without the proper hps, protections, etc.\u00a0 The opponents stealth, have magic, use missle weapons, and are in HUGE numbers.\u00a0 And there are traps.\u00a0 Without a solid, thought-out strategy and approach (and prior knowledge), one will dirtnap backwards xp wise.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, the list is just an aid, nothing more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm done here.</div>"

If so, one problem which seems common is that the server checks for haks in your folder by their names with no capital letters, while some of the files you download have caps in their names. <br/>\nNot sure about Mac, but that was definitely the issue on my linux machine (Windows seems not to care). Renaming them worked for me. <br/>\nI think I also had to rename mountainsnow.hak to mountainsnow3.hak or vice versa. I agree that posting on the WoG forum is a good idea, people are knowledgeable and helpful. <br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my SM-G920F using Tapatalk<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hey guys! I have finally finished reading all 27 pages of this topic! Geezzuzz!!!\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd like to offer my 2 cents about a few of the things I read in my absence.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em class=\"mention\">@Orion</em>\u00a0it's great to see how you went on your first exploration of WoG. I remember when I started there, it was truly fabulous!<br/>\n<br/>\n<em class=\"mention\">@Stagmeister</em>\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing about WoG is that there ARE opportunities for both kinds of players to find enjoyment. There are areas where you could powerlevel, but don't misconstrude the server as a place where group of maniac powerlevelers test different cheesy strategies. There are those who have fun doing that, and the server has areas where that can be done. However, a more RP-oriented player such as yourself CAN find plenty of enjoyment in the module.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou say you like to explore a module to \"unravel\" the story. On WoG there are MULTIPLE stories to unravel. I think how it differs from a SP module, is that instead of a linear story, you have MANY stories to choose from, which means you can play a character to level 40 doing some quests, then you can make another character, start in a different area, and do a completely different \"quest route\" and reach level 40 without repeating a single quest!! And these quests DO have well-constructed narratives and the epic ones DO feel epic. Or you can take the approach of an \"explorer\" and try to level up by exploring Undermountain, RPing that your character's goal is to \"unravel the secrets\" of the world's most famous and dangerous dungeon. There is literally room for everyone.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em class=\"mention\">@Empyre65</em>\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I were you, I wouldn't do all quests listed in that file in the order they're listed. I'd separate them into \"bulks\" and do multiple runs. Otherwise they might become too easy, because you'll be doing them at a higher level than you're supposed to. Like Grizz said, when you go to the Shield Lands at 20th level, you'll find TOUGH battles out there, and the boss battles will be truly epic! If you get there nearing level 30 (which invariably will happen if you follow that guide), then you'll only find challenge in the boss battles, and by the time you finish, you'll be level 40. IMO, the way to go when you're exploring the server is to feel what it's like and learn the quests at the level they're supposed to be played. Then, after you know, you can make your own list.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are a few routes you might want to follow:<br/>\n<br/>\n1- You could start in Hommlet into ToEE into <strong>Gang Menace, into High Seas Justice, into Recovery of the Light, into Public Crypts, into Muddy Bird (all Bold quests are in GH)</strong>, into Hill Giants, into Frost Giants, into Duergar Caves, into Manscorpion King, into Volte. This will probably get you to early-mid 20s and you'll finish up in the desert. Then from there there are many options.<br/>\n<br/>\n2- You could start in Borderkeep, do all quests there (Kobolds, Goblins, Orcs and Gnolls), into Kron Necromancer, into Dragon Cult Caves, into Bandit Chief Ashalt, into Hugo the Bandit King, into Ghost Tower of Inverness, into Scorpion Crown into Dragon Cult GH and Dino Island into Shield Lands.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the 3rd character could start at Ruskis and do Shipwreck's quests, Fish Head Menace, etc... by then you should have sufficient knowledge of the server to make your own quest route. You'll also have your favorite quests that you don't want to miss for the world. I for example LOVE the Ghost Tower of Inverness quest. I never miss it. It's SO COOL!!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are multiple quests one can do. My advice is to do them at the level they're supposed to be done at least once, to see how challenging they are and test yourself to overcome the challenges. No matter how well-balanced a server is, if you do a 12th level quest at level 20, it WILL be too easy. Now, if you're able to finish ToEE at level 14 like Grizz, then you can call yourself a truly EPIC adventurer.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's my 2 cents!\u00a0</div>",

My other character definitely took a different path, but I barely remember it as it was about a year ago. I think he fell down a hole, explored a bit, and then ended up on an elemental plane. He then got clobbered by earth elementals... and maybe a \u00a0roper? It wasn't a pleasant experience for a lone rogue lol. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think he skipped the 2nd floor entirely. <br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my SM-G955U using Tapatalk</div></blockquote>\nFor the purposes of the quest, the 1st and 2nd floors aren't essential, but I think if you're going to do ToEE, do ToEE. Biggest problem I have there is I can't possibly carry / fit so much loot in my inventory. Soloing that place means you'll have to ignore most of the loot in the corpses in order to make it to the end unencumbered. I was never able to. What I used to do was do floors 1 and 2, then go back to Nulb to sell, then do floors 3 and 4 (you can access them directly, but I won't spoil that for you), then back to Nulb to sell, then nodes and final boss. There are some chests and corpses where you can leave your loot and come back for it when you're heading back to sell.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you can break that adventure into 3 more digestible sections, as I suggested above. The problem is that, although you can do that, you'd need to sort of skip all but the unskippable parts of the 3rd and 4th floors, since they're the only way to get to the nodes, otherwise it might take your entire session to get back to where you left off. Knowing where you can rest in this place is also vital! Ok, I don't want to spoil your fun, so I'll stop here.</div>",

It's the only bugged area on WoG. Just take a quick hike around Castle Hart, but you can't go in because they never fixed it before moving WoG to EE. Over there it's working well. So, what you're looking for is a corpse that has an item called Love Letter. Find it and take it to Vaalstinean's Bardic College, to an NPC named Lady Illuvien. That'll wrap up the West quests.\n</details>\n\nTo the East, there is a VAST expanse to explore. The scenery and area design is BREATHTAKING, the enemies are EPIC and there are some VERY TOUGH bosses to be found. There are several aras to explore, which I will list below for your reference:<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>The Great Northern Crusade part is kiling Waquinos inside Docamald Keep. It may be a little annoying to get the drawbridge lowered, but you can figure it out. Inside, you'll also find the Chalice of Heironeous, which needs to be delivered to Count Franz Thorkeep in the Critwall Castle for another quest.\n</details>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>The Great Effluvial Swamp and surroundings. There is only one \"quest\", which is probably the most annoying one to complete. There are also many areas to explore, which are awesome adventures, but not quests per se (meaning they don't have a Journal entry associated with them):\n- The Effluvial Swamp\n- Bottom of the Pit\n- Stone Giant Caves\n- White Plume Mountain (possibly the one you thought was in the West). You'll need a few Search-boosting items to successfully complete this one.\n</details>\n\nIf you decide to do the whole East in one go, it'll be a VERY LONG adventure, so pack a lunch! Also, if you do that, leave the Heart of the Swamp for last. You'll know why when you get there (just trying to save you the annoyance). PM me if you'd like more details.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAlternatively, you can just do the Great Northern Crusade and then head towards the North. That's the beauty of WoG. You can choose the order. :D<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is EPIC. I think you'll LOVE it! Cheers!</div>",

Luckily, DevCrit has the capability to simplify some really tough battles! Good thing you got rid of the bastard Waquinos. Good job!<br/>\n<br/>\nC'mon man! Don't skip Emeraxis! He's one of the staples of the swamp! For battles such as these, you should carry around a stack of Lesser Spell Breach and Greater Spell Breach scrolls. I understand that in Single Player it's tougher to handle shopping, but you should visit the Greyhawk Library, Guild of Wizardry and Adventurer's Guild every time you're in town to get supplies. That's what I was telling you about. It's a 4th level spell that will completely change the outcome of this battle.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nTo access the Rift Canyon, you need to buy a Rope of Climbing, which you can find in the Knife Edge Pass. You can also try Vaalstinian's Bardic Academy. I don't remember, but they might sell them there as well. I recommend that you buy a couple, not just one, and stick them in a bag. You never know when you'll need them. I really don't recommend you skip the Rift Canyon. It's truly EPIC! The design is amazing, and the adventures make you feel like a real hero!!! But, I'd go to White Plume Mountain first.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave fun!</div>",

The only chance a Breach won't breach anything is if there isn't anything to be breached. The difference between Lesser and Greater Spell Breach is the number of protective spells removed, and the amount by which Spell Resistance is lowered (2 and 4 respectively). Do you know the order in which these spells are removed? I ask this because in battles where enemies have multiple protective buffs (and you're going to run into a few of them from now on, that's a good way to decide whether to cast Lesser Spell Breach, Greater Spell Breach or even Mordenkainen's Disjunction.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's a link to the Wiki:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Breach\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://nwn.fandom.com/wiki/Breach</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThe spells will remove these protections counting from 1-32 until it removes its maximum number of spells, and then the remaining protections will stay active. So, if the enemy has many protections at the same time, these will require multiple breaches, especially because Mestil's Acid Sheath is only number 14 on the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor this battle, just Lesser Spell Breach should suffice, since she only casts that one buff.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck! Post a screenshot after your victory, will you?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!</div>",

Then, up the opposite side of the canyon is the lair of the Stone Giant King. Really nice adventure there! After that you can backtrack to the swamp and do the Heart of the Swamp.

Struggling with domain decision <br/>\n<br/>\n1) travel-trickery is a default one<br/>\n2) summons are superstrong early, but I guess will be weaker later and at 40. Are they viable lategame? Should even consider them to so some tanking job there? <br/>\n<br/>\nHence questions:<br/>\n- is animal worth considering for summon buff? There is no option to pair it with trickery or travel though. War, plant and earth are somewhat usefull. <br/>\n<br/>\n- are spell lvl 8-9 summons strong enogh to get more caster lvls at the cost of lowering AB from naked 50 in my plan to 45-47 range?<br/>\n<br/>\nArcher with summons looks so strong early lvls but I have doubts investing in them for end build</div>"

I had my doubts about short travel/trickery benefits. But you also get 3 slow spells with travel though <br/>\nI proposed two type builds in requests section, both divine might clerics: melee fighter and an archer. <br/>\nNow I finally decided to choose WoG after reading about other PW, and the archer build is not so contraversive as melee one, so I decided to start with it <br/>\n<br/>\nI was hoping to avoid diving in build details, but here is the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://contraversive\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">thread</a>. There is a comparative table of various cleric/AA ratios, now I am leaning towards zen archer with cleric lvls in 12-16 range:\u00a0<br/>\n- naked AB is 48-50, multiple cleric buffs will easily bump it over 55 (but being dispellable, I don't rely on them too much, but +5 GWE is there for sure)<br/>\n- called shot<br/>\n- zen and high wis will allow to get more spellslots with limited cleric lvls. <br/>\nEssentially this looks like tweaking <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/ultra-ab-arcane-archer-cleric-12-wiz-1-aa-27-t2355002.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ultra AB archer</a>. <br/>\n- no UMD because of Wizard to avoid exp penalty<br/>\nIs going bard worth exp penalty? I'll get 20 free points for UMD in that case with bard If I leave tumble at 20.<br/>\n<br/>\n@webshaman1, I am planning mostly solo, joining party only if one is available (I am bad at scheduling my gaming time). I guess in solo play summons are more important<br/>\nHere are current build essentials at 40 for 12 lvl Cleric with AB 50:<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>\n\nAttack Bonus: 28 (melee), 50 (Longbow)\nSTR: 13\nCON: 6\nWIS: 16(22)\n\nBAB: 26\nAC (2H/TWF): 23 (Full Plate)\nDetailed Spellcasting (0-9): Wizard: 4 \u2022 3, Cleric: 6 \u2022 8 \u2022 7 \u2022 6 \u2022 5 \u2022 5 \u2022 4\nfeats: divine might, zen, rapid/called shots, all required for AA, all weapon and AB feats, epic stat feats\n</details>\nP.S.

Two-sided weapon can vary, as well as replaced for kukri. <br/>\n<br/>\n- Devcrit (STR 32) and HiPS<br/>\n<br/>\n- Hitpoints: 450+<br/>\n- BAB: 30, naked AB: 52 (Dire Mace)<br/>\n- AC (naked/clothing): 22<br/>\n- AC (2H/TWF): 29 (Full Plate)<br/>\n- Saving Throws (Fortitude/Reflex/Will): 20/22/15 (pretty poor)<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscipline: 26(37) / Hide: 43(45) / Intimidate: 4(3) / Listen: 43(42) / Move Silently: 43(45) / Spellcraft: 20(23) / Tumble: 40(42) / <br/>\n<br/>\nNon-devcrit version get's HP to 500 or saving throws feats,\u00a0 and has knockdown/IKD (for that annoying casters!). May be this path is better, since dire mace cant even be keen (may be it can with a gem, not sure, especially after i made it's damage slashing...). But the cool thing here is that we don't need to sacrifice any AB to get devcrit in case of this build<br/>\n<br/>\nTried ranger and monk combos as well, but this seems most curious to me.\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary><strong>Shadowdancer(2), Fighter(10), Weaponmaster(28)</strong>\nRace: <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></details>\n\nSo that's what I had on my mind:) Thanks for asking!<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.

For example, we don't want waste the gems for a socketed gauntlet on a 2h build, because that slot is reserved for shielding bracers, which are a must. Necklace is for natural armor. Boots are for haste. Hence we'd better spend our precious gems on some other item. So that is the kind of \"best practices\" I'd like to know<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich stats do we want for a multiple socket cloak for example? Freedom comes to mind for example. Do we want regen on a main items or it's better to make a separate \"regen item set\" to replenish health outside a fight without having to rest? or may be it is worth spending a slot in each socketed item to get this regen during battles? <br/>\n<br/>\nI realize I'll only see answers if that doesn't break the \"DM Wise Law\"</div>"

O_o) - I had that happen once, lost some irreplaceable items that way (stuff from way back when that one could get that one cannot anymore).\u00a0 You can go on some adventures (I will not say which ones, because that would be spoiling things) that also have some...things that can happen that can remove all your items (ALL of them).<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are also other creatures that are like Rusties as well...<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and you can get Disarmed, and lose your weapon on the ground (though you should be able to find it again, if one looks, unless there is a server reset, and then you are SoL).<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is the best advice for adventuring in an area you know nothing about - carry a ranged weapon in your hands (and not your melee weapon).\u00a0\u00a0 You'll thank me for this little tip on WoG.</div>"

      "content": "<div>There are several ways to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne involves wands, the other involves abusing Druids.\u00a0 Of course, one can do both!<br/>\n<br/>\nI will say that a Cleric/Druid/Rog is amazingly powerful, if built correctly.\u00a0 I used that build to basically do the \"no bling Undermountain nekkid challenge\" - meaning you only get your starting gear, and have to basically find whatever you can in UM (and you can only adventure there).\u00a0 Got to level 32.\u00a0 Oh, and it was Iron Man as well, so...no dying, or you start over fresh with a new PC.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the meta-knowledge comes into play.\u00a0 Knowing what where is, and how to kill it without dying (and getting massive XP awards for doing so).<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's basically a bit of meta-knowledge combined with MOAR firepower (which is basically your orderve).<br/>\n<br/>\nMy advice is always, first get a PC to level 40 by exploring and levelling on WoG, before you try fast levelling.\u00a0 That will give you some working knowledge of WoG, and help you avoid some newbie mistakes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut for the build above, you want to stack your Domains so that you \"rule the roost\" so to speak - so a Half-Elf (they get Wis+1 on WoG) Cleric of Sehanine Moonbow (Travel and Trickery!), with 1 level Druid (Animal Domain, yeah baby! Improved summons, what's not to like about that?) AND take Spell Focus : Conjuration AND pick up Greater Spell Focus : Conjuration (cuz, you know, better summons doubleplusgood!).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow you can use wands and scrolls from both Cleric and Druid sources (yeah, that's a hint), as well as wands of the same nature.\u00a0 Picking up a Rog level somewhere along the line will add UMD to your list of goodness, which basically means \"WOOOOHOOOOO! Give it to me, baby!\" and you are ready to rocket up in levels.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, well, yeah, it's super-mega-cheesey, sure.\u00a0 But, you know, if you like cheese like I do, well...enjoy!<br/>\n<br/>\nBest thing about it?\u00a0 Yeah, maybe you noticed - NO XP PENALTY!\u00a0 Holy crud Webbie, how'd you do it?\u00a0 Yeah, just keep your Druid and Rog levels roughly equal and you can be a Playah too!\u00a0 Besides, you want MOAR than 1 Druid level, for that beautiful immunity to Web, Entangle, and Grease, right??!!\u00a0 And Rog levels just gives you dumps GALORE!\u00a0 And Uncanny Dodge.\u00a0 And SA.\u00a0 And Tumble.\u00a0 And Open Locks, Disarm, which goes really well with your Trickery Domain!<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, it's sick!</div>"
