Why Knockdown? Seems a pointless Feat on an AA with 14 Str.<br/>\n2. Why not get 29 AA levels for the maximum bonus (or even 30 as you get a Bonus Feat)?<br/>\n3. Although you lose the extra Dex and full Elf abilities, Half-Elf allows you to take Bard, which gives you full Tumble and UMD, as well as Bard Song (which gets you back the AB you lost on Dex, plus some damage).<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess I'm thinking of something along the lines of F8/Bd3/AA29 or Bd4/F6/AA30.<br/>\n<br/>\nTBH is the Rapier stuff worth having? I mean he's not going to hurt a fly with one. Certainly not a boss with DR.\n</div></blockquote>\n1. I have no idea, as I said I just got the build and tried it. I'm open to improvements if anyone would like to set it up.<br/>\n2. See above.<br/>\n3. I understand the thinking of bard, but why drop Elf? You can be an elven bard.<br/>\n<br/>\nRapier is I think more of a convenience so you can go rapier/shield when it's crowded and you can't move back and fire undisturbed. It's not a necessity I think, but so far (lvl 22) I find it useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nThinking of the suggested build... You want bard 3 for the song. Bard 4 doesn't really give you anything extra (possibly 2 lvl 2 spells, if you spend enough charisma, which you won't). You want AA29 for the max bonus. The extra D6 explosive damage you get from AA30 is probably not very useful. So, Fighter 8/Bard 3/AA29 would probably be best. (If not, please explain why).\n</div></blockquote></div>"

But, then you can't use Bard level for Tumble/UMD skill dump. If you drop one AA level, you can just the same drop two, since 28 and 27 have the same bonus.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, what's better?
