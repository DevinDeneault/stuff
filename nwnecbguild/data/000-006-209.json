      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">This one build is made for the troops of Alexander the Great, they were the best trained spearmen in the known world and they were wielding the Sarisa (Macedonian long Lance) a very long spear that made them victorious in innumerable bettles. To give them resilience i went with Pale Master, to represent their superior training only Weapon Masters could fit the bill and to tie all these Bard had to be choosen. And although this combination looks feat-starved it comes out very nicely from start to finish with very good playability and power that only increases as the levels go up.<br/>\n<br/>\nTips for playing the Undead Phalanx: <br/>\n<br/>\nYou will want to start with a breastplate and tower shield wielding your morningstar till you have the boost in your AC from the early Pale master lvls. Then you can switch to Spear and never look back. In early epics you will get another boost to your Ac from your Full plate armour and the immunities from Pale master will keep you safe. Notice that you get Weapon's master augmented criticals before epic levels and skill dumps from intermediate Bard lvls along the road. The later Weapo master levels will make you a beast since they rise your Ab to a significant degree and give you all the epic feats you want in order of significance. With this build you will also have 4th lvl Bard Spells along with a good 11th lvl Bard Song, use them to further augment your power, in times that you need them.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuild Variation: Originally i made another workable build similar to this that has minor differences. It is a (BARD 9/ PM 12/ WM 19) that has 2nd lvl Bard spells and 9th lvl Bard song but +2 AC more and +4 Fortitude. It's structure is similar to this one, if you need further details i can post this one as well below. It is my opinion that the later is slightly stronger in a rich UMD environment like WoG, but anyway the differences are small and up to the personal taste of each one.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilar Builds: <br/>\n<br/>\n1) <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build213417.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Pale Weapon Master</a>, with similar split as mine but with pretty much lower stats and reduced playability.<br/>\n2) <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build253179.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Spear of the Cambions</a>, it has +2 AB more than mine but alas, only three attacks/round, a feeble Bard song and lower AC.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>UNDEAD PHALANX</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>(BARD 11/ PM 10/ WM 19)</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n RACE: Human<br/>\n<br/>\n ALIGNMENT: Neutral Evil<br/>\n<br/>\n PLAYABILITY: PvM 1 \u2013 40<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>STARTING/ ENDING STATS:</strong><br/>\n STR  - 15 (30)<br/>\n DEX - 13<br/>\n CON - 14<br/>\n INT   - 13<br/>\n WIS  - 08<br/>\n CHA - 14<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Hit Points: 414</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Skill Points: 200 {Remaining 21}</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Perform: 16 (18)<br/>\n<br/>\n Discipline: 43 (53)<br/>\n<br/>\n Tumble: 40 (41)<br/>\n<br/>\n Spellcraft: 39 (40)<br/>\n<br/>\n UMD: 33 (35)<br/>\n<br/>\n Intimidate: 4 (6) cc<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fort/Ref/Will): 20/ 24/ 21 \u2192 28/ 32/ 29 (saves Vs spells)<br/>\n<br/>\n Naked/ Armoured AC: 27/ 35/ 40 (Full plate) \u2192 {Expertise}<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n BAB: 26 (Four attacks)<br/>\n<br/>\n AB: +44/ +39/ +34/ +29 (Spear)<br/>\n<br/>\n DMG: 1D8 +15/ 17 \u2013 20 X4 (Spear)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong> Spellcasting: Bard 4th Circle of Spells &amp; UMD full Ranks</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Bard Song 11/ Day: +2 AB/ +2 AC/ +2 Dmg/ +2 To all Skills/ +1 To all Saves/ +8 Hp's<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>LEVELING GUIDE:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n01) Bard (01): Dodge, Mobility<br/>\n02) Bard (02): <br/>\n03) Bard (03): Expertise<br/>\n04) Bard (04): <br/>\n05) Bard (05): <br/>\n06) Bard (06): Weapon Focus (spear)<br/>\n07) Bard (07): <br/>\n08) Pale Master (01): <br/>\n09) Pale Master (02): Spring Attack<br/>\n10) Pale Master (03): <br/>\n11) Pale Master (04): <br/>\n12) Bard (08): Whirlwind Attack<br/>\n13) Weapons Master (01): <br/>\n14) Weapons Master (02): <br/>\n15) Weapons Master (03): Blind Fight<br/>\n16) Weapons Master (04): <br/>\n17) Weapons Master (05): <br/>\n18) Weapons Master (06): Knockdown<br/>\n19) Weapons Master (07): <br/>\n20) Weapons Master (08): <br/>\n21) Pale Master (05): Improved Critical (spear)<br/>\n22) Pale Master (06): <br/>\n23) Pale Master (07): <br/>\n24) Pale Master (08): Heavy Armour Proficiency<br/>\n25) Pale Master (09): <br/>\n26) Pale Master (10): <br/>\n27) Bard (9): Great Strength [1]<br/>\n28) Weapons Master (09): <br/>\n29) Weapons Master (10): <br/>\n30) Weapons Master (11): Great Strength [2]<br/>\n31) Weapons Master (12): <br/>\n32) Weapons Master (13): Epic Weapon Focus (spear)<br/>\n33) Bard (10): Great Strength [3]<br/>\n34) Weapons Master (14): <br/>\n35) Weapons Master (15): <br/>\n36) Weapons Master (16): Great Strength [4], Armour Skin<br/>\n37) Bard (11): <br/>\n38) Weapons Master (17): <br/>\n39) Weapons Master (18): Great Strength [5]<br/>\n40) Weapons Master (19): Epic Prowess<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>SPECIAL NOTES</strong>: <br/>\n<br/>\nImmune to Critical Hits/ Immune to Sneak Attacks<br/>\n<br/>\nImmune to Paralysis/ Immune to Holds/ Immune to Stuns<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

With the extra skill points from (14) Intellect i would max-out Taunt as a skill, thus having a pure 53 Taunt. Take last level as Bard if need be. That would be their famous (Come and Get it!) thing ;)<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
