Analysis and Comments by Author</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nEquipment<br/>\n2 Kukris<br/>\nFull Plate Mail <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy the Kukri?<br/>\nThe kukri is but a small weapon that does very little damage. It may be overlooked as inconsequential by a lesser combatant. But the Devastating Kukri Master knows the secrets to turning the kukri into the most deadly weapon known to man, elf, or dwarf. The kukri possesses a razor sharp edge, represented by its extended critical threat range of 18-20/x2. That places it on par with the scimitar and the rapier.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe kukri's second advantage is its size, as a small weapon it is ideal for the fighter who wishes to use two weapons simultaneously, allowing them to almost completely eliminate the hefty penalties that are associated with using two weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of the Devastating Kukri Master's training has been devoted to wielding kukris in the most effective manner possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nOffensive Training: <br/>\nThe Devastating Kukri Master's offensive philosophy may be summarized as follows: strike often and surely, hit hard and threaten sudden death, follow through each killing blow.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmbidexterity / Two Weapon Fighting / Improved Two Weapon Fighting: These feats allow the Devastating Kukri Master to use two kukris simultaneously to obtain two extra attacks each round whilst minimizing the associated penalties.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapon Focus / Superior Weapon Focus / Epic Weapon Focus / Epic Prowess: A large number of attacks per round are all well and good, but those attacks need to actually hit the enemy to have any effect. The Devastating Kukri Master is well aware of this and has included extra emphasis in his training on the ultra precise placement of his attacks. Whether it be a chink in their armour, a lose grip on their shield, or a flaw in their defensive technique, the Devastating Kukri Master will find an opening and exploit it mercilessly, rarely missing an attempted attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nWeapon Specialization / Epic Weapon Focus / Great Strength: Along with rarely missing, the Devastating Kukri Master's training allows him to make each and every attack hurt much more than usual, all through clever placement of the blow and supreme knowledge of how to wield the kukri, combined with extraordinary strength.<br/>\n<br/>\nCritical Hits: The Devastating Kukri Master does the basic stuff really well, hit the enemy, do some damage. But where he shines, where he strikes fear into the heart of his opponent is in the realm of critical hits. Any enemy that is not immune to critical hits had best run as soon as the Devastating Kukri Master's abilities become apparent.<br/>\n<br/>\nImproved Critical / Ki Critical: Intense training with the Kukri allows the Devastating Kukri Master to threaten a critical hit with almost ludicrous frequency. A base critical threat range of 13-20 means that 40% of all his attacks will threaten a critical hit. If the Devastating Kukri Master can obtain a pair of Keen kukris, look out, his critical threat range increases to 10-20. That's 55% of all his attacks threatening a critical hit. The vast majority of those threats will be confirmed, as the Devastating Kukri Master has worked hard to perfect the accuracy of his attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\nIncreased Multiplier / Overwhelming Critical / Devastating Critical: We know that the Devastating Kukri Master will score zounds of critical hits each battle. That's scary to begin with. What's even scarier is the result of those critical hits. Increased Multiplier means that each critical hit will do three times the already high base damage. Overwhelming Critical means that each critical hit will do an extra 2d6 damage on top of the tripled base damage. Devastating Critical? Oh it just means that each enemy that is critically hit must make a Fortitude save--or die. Die a painful, horrible death, as their internal organs flood the battle field and their head flies a good few meters from their body. Vorpal? The Devastating Kukri Master scoffs at vorpal; it is nothing compared to his awe inspiring capabilities with a kukri.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhirlwind Attack: Given that each attack made by the Devastating Kukri Master is potentially instant death, the ability to attack every single enemy surrounding him is rather useful. Don't be surprised if the Devastating Kukri Master quietly sings \"Ring-a-ring o' roses\" to himself as his enemies \"all fall down\".<br/>\n<br/>\nPower Attack / Cleave / Great Cleave: These feats allow the Devastating Kukri Master to capitalize on every killing blow that he makes. These feats can set up a positive feedback loop, in that he gains an extra attack each time he kills an enemy, which has a good chance of killing the next enemy outright, gaining him yet another extra attack.<br/>\n<br/>\nMobility / Spring Attack: A good offense means nothing unless you are in the correct position to use it. This branch of feats allows the Devastating Kukri Master to effortlessly glide through a dense battlefield without drawing any potentially deadly Attacks of Opportunity.<br/>\n<br/>\nAppraise / Lore: The Devastating Kukri Master may live or die depending on the quality of his equipment. These skills allow him to accurately identify powerful magic kukris and other equipment, as well as barter for them more effectively.<br/>\n<br/>\nDefensive Training: <br/>\nThe Devastating Kukri Master has a blisteringly lethal offense, but it is one that requires him to be in thick of melee combat from the start to the end of the battle. Thus, his defensive training focuses on outmaneuvering, outthinking, and outlasting his opponents to withstand anything they might throw at him.<br/>\n<br/>\nDodge / Tumble / Expertise / Armour Skin: Since he carries no shield, the Devastating Kukri Master may be thought to lack a viable defensive option. This is not the case. Hard learnt acrobatic skills allow him to gracefully dodge, weave, and tumble out of the way of incoming blows, despite the heavy weight of his full plate mail armour. His keen intellect allows him to weave an effective shield out of nothing but his weapon strikes. While this does decrease his accuracy slightly as he deflects incoming blows with his own attacking strikes, it significantly increases his defenses and helps him weather any storm. Any blows that do get through his defenses will face a further obstacle of having to pierce his thickened skin, which itself forms a type of natural armour.<br/>\n<br/>\nToughness / Epic Toughness / Great Constitution: Despite his grace, expertise, and thick skin, some of his enemies' attacks will translate into solid blows. Thus, the Devastating Kukri Master has trained intensively to build up his toughness and endurance so that he may keep fighting long after a normal combatant would have died of many grievous wounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nDiscipline: Many crafty enemies might try to strike a debilitating blow, knocking the Devastating Kukri Master off his feet, disarming him, or injuring his limbs. With dedicated training, the Devastating Kukri Master has become supremely disciplined in combat, allowing him to withstand these attacks with little chance of being debilitated.<br/>\n<br/>\nSacred Defense: As a divine champion of the deity Torm, the Devastating Kukri Master has been blessed with divinely fueled fortitude, reflexes, and will power. These will help him to withstand the many unusual offensive capabilities his enemies may possess.<br/>\n<br/>\nHeal: The Devastating Kukri Master realizes that the end of one battle is merely the beginning of the countdown to the next. With training in the heal skill, the Devastating Kukri Master can expertly tend to the wounds sustained by him and his companions, so that when the next battle begins, they will all be in fighting fit form.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Some years ago I remade the\u00a0 Kukri Master (Fighter 8/ CoT 10/ WM 22) in the <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-kukri-master-reviewed-t2348809.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Build request forum</a>. <br/>\n Basically the Kukri Master is a dual wielding weaponmaster with Dev crit. Kukris are chosen for the high critical threat range and the weapon size that minimizes the dual wield penalty. A high strength and Epic weapon specialization compensates for the low base damage of the Kukri.<br/>\nTo qualify for both the WM class and the Dev crit feat is rather feat demanding, hence the 18 Fighter/CoT levels. <br/>\nCoT is primarily taken instead of Fighter for the saves bonus. Especially the Fortitude save bonus is important in a Dev crit environment. <br/>\nA build like this would normally benefit from a third class with a better skill selection, like Rogue or Bard for Tumble, UMD etc. But in the Kukri Master build CoT is given priority for the bonus to saves.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I looked at the Kukri Master I found several issues indicating that the build is not optimized:<br/>\n The pre epic class distribution gives sub optimal saves.<br/>\nTwo pre epic feats are taken in epic levels.<br/>\nThe build takes five epic feats that are available as WM bonus feats, but the Kukri Master only takes two of them with the four WM bonus feats available, wasting two epic feats on Epic toughness to gain only 40 hp.<br/>\nThe build is human with intelligence 14 and gets 215 skill points. 124 of them are spent on Appraise, Heal and Lore.<br/>\nLast, but not least - strength and AB can be better. <br/>\nStrength influences directly the Dev crit DC. <br/>\nIt might sound odd to complain about the AB of a WM build, after all AB +47 is not shabby. But this is a dual wielder, so you can subtract -2 from the AB. The character is a Dev crit\u2019er and has a critical threat range of 13-20, or 10-20 if keen weapons, so it will need a very high AB to be able to actually hit with a 10 roll and then to confirm all those critical threats.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have kept the same class split F8/ CoT10/ WM 22, but changed the levelling order, the class split at lvl 20, some of the feats taken and some of the skills. The pre epic levelling order is dictated by the fact that I want a F6/Cot8/WM6 level split at lvl 20 for optimal saves.\u00a0<br/>\nIf you read the old thread, you will see that I have made some changes, but address that now with possible tweaks.\u00a0 Max gave constructive feedback back then.<br/>\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>Fighter(8), Weapon Master(22), Champion of Torm(10), Human\nSTR: 16 (32)\nCON: 14\nINT: 14\n\n02: Fighter(2): Weapon Focus: Kukri\n04: Fighter(4): STR+1, Weapon Specialization: Kukri, (STR=17)\n06: Fighter(6): Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack\n08: Champion of Torm(1): STR+1, (STR=18)\n10: Champion of Torm(3): {Smite Evil}\n12: Champion of Torm(5): STR+1, Improved Critical: Kukri, (STR=19)\n14: Champion of Torm(7)\n16: Weapon Master(2): STR+1, (STR=20)\n18: Weapon Master(4): Great Cleave\n20: Weapon Master(6): STR+1, (STR=21)\n22: Champion of Torm(9)\n24: Fighter(7): STR+1, Great Strength II, (STR=24)\n26: Weapon Master(8)\n28: Weapon Master(10): STR+1, (STR=26)\n30: Weapon Master(12): Great Strength IV, (STR=27)\n32: Weapon Master(14): STR+1, (STR=28)\n34: Weapon Master(16): Devastating Critical: Kukri\n36: Weapon Master(18): STR+1, Great Strength V, (STR=30)\n38: Weapon Master(20)\n40: Weapon Master(22): STR+1, Epic Prowess, (STR=32)\nHitpoints: 480\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +4\nAB (max, naked): 50 (melee), 33 (ranged)\nAlignment Changes: 0\nSkillpoints: 215\n\n02: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Save(3), \n04: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Save(3), \n06: Concentration(1), Discipline(1), Save(5), \n08: Discipline(1), Spot(4), \n10: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(2), Spot(1), \n12: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(2), Spot(1), \n14: Discipline(1), Spot(2), Save(2), \n16: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(6), \n18: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(10), \n20: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(14), \n22: Discipline(1), Spot(1), Save(18), \n24: Concentration(18), Discipline(1), Save(1), \n26: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(2), \n28: Discipline(1), Spot(2), Save(2), \n30: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Spot(1), Save(1), \n32: Discipline(1), Spellcraft(1), Spot(1), Save(1), \n34: Discipline(1), Listen(3), Spot(1), \n36: Discipline(1), Listen(3), Spot(1), \n38: Discipline(1), Listen(3), Spot(1), \n40: Discipline(1), Listen(3), Spot(1),\n</details>\n\nMy build has a higher AB (+50 instead of +47)\u00a0 and a higher Dev crit DC (41 instead of 38) from the higher strength. Weapon damage is also better because of the increase in strength. BAB and AC are unchanged. <br/>\nThe saves are better, especially the fort save is dramatically better (36 compared to 30). My build is not so loaded with toughness feats, so the hit-points are lower.<br/>\nIf you let the two builds at each other in a Dev crit death-match, my build will win almost every time.<br/>\n My build will hit more often and make critical hits more often. <br/>\nMy build has a Dev crit DC of 41 and the Bioware KM has a fort save of 30. <br/>\nThe Bioware KM has a Dev crit DC of 38 vs my KM with a fort save of 36.<br/>\n<br/>\nTweaks:\u00a0<br/>\n1) If you want a more aggressive build, you can take Knockdown instead of Great Fortitude at the cost of -2 Fort saves bonus<br/>\n2) You can take Blind Fight instead of Great Fortitude at the cost of -2 fort saves.<br/>\n3) If you want a more defensive build, you can stop at Strength 26, 28 or 30 and rather increase Constitution after that to 16, 18 or 20, You will get +1, +2 or +3 to Fortitude saves and 40, 80 or120 HP. AB bonus and Dev crit DC will suffer correspondingly, as will damage.</div>",

I tend to come out in a rash if I don't have it, and it's not like the Fort save is exactly wobbly anyway. And with this level of AB and Dev Crit DC, together with the dual-wielding, I could live without KD - which, after all (one could argue), is an almost defensive feat. And while I'm on defensive stuff, I'd ignore your 3rd potential tweak.

What you're doing is preventing another character from acting as they otherwise would, not actually damaging them per se.

      "content": "<div>I'm also interested here. If Spellcraft is no longer able to be cross-classed, then we have a problem. Mick's maths work - 2 skill points per level of Fighter, plus 2 for 14 Intelligence, plus 1 for being human, then multiplied by 4 at level 1. That sums to 20 available at that level. Intimidate, Spellcraft and Tumble are all cross-classed, so cost 4 points each, and Discipline and Concentration are straight 4-pointers. And that makes 20. If it's not a patch, maybe it's where you're playing, scorp. Is it a standard NwN setting, or a modified PW?<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers</div>",

And don't forget that you can always grab a shield and go one-handed if a fight after then becomes too tough.<br/>\n<br/>\nBon chance!<br/>\n<br/>\nEDIT: and ninja'd by Mick.
