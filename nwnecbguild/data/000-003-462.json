Preferably an elf!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn arelith you can become a arcane archer with 6 levels of ranger! Also I'm thinking of using a path in arelith called sniper:  Sniper path as an alternate archer path for rangers. Snipers lose the dual wield feats but get point blank shot and rapid shot at level 1 and mobility at level 9.<br/>\n<br/>\nWould be really good if the build had a decent open lock, Use magic device and Disarm trap.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Thanks for the wake-up call, mate.  corrected\n<blockquote><div>\nAlso, isn't it redundant to have both Listen and Spot?\n</div></blockquote>\n...only if/when a stealther begins to move.  Until then, they will remain hidden even with a maxed Listen skill.  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor all intents and purposes, those 33 points in Spot are free for reallocation.   Any investment in Disable traps over 16 points (even less with INT-boosting gear) is a waste with vanilla traps.  Certainly non-epic DCs haven't been modified as severely on any mid-magic server to warrant maxing it if the points could be better used elsewhere (OP never mentioned wanting to recover them so 16 is plenty).  38 is necessary for epics or more if the trap DCs have been massaged at all.   I like a bit of \"padding\" in the Search skill but maxing it is totally unnecessary.  The DETECT check doesn't happen fast enough to just run through a field of traps without pausing and half-elf loses keen sense which makes it even harder to succeed the check.  Even with the XP penalty I would stick with elf.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny why wouldn't one max UMD?   Reliable casting via scrolls is significant, especially where arcane casting is not part of the build.<br/>\n<br/>\nIMO INT 14 is unnecessary without either KD or Expertise.  200 skillpoints  with INT 12 should be plenty on a Lvl 30-cap server. WIS seems the most obvious place to bolster, or perhaps STR for the slight damage boost and carrying capacity.  Lore is a convenience only... unless the server abounds with Lore checks in which case, this the wrong toon to deal with it.  It would be interesting to know how high Mighty enhancements go on the server, too.\n<blockquote><div>\nAnother question: Why are your Will saves the same as mine, even though I took Iron Will and you didn't?\n</div></blockquote>\nProbably because I had it as an alternative to Blind Fight at Lvl 1 but got deleted along the way... another bump on the sleepy road. corrected\n<blockquote><div>\nHere's another approach. This build gives up some AB, especially in melee, which should be avoided by an AA anyway, but he has better rogue skills. Choosing Half-Elf eliminates the EXP penalty.\n</div></blockquote>\nExcept you would pry that level 19 in AA from me kicking and screaming.  I want that additional AB, damage point and most importantly the DR penetration of +10.  If you are familiar with the bosses on Arelith, then perhaps AA can be weakened by that much without consequence.  I wouldn't know.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI agree about the melee presence totally.  My archers NEVER need PBS or a weapon switch but my play style involves much more recon, trap setting, etc.  In those situations where players find it necessary to melee, the option has been provided.  Obviously, the melee attack pales miserably compared to archery.  Another option might be to focus secondary in sling and drop finesse altogether.  At least that way the PBS would be more useful with the shield AC intact. <br/>\n<br/>\nAccording to the OP, ranger Dual-wield is lost if they go the sniper route.  Otherwise (non sniper route), the build will need to provide PBS &amp; Rapid Shot.  By eliminating the melee option, enough feat slots should be available to slip them in painlessly.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
