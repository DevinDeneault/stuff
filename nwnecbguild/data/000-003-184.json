So, I need a build.<br/>\n<br/>\n Looking for a PvM build; I don't really enjoy PvP that much. Looking at an Elf Weapon Master with a two-bladed sword. I do like to solo a lot, so looking for a hearty build. If this isn't enough for you to go on, let me know.<br/>\n<br/>\n Thanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>First off, welcome aboard!\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n What you are considering is fine but understand that the racial bias (+DEX/-CON) favors a finessing build and no large weapons can be finessed hence you will be stuck with a strength-based one to pull it off.<br/>\n<br/>\n The RP server you are showing interest is run by a great designer, kalbaern.\u00a0 I've never played there but made a quick perusal to see if I might spot any customizations that may affect build design and yes, there are several.<br/>\n<br/>\n The first one I noticed is rather important:<br/>\n<br/>\n \"Other Restrictions: In addition to the above rules, we place a minumum levels taken requirement when multiclassing. You MUST have at least 3 levels in all of your standard classes prior to to reaching 20th level or taking a prestige class here. (whichever comes first)\"<br/>\n<br/>\n It doesn't mention if those 3 prereq levels must be in sequence like on Arelith but I haven't delved any further into it to confirm one way or the other.<br/>\n<br/>\n They also do not allow any starting ability lower than 8 which defeats one benefit of dwarves or half-orcs, though not a factor in this case.<br/>\n<br/>\n So... what we need from your end is a list of any restrictions like this that will save us from spinning our wheels trying to make suggestions that may not be possible to implement there.\u00a0 Apparently, though they have subraces, there are no current benefits or penalties associated with them so that is one element you can cross off your list.\u00a0 It would also be better for you to know what level to shoot for.\u00a0 It is possible that leveling is so slow you'd need a quick-maturing build rather than one that dumps and optimizes late.\u00a0 This doesn't ~appear~ to be a Level 40 server (i.e. a PW where the cap is relatively easy to reach and folks spend most of their adventuring at Level 40).\u00a0 There are also class and racial restrictions so you'll need to itemize any you feel will be pertinent to your goal.<br/>\n<br/>\n Please do your homework so that we can provide sound guidance for you, eh?<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>Thank you, Hip. Sorry, but I took a quick look at the forums, and didn't see any restrictions. The fact that you saw the '3 levels in all your classes before first PRC level/level 20' before I did either a credit to your Search Fu. (As well as a ding to mine. I didn't even see that until you pointed it out to me and I went looking for it...) Still, I will provide you with what I can.<br/>\n<br/>\n I went into this full well knowing that it would be a STR build. This will be a RP character, since this is an RP PW. <br/>\n<br/>\n Restrictions of the server:<br/>\n -At least 3 levels in all base classes before either level 20 or taking the first level of a prestige class, as noted.<br/>\n -Prestege classes can only be taken after level 10 (so, level 11 is the earliest I could take Weapon Master.)<br/>\n -Once the prestige class is taken, 3 levels must be taken before taking a level in another class.<br/>\n -No saving skill points between levels (unless it is to buy cross class skills the next level.) They see 'saving' skill points and powering up skills during a level with a class skill as an exploit.<br/>\n -Cannot have any Monk levels. (Elven monks are banned.)<br/>\n -Prefer not to take Barbarian; the class is restricted on the server. (Must be taken at first level, races other than 'human' or 'half-orc' must get DM permission, if any other class levels exceed Barbarian levels, you can't advance Barbarian anymore.)<br/>\n -Cannot take Paladin, as it's a 'calling' and, like Barbarian, it has to be your first class.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, that leaves Fighter, Ranger, and Rogue for base classes, because I can't see benefit from taking Wizard or Sorcerer. Ranger would be an interesting option, seeing as how they get dual-wield while wearing light armor (Ambidexterity and Two-Weapon Fighting for 'free') and that would fit in with how I see this character; a lightly armored whirlwind of death.<br/>\n<br/>\n I should probably shoot for a quick-maturing build, and a slow build-up of power through Epic levels. The tone I gathered is that Epic levels are attainable, but probably not easy. Also should shoot for a build that can be gear-independent, since I'm not sure how easy it would be to modify weapons/armor/etc. (I'm sure it CAN be done, just not sure how easy...)</div>"

      "content": "<div>Sweet!\u00a0 That will help a lot, Lanzlo.\u00a0 I realize this process may seem overly-tedious rather than just pulling some random build out of the air but, in fact, designing for a specific environment IS tedious.\u00a0 But not to worry.\u00a0 You've furnished plenty of material to sculpt.<br/>\n<br/>\n First thing that occurred to me was the favored class, wizard.\u00a0 <img class=\"img-emoji\" src=\"emoji/12.gif\"/> Well, obviously Ftr/WM/Wiz isn't feasible so you are faced with either a moderate XP penalty Ftr/WM/Rog (probably a penalty, not sure yet dealing with the class-hopping build methodology encouraged on the server), an evil alignment Ftr/WM/Asn or a semi-dexterous Ftr/WM/SD.\u00a0 BTW, has HiPS been nerfed there?\u00a0 The rogue and assassin variants are my own preference due to the power of UMD to completely alter the toon's potential with a single skill.\u00a0 That is, unless UMD has also been nerfed somehow.\u00a0 Do they use the hardcore scroll check or does any scroll reading attempt always succeed regardless of UMD level? (I recommend you get an account on the server forum in case you need to investigate aspects that may not yet have been addressed.)<br/>\n<br/>\n Rgr/WM/(any tumble class) will be quite impossible, unfortunately.\u00a0 Not enough feats by a wide margin.\u00a0 You can choose to wear whatever armor you like using fighter (or robes, if that floats your boat).\u00a0 You just don't have any innate casting ability (trying to deal with WIS will make this venture insane), FE damage, animal companion or the brand \"RANGER\" stamped onto the build.<br/>\n<br/>\n In any case, due to the anti-dump ban and the racial handicap/nontypical weaponry combo, this can NOT be a fast-maturing build, not without gimping it severely (and we don't gimp here).\u00a0 We'll discuss the why's and wherefor's once I get an example pasted together but the aforementioned class combos will most likely be your best alternatives (monk was crossed off immediately)... so choose a direction and give a day or two to work some magic.\u00a0</div>"

If you prefer, you can put those points into Lore, Craft Weapon or Craft Armor.
