Val is right, if Arelth doesn't have a way to compensate for the low Armor Class that a 2-hander would have, and if RDD is off the table, and if Terrifying Rage is disabled, and if Devcrit, as you say, is also disabled, then that's A LOT of crippling to start out with the Barbarian class and a 2-handed weapon. So, the first thing that you want to do when building a toon for a certain environment is finding out the specifics. In that sense, we already know that RDD isn't a possibility, so your next mission is to find the answers to each of the following questions:<br/>\n<br/>\n 1- Does Terrifying Rage work in Arelith?<br/>\n<br/>\n 2- Is there a way to obtain Shield-type AC to compensate for wielding a two-handed weapon?<br/>\n<br/>\n As Val has said, both answers are probably no, but we need certainty, not probability.<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, you need to start to understand the basic principles of Character Building for Neverwinter Nights. I wrote a very extensive guide for that here in the ECB. It's called \"A Complete Guide to the Basics of Character Building\" and you can find it in the Game Guides section. Basics in there refers not to basic as in beginning, but to basics as in base-principles, the foundation upon which Character Building is built. Please read it. It'll take time, but I expect you to have a good understanding of the following concepts after reading:<br/>\n<br/>\n - BAB progressions and how to build-up BAB, the Rule of 4<br/>\n - Skill Dumps, when to do them and how they work<br/>\n - Epic Feats and Requirements: how to organize and prioritize them<br/>\n<br/>\n OK, now you have a lot of work to do.

So, you don't want a Kensai, which is fine, my question is: do you HAVE TO choose one of these two paths?<br/>\n<br/>\n If so, and you'll be forced to be a Tribesman, and the summons share your Barbarian level, then a near-pure Barbarian might be a good option there, do you agree so far? So, we can establish we want 24 Barbarian levels for Terrifying Rage and for the summons to be more potent, right? Why 24? Because Barbarians gain a Bonus Feat every 4 levels after 20, so in Arelith it's 24 and 28. 28 as we know is impossible because you can't take only 2 levels of a secondary class, so 24 is pretty much our only choice. We can afford 2 other classes, with 3 levels each, or 1 other class with 6 levels. Actually, find out for me please if the summons are any good at all. If they are, then we can have them, but if not, we can just drop barbarian levels way below 24 to be able to get more juice from other classes.<br/>\n<br/>\n High level Barbarian characters gain Damage Reduction, which is cool, and even better if comboed with Epic Damage Reduction feats. That in a level 30 world means low AB, in a level 30 world without RDD, HELL NO! So we can keep CON with an average score.<br/>\n<br/>\n The cool thing about Barbs is that they have access to Taunt and to Intimidate as class skills and they gain 4 skill points per level, but the shitty thing about Half-Orcs is that they have an INT penalty, and therefore lose 30 skill points, which are desirable. So, one way to fix that in Arelith is to go 18 STR 12 INT and put the two gifts in STR and INT, making them 20 and 14 (which will also have the good side effect of allowing you access to Expertise and Improved Knockdown (both of which need 13 INT).<br/>\n<br/>\n Also, as Barbarians, we need Heavy Armor proficiency. We can get that from another class (such as Fighter or CoT) or waste a feat on it. I say we take a class that has it. Fighter seems to be the best option, as you'll also get two Bonus Feats with it. Unfortunately, you can't take Epic Weapon Specialization with only 3 levels, which is one of the desirable feats to have on a melee warrior. That's why it's important to see if the summons are worth the investment in Barbarian levels. Otherwise, we could easily stop Barbarian at 17 or even 16 and go for more Fighter.<br/>\n<br/>\n Get back to me on this and we can continue building the toon. Right now we're DEFINING THE OPTIMAL SPREAD (reference to my Complete Guide that you need to read).

I understood the gist of it thankfully ^^ it's very informative<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, I'll begin on your questions, the paths, everything, is optional from the gifts that give +2 str con etc, to those two paths.<br/>\n I agree with you so far, however, I should point out something that may or may not decide the aspect of this build, everything in the game can be enhanced, ....an example would be I could add extra STR CON etc, to a piece of equipment permanetly, even give weapons holy, negative etc damage.(I don't know how high the numbers go sadly), and I can also do the same to Spot Disc, Con, and I think a few others. Whilst I don't prefer gifts (they have some pretty harsh consequences (I.E Gift of Str and INt will have me leveling up as a level 5 would in a level 2-3 area, despite being a level 2-3.) But, that's no concern, between the RP and stuff, Leveling isn't a main concern (well it is, but, not like..I wanna grind, less I get a MOD on my character xD)<br/>\n<br/>\n Yes, I took the liberty of testing a Half orc, only getting 12 skill points, seems troublesome in some circumstances. I think, considering the aspects, a two handed barb is debatable, However, considering what I read, a Half-Orc should be able to wield a two handed weapon as one handed, giving liberty for a shield (though, I could be wrong I just read this on the NWN wikia)<br/>\n<br/>\n I do agree with you, that taking a class, would be better than wasting a feat, that's a potential element being risked for something that can easily be fixed with an alternate solution. I agree fighter levels might be the best choice (Though, I'm unable to tell, when it would be a good time to break, since you guys made Terrifying Rage to either make or break a barb.) I took a look into the summons like you wanted, from what I can tell, they scale up to the barbs level (I.E if you have 17 barb it will remain a level 17, I assume, since it doesn't let me to be sure, they keep the same armor, and weapon as you minus racial abilities, and enhancements. )) From the looks of it, you can have two of them, however, how viable they would be, I'm not really capable of testing, as there is no way outside of actually using it at higher levels to figure it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n Now you do get to use two at once, which doesn't always mean viable. Now, I'm no expert on the paths, nor do I claim to be, but reading from a comment about them, at lower levels, they are a big help, however, at higher levels they appear to be nothing more than fodder or a distraction. But, that's just from someone whom does use it at a higher state of levels, though this comment was made in 2013, so I'm unaware of any changes.</div></div>"

Keep up the good work!<br/>\n<br/>\n So, if the summons are shit later on, we don't need to invest that much in Barbarian levels. That will give us A LOT of room to play with. We can\u00a0keep\u00a0Barbarian at 17 (15 pre-epic and 2 post-epic, one to get Terrifying Rage and another one at 30 to max out Taunt, Intimidate and Discipline), Fighter or CoT (depending on the answer you give to the question below) 10 and Rogue or Bard 3<br/>\n<br/>\n Let me ask you a personal question: What do you prefer: to do more damage or to have higher saves? This will allow us to decide between CoT and Fighter. Fighter gives us Epic Weapon Specialization (and also one more feat), and CoT gives us +5 to all saves (and one less feat). Both give us same Armor and Martial proficiencies. So, what's more important to you?<br/>\n<br/>\n Our third class should be taken for Skill Dumps on the main desireable skills, such as Tumble, UMD (Use Magic Device). The classes that get these skills are: Rogue, Bard and Assassin. Assassin, however, will require you to invest Skill Points in Hide / Move Silently, which are problem, because you already have many skills that you need to put points into: Discipline, Taunt, Tumble, UMD, Intimidate, and if you have spare, Concentration and Listen or Spot (to see hidden monsters, choose one, no need to waste skill points on both). Rogue will give us 2d6 Sneak Attack damage, Evasion and the skills. Bard will give us a mild Song bonus to attack an damage and Spellcraft as a class skill (which we may not have points to invest in, so not really that good). Evasion is very important to have, and Barbarians have bonus saves versus traps, which coupled with Evasion can allow you to avoid a lot of damage from traps. I would choose Rogue. However, since Arelith is pretty RP-heavy, it may be hard to RP Rogue into the build, while Bard could symbolize some sort of war cry. Tough to say, you know better than me.<br/>\n<br/>\n So, we have pretty much defined our class split, we have defined that we'll take the gifts and screw ourselves to level him so he's strong. We need to just choose either Fighter or Champion of Torm and Rogue or Bard and then we can build him. I'll await your reply.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div>"

With my character sitting in the graveyard. All in all, it depends, on how it ends up working out, with damage, it'll need to deal it fast enough, to at least interrupt, or kill them quickly, or saves, a slower path, but... one of many, that can be useful in all universal reasons.<br/>\n<br/>\n However, I did just do some research to help fuel the process a little. It seems with enhancements you can add\u00a0 +1 possibly higher, with more advanced players to universal saves, and more. Assassin requires permission last I remember, so Rogue, or Bard, ...safety or damage output. I think the saves would be far more important, well help me out here, what's the expected damage, or saves like a rough estimate, how much can you think of on the top of your head? Based on information, I could probably increase saves from Enhancing, but, given all this what do you think? I think damage is good, but personally, on a long term plan, the saves will be more viable. In a greater sense, we need to think, since we both are limited on information, given a choice would you pick damage over saves? Give me a moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n After doing more research, a bit more, I think the saves (provided decent damage) is still there, I think saves would be best. I apologize on typing like this, I keep forgetting this is a forum, and I feel like I'm sending real time at times xD</div></div>"

      "content": "<div>Max, your best bet is to keep Barbarian to 16 Levels (when they get the extra rage) and have 4 Levels of Bard OR Rogue so that you don't have to take all three of them in epics. That leaves room for all 10 Levels of COT and it's superb saves. One could argue also that a Human would be better suited to the task if you plan to make use of the Divine Wrath, that could give another nice Combat Boost to his considerable fighting abilities.<br/>\n<br/>\n A Human \"Barbarian 16/ Bard 4/ COT 10\", with starting abilities of\u00a0 \"Str 19, Dex 8 Con 14 Int 13 Wis 8 Cha 16\" with Gift's of Strength &amp; Charisma, should do it. Of course that is only one option, Jaquerez is the one that should decide what he wants for his character and build him according to that, i am only thinking aloud here. One last thing, COT doesn't get Heavy Armour for free, so that should be taken as a general feat somewhere early in the build.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Hey brother!<br/>\n<br/>\n Now, what you are saying has some logic to it, but it's not exactly how it works. Sometimes, your saves will be SO LOW (like this Barbarian's Will save), that even with the saves from CoT, you'll fail saves, depending on the DC. For these types of situation, Clarity Potions will save the day. All melee toons suffer from low saves, well, not all, but most. +5 to all saves may not be enough to avoid getting feared.

Whilst I haven't seen any rock flinging giants just yet. I'm sure they are out their despite the constant undead, cultists spamming FOD at times. However, a recent experience last night ....with someones trap, that obliterated me. I'd say the rogue is the overall best choice, for evasion. Now, let's go onto Will or Discipline, cleave. Now, I would jump at the chance, at getting more will save, but truth be told if all the buffs from scrolls, potions,enhancements, and other players. Doesn't help you survive with the current will save (using my current knowledge) an extra 6 points won't mean a thing. (Since most people powerhouse their spells, mainly the kill one shot, or stuns up to like\u00a0 50+DC.) Discipline and Cleave are much more valuable. If not for the extra resistance, and cleave. Then, the fact people are spam making kensai monks, that wield kamas, that knock you down (I think around 30-35 disc barely saves you, deal like 40-50 damage per hit, and can easily hit you 8 times per round.) Yes, however, that's not to say that in other methods they could become useful, it's just not viable right now, or even worth giving up Evasion, or the extra discipline (a lot more things are going to knock you on your butt, than kill you with one shotting master pieces, unless its a trap.)<br/>\n<br/>\n Yes, we can talk about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n Link seems broken since ign removed all their stuff</div></div>"

      "content": "<div>OK, Jaquerez, to finish off this build, we're going to look at what we did, the hows and the whys and try to learn as much as we can from our choices (it's not the choices themselves that are important, but the thought process behind them).<br/>\n<br/>\n So, the first thing we began with was a Half-orc Barbarian. Obviously, we weren't going to go Barbarian straight up to 30, but we needed to figure out exactly how many Barbarian levels we needed for our Build to achieve what we wanted. When going STR-based, one of the very desireable things we could take is Devcrit. That was banned, so off the table. RDD is also not there for us to give us AC and STR increases. Weapon Master would also be nice for critical hit enhancements, but requirements are too heavy, so we narrowed it down to Champion of Torm, which\u00a0would give us extra feats,\u00a0and Fighter, but Fighter would give us more damage, while CoT would give us Saves.<br/>\n<br/>\n We also established that we didn't want to build for the summons, but for a Barbarian, we pretty much ALWAYS have to consider Terrifying Rage, which requires Greater Rage, which is attained at Barbarian level 15 (NWN Wiki is very useful to figure out requirements). We also found out that the summons are useful early on, but start becoming obsolete later on, so we decided to take the first 15 levels of Barbarian to make the most use of them and make our levelling easier.\u00a0We couldn't go for EDR without jeopardizing out AB too much on a level 30 CAP server, so our CON didn't need to be raised much, and we didn't need to take many Barbarian levels for damage reduction points. That practically defined that we wouldn't need to go much over Barbarian 15. We chose 17 for 2 post-epic Taunt and Intimidate dumps, one at level 30 to max the skills out and one at level 24 to take Terrifying Rage at the earliest possible level (Terrifying Rage requires 25 Intimidate, which is only attainable at level 22. The earliest possible general feat level after 22 is 24, that's why we took Barbarian there). See, every choice has a reason behind it. Learning to prioritize is a vital skill to be a good builder.<br/>\n<br/>\n Then we decided CoT would be our secondary class, granting us feats and save bonuses, and we also decided we'd need to save some CoT levels for epics to be able to take Epic Weapon Focus, Armor Skin and Epic Prowess with them, so we took 5 CoT levels before 20 (2 feats) and saved 5 (3 feats, one for each of the previously mentioned feats) for epics. We wanted to max out Tumble, so we took Rogue as a tertiary class\u00a0at 25, 26 and 27 to respect the Rule of Arelith, and only 15 UMD cuz the place is low magic. The reason for taking Rogue at those levels is simple. We wanted MAX Tumble, and skill total maximum for a class skill is always Level +3, so in case we needed 27 levels to have 30 Ranks in Tumble.<br/>\n<br/>\n Then we evaluated Valerfor's suggestions, which I thought were really valid, but in the end you decided not to heed them, using your server knowledge. However, we also learned even not taking his suggestions. He made us think about a possible way to enhance our will save after you expressed that concern. We thought about it, and in thinking, we learned.<br/>\n<br/>\n We only needed 2 Rogue levels for Evasion, but that 3rd level was required by Arelith rules, and it also gave us +1d6 Sneak Attack damage (not that damage will be a problem for us). Our barbarian can scare the living crap out of everyone with his Terrifying Rage, he can summon some barbs to kick some ass with him while enemies are scared and he has really nice AB and a pretty good 1-handed damage. He will stay upright for sure in all fights with his Epic Skill Focus in Discipline, but he'll need to rely on immunities to avoid certain mental effects.<br/>\n<br/>\n All in all, we've arrived at this final version, which is pretty cool, optimized and well thought out. All the levels that we ended on give us something: Barbarian 17 gives us +1 Damage Reduction (not much, but it's something!), CoT 10 gives us a Bonus Feat and Rogue 3 gave us +1d6 Sneak Attack damage.\u00a0We did good!<br/>\n<br/>\n OH, one more thing! About the remaining skill points, no you won't save them for never LOL. Just allocate them as you see fit. The only thing that I need to warn tou about is that you need to do so after level 27, because you only have 1 single skill point left after you take all the stuff from the Rogue levels. Then it builds up again. So, spend them in anything you see fit, just after 27th level.<br/>\n<br/>\n Take it EZ!</div>"
