      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">If you have some questions about the build,<br/>\n<br/>\n a) Rogue in this build was taken for the Uncanny Dodge and UMD buffs, Uncanny Dodge it might not seem like a big deal at first with only 14 Dexterity but when you buff it to 26 maxed, that's 8 AC that doesnt go anywhere no-matter-what. Furthermore, 20 UMD means you can buff from any Wands that you want, your weapon will be happy about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n b) Fighter Levels were kept in a minimum in order to achieve Dev. Critical &amp; be able to take 6 Great Strengths along with EWS.<br/>\n<br/>\n c) Monk constitutes the backbone of the build and it offers lightning fast speed to get on the most dangerous foe and quickly knockdown and Dev-Crit\u00a0him/her. The 35 SR means that no standard spell-like ability from monsters will ever reach you (they all have 15 CL by default) but most important is the mind-effects immunity that you get. It makes you immune to more things than you can count them, it really is that good!<br/>\n<br/>\n d) AC w/ Items +5 is: 29 (Base) +4 (Haste) +12 (Ability Enhancements) +20 (Items) = 65 AC, not many strength-based characters can say they have this much armour class without a shield.<br/>\n<br/>\n e) Brutal damage, even without Dev-Crit, this build does an incredible &amp; constant amount of damage, very quickly. Heavy flail is the ideal 2-handed weapon for the job.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
