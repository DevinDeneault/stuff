      "content": "<div>Hi all, hope this is in the right place.<br/>\n<br/>\nI took 1 of the best builds at ECB, from Kane, his Monk/Cleric/Druid and other top builds from expert builders here, and tried to play them in some PW's like Blackstone Keep, Arkhalia, and one of the popular Nordock(Forget the name), PW's.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd in each of them I was told that these expert builds Suck(I don't think they suck, disagree with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThey said that these top, best of the best builds from, in ECB here, Suck at epic, end game bosses, in, vs raids, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be fair, these PW's do have +10 to +13 EXTREMELY HIGH MAGIC PW's.<br/>\n<br/>\nArkhalia recommends a 69+ AB. And the Nordock recommends the same.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust as a example I built a COT 8/WM 7/Cleric 25 with 7,8 Apr, and about a 75+ AB, hit a max 95+ AC, do lots of damage, has a 10 to 20 x 3 Rapier. Has WF, EWF, Epic Prowess, a 30/APR 5 AB NAKED, with Divine Power, 16/4 pre epic without Divine Power, War Domain AB power, Divine Might, Divine Wrath, Smite, has lots of near indispellable buffs(except by Mords, magic dead zones, DISPEL zones)<br/>\n<br/>\nHas Dragon Knight Epic Dragon Spell, has Damage reduction 23+ and damage resistance 40+ and 50%+ chance to not be hit(improved inv), and super high AC.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the PW's I named I get told by Yunim, Kalistez, others that the expert builds here suck on those PW's.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here and on WOG they are awesome and do awesome, and WOG is a lot harder then Arkhalia, BSK, Nordock.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo why, how is it that the top, best builds here and 75+ AB and hitting 95 AC, etc, so good here, and on WOG, and can be SUPPOSEDLY SO EXTREMELY SUCKY on BSK, Arkhalia, Nordock, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis doesn't make sense to me, and is confusing.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnybody want to take a stab at responding, answering this(Not Kalistez and Yunim, as I have heard enough of those ECB builds Suck here, nonsense.</div>"

That does help a little.<br/>\n<br/>\nI get that AB's, etc, have to be higher then the best builds here.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the best builds are about 65 to 70 to 75 to 80+ AB.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd so I have tried min maxing, game mechanically squeezing every last drop of AB, that can get in order to get to 75 to 77 to 79+ AB, etc, in order to make a semi ok toon that will be semi ok at least, and I get told that's not enough.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd every time I try to squeeze even more AB out, I get told that that won't work because of +20 AB cap, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell if I can't go higher because of AB cap, how are they gonna squeeze even more AB out, when they also are limited by AB cap.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean there is only so much you can do like make sure you go 20/5 AB/APR pre epic, and taking WF,EWF, Epic Prowess, and str bonus or Dex bon for dexers, and magic weapons, and Divine might, and other special ability powers, feats.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince adding all that stuff, and the +20 cap limit, how the heck suppose to go +85 to 90 to 100+ AB.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I really think that a 75 to 80 AB in the right parties, groups, with the right players will be at least semi ok vs 70% of stuff at the end game level.<br/>\n<br/>\nIs 75 to 80 AB perfect, no, but I don't think it sucks either.<br/>\n<br/>\nCertainly +85 to 95 to 105 AB+ is probably min maxed optimized, ideal, etc, but I think suboptimal can work.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just don't see how they can squeeze 100+ AB out.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if it is possible, then since they are constantly saying that most to almost all build suck, etc, that it seems like only about 1,2,3,4+ specific builds or type of builds will work, and that 99% of the builds won't work, and that everybody would have to play the same build to even stand a chance end game<br/>\n<br/>\nThat may or may not be true, and I think a 80 AB suboptimal build can be ok if played right, built right, in the right party, with the right players.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if that's wrong, and they are right, then what's the fun of everybody playing the exact same loophole characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nMight as well play in a place like WOG, except that because I can't seem to transfer downloaded files in, on my Mobile Android tablet, that I can't play WOG, anymore like I used to, because it's files have been updated, changed, and now I'm missing the new, updated WOG haks, and tho can download them, my tablet won't let me transfer the files to the right spots.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank goodness I installed Sands of Fate, Aielund, before my tablet started having problems transferring needed files, or I wouldn't be able to play them either.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully WOG will solve that problem by Doing NWSYNC.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince having problems playing WOG, have any suggestions of what I could play?</div>"

Others at BSK made it seem like they were saying that AB, etc, not high enough, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou said that the Cot/WM/Cleric, if it were rebuilt for Divine Might, would, might make it ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nThing is tho, it had Divine Might, as Divine Might was, is why it could hit about a 73 to 75+ AB, and damage.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso there is not much difference between a Bard 1/Cleric 19/Druid 19, and a Monk 1/Cleric 19/Druid 20, as both can have a HIGH WISDOM, and have a extreme lot of spell spell slots for healing spells, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI get that the Bard level helps with the arcane banner thing, and is better, but a Monk 1/Cleric 19/Druid 20, is almost as good as a Bard 1/Cleric 19/Druid 20, really not a such a sucky difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile the builds you mentioned are better, best, the COT/WM/Cleric with the Divine might you mentioned are not suckiest, worst builds ever(others at BSK words, not yours), and would be semi ok in the right parties, with right players, if built right, played right.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Bard/WM/RDD with it's 73 to 75 to 77 AB, altho not as good as the builds you mentioned, for the reasons you named, is also, not the suckiest, worst ever(again not yours, but others words), would be ok in the right party, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Monk/Cleric/Druid and COT/Cleric/Druid, I will am willing to change to the Bard 1/Cleric 19/Druid 20, because it's close enough, as I really just wanted to play a cleric/Druid.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut even your Bard 1/Cleric 19/Druid 20 SUPER HEALER, can be via Divine Power, and Tensor's Transformation, can choose to either Fight ok or Heal. Your right that it's hard to do both, be both roles at same time, and that have to choose which role. It's just this build gives you the flexibility, choice as to which of the 2 roles, that gona be for any given raid, boss etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll have to learn more about the arcane banner, etc, but that's ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing for you, others to remember, that while these builds you named are better, best, the builds I was doing was semi ok in the right party, with right people, and if built, played right.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne doesn't have to make, play the same effective 1% of toons, to semi survive, semi be ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf everybody has to make a God Toon character, and play the same toons as everybody else, in order to survive, etc, that can take away the fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso it's not helpful to constantly tell me, others that our toons are the worst ever, suckiest ever, won't ever survive, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe post you posted above that I am now responding to was, is much more CONSTRUCTIVE, HELPFUL.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's the example that needs to be followed, not unconstructively telling me and others that COT/WM/Cleric, and other toons, are worst suckiest ever, won't ever survive, and make me, others feel like have to make a toon that will hit 1000 AB, and 10k AC, and do 100k damage, an or play the exact same toons as everybody else, etc, as that's NOT fun going thru that.<br/>\n<br/>\nThank you for your constructive post.</div>"

Between this and your other post, I can see your point, based on your logic,numbers, breakdown, why the battlecleric, is worse then bad, ok, mediocre.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a toon with the options, flexibility to either Fight, heal, etc, would be fun, but that doesn't seem like a possibility on BSK.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe, probably on a low to mid to semi somewhat semi high magic PW, but not on BSK.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only option for the FLEX toon would maybe be a Fighter 10/WM 7/Druid 23 with Dragon Knight, Dual wield, etc. Or a Bard 2/RDD 10/Druid 28, with Arcane banner, UMD, 14 to 20 x 2 Scimitar, Dev Crit, Dragon form that can either Heal, or buff up, summon dragon Knight, transform into dragon and fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as you said, that's probably mediocre at best, and while could do that, not as good as a dedicated Healer, DPS.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that if in party with a Healer, and a DPS, that could then either help fight or heal, and be a back up, substitute for if when DPS, Healer go down.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess that such a build wouldn't be terrible, and wouldn't be a drain, liability, but wouldn't be a great top help either.<br/>\n<br/>\nStill even if mediocre at best, a Fighter/WM 7/Druid, an or Bard/Druid/RDD could be fun, flexible, flavorful toons to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo because of that I think my best 3 options are:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. The Battledruid, healer, shifter(Bard/Druid/RDD<br/>\n<br/>\n2. The Bard 1,2/cleric 18,19/Druid 19,20 HEALER<br/>\n<br/>\n3. A fighter 6/COT 10/WM 24, or a  Pal 3,7,12/COT 10+/WM 14/18/22 or a Ranger 10/14/23/COT 10/WM 7/14/16/18/20/22<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for your help, time, constructiveness, logic, numbers, breakdown, etc.</div>"

Nowhere do any of the builders tout the builds as being expert.\u00a0 On the contrary, many are experimental, role-playing, or done by folks just starting out. Some try to be the best at one thing, or are a novelty, or sometimes just totally unique.\u00a0 It's not always about the highest AB (and if it were what a boring universe we seem to occupy).<br/>\n2. Every build should have in it's initial heading which enviroment it is suited for: Player vs Environment (or Player vs Machine), Player vs Player, and then Low Magic, Mid-Magic, or High.\u00a0 All of this should be right up front in each build, or at least it used to be.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n3.\u00a0 I'll be the first to say most of my builds would suck in a high-magic world (with a few exceptions).\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I think you kind of arrived at the how, but maybe not sure as to the why.\u00a0 Anyway, preaching to the choir....</div>"
