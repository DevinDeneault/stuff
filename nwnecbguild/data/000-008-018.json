His days are spent honing his skill in arms and improving his physical abilities. By night, he peers over ancient tomes, increasing his arcane ability. But don't let this fool you. When he steps onto the battle field, only the most foolish of warriors stands in his way. He cuts a swath through his foes with equal use of powerful spells and a deadly greatsword, his weapon of choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nWizard(22), Fighter(8), Champion of Torm(10), Human, Any Non-evil<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 16 (26)<br/>\nDEX: 12<br/>\nCON: 14<br/>\nWIS: 8<br/>\nINT: 16 (19)<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Fighter(1): Weapon Focus: Greatsword, Toughness, Blind Fight<br/>\n02: Fighter(2): Knockdown<br/>\n03: Wizard(1): Still Spell;

The Marauder has full mage casting abilities, however, because of his low wizard level and intelligence, his SR and DCs will be low.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan cast Epic Warding. As an epic spell, epic warding can't be dispelled. Hence, for 22 turns or 2000 points of damage, any enemy facing the Magical Marauder will have to deal with 50/+20 points of damage reduction.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan cast in armor. Though agile, the Marauder has seen his own blade turned by well-forged plate, and he knows he would be at a disadvantage if he did not make use of its protection.<br/>\n<br/>\nHas Devastating Critical with a greatsword. The Marauder knows that one does not have to hit an opponent many times if you do it right the first time. That is why he wields the greatsword, a long heavy blade that cuts through armor and bone with sickening ease. The long heavy blade also forces his opponents to use all their training to avoid being disarmed by the skillful warrior. Using his magic, he makes the weapon even more deadly, extending the weapon's threat range to <br/>\n15-20 (30%).<br/>\n<br/>\nHas epic weapon specialization. An extra 6 points of damage per hit is always useful. In as much as the Magical Marauder makes use of damage reduction himself, he knows it is necessary to be able to punch through an enemy's damage reduction.<br/>\n<br/>\nWizard spellcasting. The Marauder's motto is always be prepared. He can learn every spell that a mage can learn, except for enchantments. He then memorizes specific spells depending on his circumstances.<br/>\n<br/>\nFull fighter attacks per round and AB of 40 with a greatsword. He can almost fight as well as a pure fighter against any opponent he can't beat as a mage.<br/>\n<br/>\nImproved Combat Casting. The Marauder often has to use spells in the thick of battle. He has seen too many of his brethren drop their guard while casting. He will not make the same mistake.<br/>\n<br/>\nDisadvantages<br/>\nMediocre hit points. Having just shy of 400 hit points, this is a good amount for a mage but poor for a fighter. The Marauder extends his staying power in combat with endurance and damage reduction spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nLow AC. With damage reduction and concealment spells, this isn't a problem unless his opponent has Devastating Critical.<br/>\n<br/>\nMediocre saves. The Champion of Torm levels help a bit, and with spellcraft he can typically make saves against spellcasters, even with a 35 DC. Spells such as Spell Mantle and Globe of Invulnerability help even further against spell casters. However spellcasters aren't the only needs for saves; monstrous abilities and Devastating Critical also require saving throws. Here, the Marauder is vulnerable.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo Evasion or Improved Evasion. His spells provide some spell resistance, and he should make his saves, but a Spell Mantle doesn't last long in a mage battle.<br/>\n<br/>\nLow caster level. The Marauder will have trouble against opponents with a high SR. Under those conditions, he will cast Greater Sanctuary followed by Black Blade of Disaster. He is not above letting a summoned subordinate do his fighting for him.<br/>\n<br/>\nAB and Damage<br/>\nNo buffs, normal greatsword: <br/>\n40/35/30/25 18+2D6 (17-20 X2)<br/>\nDevastating Critical DC 38<br/>\n<br/>\n+12 to STR, True Strike, Flame Weapon, Keen Edge, Greater Magic Weapon, Normal Great Sword:<br/>\n66/61/56/51 32+2D6 (+1D4+10 Fire) (15-20 X2)<br/>\nDevastating Critical DC 44<br/>\n<br/>\nAC<br/>\n23 - Fullplate, No buffs<br/>\n43 - +5 Fullplate, +5 Ring of Protection, +5 Amulet of Natural Armor, Haste, Mage Armor<br/>\n<br/>\nFavorite Spells<br/>\nLevel 1: True Strike, Mage Armor, Shield<br/>\nLevel 2: Bull's Strength, Endurance, Flame Weapon, Death Armor<br/>\nLevel 3: Displacement, Keen Edge, Flame Arrow, Greater Magic Weapon, Haste, Magic Circle Against Alignment<br/>\nLevel 4: Improved Invisibility, Isaac's Lesser Missile Storm, Minor Globe of Invulnerability<br/>\nLevel 5: Elemental Shield, Lesser Mind Blank, Lesser Spell Mantle, Mestil's Acid Sheath<br/>\nLevel 6: Bigby's Forceful Hand, Isaac's Greater Missile Storm, Globe of Invulnerability, True Seeing, Greater Spell Breach, Greater Dispelling<br/>\nLevel 7: Bigby's Grasping Hand, Banishment, Delayed Blast Fireball, Shadow Shield, Spell Mantle<br/>\nLevel 8: Greater Sanctuary, Horrid Wilting, Mind Blank, Premonition<br/>\nLevel 9: Black Blade of Disaster, Mordenkainen's Disjunction, Time Stop, Greater Spell Mantle<br/>\nLevel 10: Epic Warding<br/>\n<br/>\nMagic Item Wishlist<br/>\nImmunity to critical hits item. With 50 points of damage reduction and immunity to critical hits, the Marauder knows he would turn even the sharpest blade.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrength and intelligence boosting items. The former will help his AB problems. The latter will increase the DC of his spells and grant bonus spells.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaving throw boosting item. The Marauder knows he will face wizards as well as warriors. Against the former he knows he needs defense.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvasion or Improved Evasion granting item. These items will greatly aid him in his duels with other spell casters.<br/>\nSpell Sequencing item. The Marauder knows that getting your defenses up quickly can be the difference between life and death.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
