PM is there for hp, armor, and critical hit immunity. I was rethinking the levels and realized I won't get any epic feats. You need lvl 10 pm for crit hit imm so it seems sd shouldn't be lvl 10. I just need to think where to cut it off at and whether to level in wiz or pm.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

What is that class giving you? When you answer that, we will get the number of levels we need.<br/>\nIf it's just for Hide in Plain Sight, then you need only 1 level. If it's for Hide in Plain Sight AND Uncanny Dodge AND skill dumps, you'll need at least 2 levels. If it's for Defensive Roll as well, you'll need at least 5 levels, so on and so forth. So, if you want to define how many SD levels you want, you need to think about the class features you get at each level and whether or not they're important for your build concept.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, which one is it?<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">That's not very optimal. Wizards gain a feat every 3 levels after 20, so 26 and 28 are almost the same except for 2 more caster levels (meh). I'd either go Wizard 29 / PM 10 / SD 1 and live without Tumble AC for a very long time (if you can handle it) or Wizard 26 PM 10 SD 4 and have 4 skill dumps (2 pre-and 2 epic ones or 1 pre-epic and 3 epic ones). You will be 1 level away from Defensive Roll, but it's not that bad not to have it since you are already immune to criticals. The only downside is spending your feats on Dodge and Mobility as a requirement to SD, but HiPS is always nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Then SD 1 at level 8 for HIPS asap and 3 more SD levels at lvl 17, 27 and 37(or later) for skilldumps.<br/>\nYou get a high level mage with good spell penetration and focus on intelligence for high spell DC. The mage has high stealth ranks and can HIPS.<br/>\nYou max the stealth skills and maybe even take skill focus/ epic skill focus to get a high enough modified rank. Taking tumble beyond 5 ranks is optional, but recommended if AC is important for your play style.  <br/>\nThere are several classes with class skills that will help qualify for SD. PM is one of them with hide and move silently. Tumble must be x-classed, but then again PM1 gives +2 AC. As long as you only take 1 PM level pre epic, you get the same number of spellslots level by level as would a pure wizard. <br/>\nWizards can afford to spend feats for SD and stealth since they get meta magical bonus feats.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
