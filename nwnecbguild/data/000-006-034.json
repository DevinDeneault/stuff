You\u2019re a 37<sup>th</sup> level caster with Nature\u2019s Balance! You\u2019ll demolish Toolset SR like a hot axe through butter!\u201d Indeed, if you are confining and consigning yourself to playing the OCs and offline mods, then you probably should swap them out for BF and Toughness (or Maximize and Scribe Scroll, etc).\u00a0 But if you are playing anywhere serious, know that SR goes above the default toolset values, and Monk SR cannot be lowered by Nature\u2019s Balance.\u00a0 Would\u00a0 you get more use and value out of a couple other feats.\u00a0 Sure, most likely.\u00a0 But consider it an insurance policy.\u00a0 If you want to be the most powerful, you have to beat SR in all shapes and sizes.<br/>\n\u00a0<br/>\n<strong>Similar Builds</strong><br/>\nMany of the builds that go this deep in Druid level seem to focus on Dragon, but I will single them all out.\u00a0 The following are taken from the Search Engines from the New Guild and the Old.\n<ul>\n<li>\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build227920.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Elementalist Spellcaster</a>, by GhostNWN.\u00a0 40<sup>th</sup> level druid.\u00a0 The Heirophant is stronger.</li>\n<li>\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build187089.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Iconic Druid</a> (sorta) by MartinJHolmm Druid38/Ftr1/Monk1.\u00a0 There are a number of issues in this build.</li>\n<li><strong>\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build262121.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Divine Exclamation</a></strong> by Thax\u2019, a Druid37/Assn2/Monk1.\u00a0 This build is closest to the Heiro in that it, too, is a caster build.\u00a0 Main differences \u2013 he\u2019s evil, spends 3 feats on Evocation which I tend to shy from as a player, doesn\u2019t get max Wisdom, and no Dragon Shape.</li>\n<li><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build232903.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nature\u2019s Defender</a>, by Talamier, Druid36/Monk2/SD2, a not-so-optimized HiPSing dragon.</li>\n<li><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build312843.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Silvanite Shadewood Mistress</a>, by kevinxiaowis, Druid36/Monk2/SD2, another HiPSing dragon.</li>\n<li>\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build174943.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Witch</a>, by Aligory, Druid37/Rogue1/SD2.\u00a0 Another caster druid (yay!).\u00a0 But no Monk, no dragon shape as back-up, questionable feat choices, and not as powerful as the Heirophant.</li>\n<li><a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nwnecbguild/the-skilled-and-sneaky-draconian-arch-druid-ssd-dr-t2355112.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Skilled and Sneaky Draconian Arch-Druid</strong></a> [SSD] (Druid 36/Monk 1/Rogue 3).

The only loss is 1 AB ranged/melee and 1 penetration power, so 40th level vs 41st (but I want it to go to 11!). The other caveat is that adding the Monk pre-epic does not give a +2 save bump in that scenario, it gives a +1 Fort, +2 Reflex, +1 Will bump, because Druid 20 gets their last Fort/Will increase.\u00a0 Still noteworthy, though.\u00a0 I would call that the working man's version!<br/>\n<blockquote><div><cite>Mick Dagger wrote:</cite>Skills<br/>\n(Normally I would ask for a skills schedule - but here with 37 Druid levels I think things are quite obvious.
