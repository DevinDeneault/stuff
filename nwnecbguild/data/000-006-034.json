      "content": "<div>Hail, ECBers!!<br/>\n<br/>\nWoG is down, and I cannot resist the urge to get some form on NWN flowing through my veins, so I started redoing my Cleric Zen Archer build to squeeze in Called Shot, Epic Prowess and Extend Spell. I managed to do so for the first 2 feats, but not willing to drop ANY Wisdom for spellbook management. I think that it's valid enough to mention KillerKat's suggested tweaks as an alternative. So if you want Extend and Empower Spell, drop 2 Great Wisdoms for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe title is kind of cheesy, though. Demolition Man is the nickname of former Strikeforce Heavyweight Champion Alistair Overeem, which is nice, and there is also the semantic proximity of Demolition and Implosion, so I thought it was a clever\"ish\" name, but then I read it now and I thought it to be kinda cheesy.

But since we started from scratch, I thought this one deserves a topic here.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy offensive spell selection is vital to understand how to use the build, and also why I chose to give up Extend and Empower for more Wisdom:<br/>\n<br/>\nLvl 1 - Divine Favor<br/>\nLvl 2 - There are no good ones, so I put Invisibility here for scouting / fleeing.<br/>\nLvl 3 - Searing Light (put many buffs here, as Searing Light is half-worthless). I use it much to finish off creatures I have used Harm on. You need do only 1d4 damage, and Divine damage resistance isn't common. It prevents you from wasting a better spell to finish off near dead enemies, which is good.<br/>\nLvl 4 - Hammer of the Gods (mostly for the stun effect on low-will saving types)<br/>\nLvl 5 - Flamestrike<br/>\nLvl 6 - Harm / Blade Barrier<br/>\nLvl 7 - Word of Faith<br/>\nLvl 8 - Fire Storm<br/>\nLvl 9 - IMPLOSION (It deserves capital letters )<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see, there are good offensive spells or buffs to use in abundance at each spell level. You will have a high enough WIS score to choose any number that is sufficient to last you through the day. The high caster level means you don't NEED Extend, and the availability of good offensive spells at all levels means you don't NEED empower. If I could squeeze them in without hurting my sniping or lowering my Wisdom, those two feats would be my next choice, alas you need to decide between being the best at what you do or being able to do more things. I chose the former. But as KillerKat suggested, you could go with them as well without hurting the idea. Another of his suggestions which kinda made me think for a while was dropping Martial weapons and settling for a sling. But I don't think I have EVER seen a WoG mob drop a sling or bullets consistently, so I chose to keep the bow, as there are places where you can stock up on fire arrows for free. Still, if you do decide to go with this, take Silent Spell, and you can prevent casters from casting if you cast silence on yourself and approach them. I, however, find that you are already a caster's worst nightmare, alongside high SR monks, so you needn't dwell on that much.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know that NASTY mage boss that has killed many of your toons with IGMS, Bigby's 9 and then some other crap? Approach him / her invisible and fire one single Implosion. Revenge will be yours! Or stay from afar, sniping the shit out of them, not allowing them to cast.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I need to address here is the domain selection. I chose Plant because in regular NWN, the only item slot that buffs natural AC is the amulet, which happens to be the same that buffs Wisdom. But if your server, like WoG, has plenty of non-amulet custom items that enhance Natural AC or alternatively Wisdom belts, or cloaks, or helms, then Plant is droppable. Trickery is the main one, because I use invisibility to scout a lot, and because of the 50% concealment, which is great against archers. You needn't worry about meleers, as most of the time they will not manage to get close to you. In WoG, pick any god that has trickery and allows you to be lawful. I don't know them by hard yet, so I don't know which ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the early levels, I usually summon a lot with 8 STR Clerics. I have 3 of those: this guy, my Cleric Wizard Monk and my Shadow Priest build, which I will post here soon enough. Let the summons be your meatshield and rain arrows from afar, or use all your slots in lvl 2 for invisibility and all others as Summon Creature and just watch them do the dirty work for ya. That will work in WoG. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can take Rogue at 40 is to avoid XP penalty, but then you'll lose a couple of minor things: 1 to saves vs spells (Spellcraft 45) and 1 Concentration, besides 2 levels of full Tumble AC and UMD. Either way is fine, really.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a quite cheap build, I realize, so if you don't want to risk being drunk with power, my advice is not to try it .<br/>\n<br/>\nWhaddya think? Hip, see how much it changed since that early draft I sent you? <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

I wanted Listen, UMD, Spellcraft, Concentration and Tumble. As I was building, I kept accumulating the points up until level 38 because I didn't know how many I'd have left and I was too lazy to do the math. I stand corrected, then, they can be taken from levels 1 to 8, or, if you feel the need, they can be spent in other skills as well, as Heal is not a key skill to have.

      "content": "<div>If you want a more caster version of this build, you can get rid of the bow feats for metamagic feats. That way you can be a more effective caster while not losing many AB points. I have a few comments, however. Maximize Spell is very good for arcane casters, but for Clerics it is less useful because on levels that you can maximize a certain good spell, there is generally a better spell to be memorized. I also slightly tweaked the skills because on WoG there has been a change where True Seeing now adds to Spot, so Listen was dropped in favor of Spot. I also reduced UMD by 10, but if you play on high magic, just take 10 points off of Heal and put them there.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last thing: if you feel the need to cast offensive spells one level higher, then you could swap Extend for Silent Spell (and use the combo of casting silence on yourself and getting near casters to prevent them from casting). But in my experience, the loss of Extend Spell causes Clerics more trouble than it's worth, because of the limited Divine Favor duration.<br/>\n<br/>\nWithout further delay: Demolition Man - Caster Version!<br/>\n<br/>\nCleric(38), Monk(1), Rogue(1), Human<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 8<br/>\nDEX: 14<br/>\nCON: 10<br/>\nWIS: 18 (38)<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Cleric(1): Weapon Proficiency Martial, Point Blank Shot, Domain Plant, Domain Trickery<br/>\n02: Cleric(2)<br/>\n03: Cleric(3): Spell Focus: Evocation<br/>\n04: Cleric(4): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br/>\n05: Cleric(5)<br/>\n06: Cleric(6): Zen Archery<br/>\n07: Cleric(7)<br/>\n08: Cleric(8): WIS+1, (WIS=20)<br/>\n09: Cleric(9): Extend Spell<br/>\n10: Cleric(10)<br/>\n11: Cleric(11)<br/>\n12: Cleric(12): WIS+1, Called Shot, (WIS=21)<br/>\n13: Cleric(13)<br/>\n14: Cleric(14)<br/>\n15: Cleric(15): Empower Spell<br/>\n16: Cleric(16): WIS+1, (WIS=22)<br/>\n17: Cleric(17)<br/>\n18: Cleric(18): Greater Spell Focus: Evocation<br/>\n19: Cleric(19)<br/>\n20: Cleric(20): WIS+1, (WIS=23)<br/>\n21: Cleric(21): Epic Spell: Mummy Dust<br/>\n22: Monk(1): {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}<br/>\n23: Cleric(22)<br/>\n24: Cleric(23): WIS+1, Great Wisdom I, Epic Spell Focus: Evocation, (WIS=25)<br/>\n25: Cleric(24)<br/>\n26: Cleric(25)<br/>\n27: Cleric(26): Great Wisdom II, Great Wisdom III, (WIS=27)<br/>\n28: Cleric(27): WIS+1, (WIS=28)<br/>\n29: Cleric(28)<br/>\n30: Cleric(29): Great Wisdom IV, Great Wisdom V, (WIS=30)<br/>\n31: Cleric(30)<br/>\n32: Cleric(31): WIS+1, (WIS=31)<br/>\n33: Cleric(32): Great Wisdom VI, Great Wisdom VII, (WIS=33)<br/>\n34: Cleric(33)<br/>\n35: Cleric(34)<br/>\n36: Cleric(35): WIS+1, Great Wisdom VIII, Great Wisdom IX, (WIS=36)<br/>\n37: Cleric(36)<br/>\n38: Rogue(1)<br/>\n39: Cleric(37): Epic Prowess<br/>\n40: Cleric(38): WIS+1, Great Wisdom X, (WIS=38)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 318<br/>\nSkillpoints: 223<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 22/36/18<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9<br/>\nBAB: 25<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 25 (melee), 40 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 34/34<br/>\nSpell Casting: Cleric(9)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nConcentration 43(43), Heal 23(37), Open Lock 1(3), Spellcraft 43(45), Spot 41(55), Tumble 40(42), UMD 31(30)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Concentration(4), Heal(4), Open Lock(1), Spellcraft(4), Save(6), <br/>\n02: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(8), <br/>\n03: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(10), <br/>\n04: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(12), <br/>\n05: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(14), <br/>\n06: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(16), <br/>\n07: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(18), <br/>\n08: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(20), <br/>\n09: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(22), <br/>\n10: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(24), <br/>\n11: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(26), <br/>\n12: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(28), <br/>\n13: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(30), <br/>\n14: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(32), <br/>\n15: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(34), <br/>\n16: Concentration(1), Heal(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(36), <br/>\n17: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(39), <br/>\n18: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(42), <br/>\n19: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(45), <br/>\n20: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(48), <br/>\n21: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(51), <br/>\n22: Concentration(1), Tumble(25), Save(32), <br/>\n23: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(2), Save(34), <br/>\n24: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(37), <br/>\n25: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(40), <br/>\n26: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(43), <br/>\n27: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(46), <br/>\n28: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(49), <br/>\n29: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(52), <br/>\n30: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(55), <br/>\n31: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(58), <br/>\n32: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(61), <br/>\n33: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(64), <br/>\n34: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(67), <br/>\n35: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(70), <br/>\n36: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(73), <br/>\n37: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(76), <br/>\n38: Spot(41), Tumble(15), UMD(31), <br/>\n39: Concentration(2), Heal(1), Spellcraft(2), <br/>\n40: Concentration(1), Heal(3), Spellcraft(1), <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>"

Once you have Zen archery, Wis is used to aim, and str is used to deal damage so having a 14 dex doesn't seem that useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAm I missing something?</div>"

Many times you will have to work hard at lower levels in order to achieve greatness later. At least here he does make the concession of using summons heavily at those early levels, meaning you can hide behind a rock and accumulate xp by default.

You will lose that crazy wisdom score, but it might be more than what you require for what you need. The feat progression is very tight pre-epic. I haven't had time to look through the build in detail to be 100% certain though.<br/>\nIf you did want to make the change (or changes to other builds in future) can I recommend you try using Kamiryn's CBC Excel Spreadsheet to see what builds look like with adjustments which you suggest?<br/>\nIt can be found in the NWN Vault:\u00a0<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/other/tool/characterbuildcalculator-cbc\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://neverwintervault.org/project/nw ... ulator-cbc</a><br/>\nIt will output the final ending stats etc so is a very valuable tool!

They also have some additional versatility opportunities with domain choice.<br/>\n<br/>\nA cleric, for example, can net 2x +2 Wisdom rings, +3 Wisdom helm, +2 Wisdom cloak, +2 Wisdom neck as soon as they can afford the coin for a +11 wisdom total (there also shields, belts with wisdom on it that are less useful but can cap you).  They can then mitigate negative energy effects, death effects, paralysis/entanglement effects, level drain effects all via spells.  I tend to wear the immune fear belt all the time and shift in DR belts where useful simply because fear effects are so debilitating  so that slot is not available for me on anything other than a Paladin build.<br/>\n<br/>\nDexterity, Charisma and Constitution are similarly easy to cap as soon as you have the coin.  I am not sure about Intelligence and Strength (pre-Epic)as I have not went looking for / cataloging purchase locations for those yet.  <br/>\n<br/>\nAs noted, when not on clerics, there are other things worth considering for those slots, but spellbook casters have less flexibility with spell slot loss resulting in memorised spell lose from equipment shifting than melee.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy current \u201cDemolition Man\u201d build is level 25 (early epic) and has Wisdom overcapped at +13, Strength capped with bulls strength, Dex capped with Cat\u2019s Grace and Con at half of cap.  She wears immune knockdown/dodge boots and an immune fear belt.  This is with non-purchasable gear but without farming as I really lack the knowledge on this server to farm much currently.

I have played before a couple of times,my highest character from prior visits is 3rd level.  Currently my highest level character is 25th level derivative of this build and my second highest is 13th, my third is that same 3rd level character.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am not really in a  position to metagame. Well, that is incorrect, I cannot metagame much :). WebShaman, on the other hand, is in a better position to metagame.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, as a very new player, I can state with absolute certainty that a new player can max their primary stat pre-epic in purchasable items alone and be well on the way to maxing a second stat, with the possible exceptions of Strength and Intelligence (and you can get damn close) as I have not cataloged purchase locations for those yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nI apologise if this ruffles some feathers but it is absolutely 100% correct.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI also agree that there may be other, more effective use for some of those slots for non clerics.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith respect to +4 versions as purchasable items,as stated by WebShaman, I have only found/cataloged purchasable items at that level in the Adventurers Guild and player sales (outside the GH) I look forward to finding the +4 item stores and cataloging them. Perhaps in week 4 :)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I am calm, just amused mostly.  However I believe the question originally asked has been answered correctly.  It is possible to cap Wisdom EASILY on WoG, I did it on my first character to reach above 3rd level on the server in mid teens which is late week one or early week two of my WoG experience timeline (using a derivative of this build) making me a newbie.  I also cataloged, during that same period, enough purchasable gear to do it from the merchants alone.  I am now near the end of week 3 of my time on WoG.  <br/>\n<br/>\nOther, more experienced players, have apparently done it at 2nd level :)<br/>\n<br/>\nI also want to call out that I am not intentionally involving myself in a virtual epeen conversation but this is my perception of the convo so far:<br/>\n1. OP: can you get +12 in gear<br/>\n2. Me: yes easily <br/>\n3. Others: well, not easily and there are important item trade offs <br/>\n4. Me: here is an example all pre-epic merchant purchases<br/>\n5. Webshaman: you are mostly incorrect but I agree with everything said.  However you should be buying +4 gear.<br/>\n6. Gkorjax: Stop meta gaming it is not easy for a newbie<br/>\n7. Me: I am a newbie<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI shall extract myself now, but if the OP needs further advice on how to do this and WebShaman is not available, I am happy to help, but flick me a PM, it is easy and accomplishable quickly and without any difficult metagaming but I don\u2019t want to spend all this time simply defending it as viable so PM is much simpler and less ego centric.<br/>\n<br/>\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk</div>"

That being said, if this is a player who has only completed the standard bioware campaigns and is 'fresh' to WoG, this is actually expected behaviour for an average player, pretty funny in retrospect :)<br/>\n<br/>\nZanithar might be new to the server but I would guess based on what he/she has posted that his/her character building skills are excellent, and what was achieved on the WoG server in 4 weeks, a pretty good NWN player, particularly if quite a bit of this stuff was done solo. In terms of Zanithar's overall skill levels in both character building and playing skill I would estimate he/she is sitting in the top 95th to 99th centile plus of players here, at least. So we are talking about a pretty skilled 'newbie' here, not the average NWN player. Likewise with Web and Gkorjax - I'm learning stuff from them all the time, they are supremely skilled again in the top 99th centile here</div>"

You should check it out. Even though you show a firm grasp on NwN in general, there may be a couple of things you could learn there. E.G.: How the Divine Power extra attack per round interacts with Monk attack progression, etc....<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, putting things into context, Avado used to play WAY back in the day, when things were very different. FYI, when 1.69 version was released, he had already stopped playing. It's not that what he says is not true, it's just that many things have changed since then, so I would say my guide is more \"current\" than his.<br/>\n<br/>\nI would also recommend to the players who are having a hard time playing this build (on WoG or elsewhere), to read this guide as well. This build is probably one of the EASIEST to play, if not THE EASIEST to play. Some shortcomings of this build can and should be circumvented with PLAYSTYLE tweaks. As an example, in the Goblin Cave, when you fight the Goblin Chieftain, you don't let the Skeleton charge in. You ask it to hold, snipe some creature, have it killed, rinse and repeat. When the boss comes, you summon a Xorn or something powerful with the Summon Creature spell, and snipe at him with Darkfired arrows. It's what tactics you choose. If you use summons, you should know the Voice commands to control them.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nI have more to comment, cuz apparently I missed a lot LOL. But I gotta go now. Later I'll pitch in more.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers!</div>",

Since this build has 14 DEX and 38 WIS, I think the reason for taking it is VERY CLEAR. Instead of +2 to AB from DEX, you get +14 from WIS. You gain +12 ranged AB with 1 feat.

I don't know if the people who made them are still playing this build but it doesn't hurt to try.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly, since this build is mine, I would like to comment a few things and try to clear up some of the misunderstandings regarding how it works or should work or even is intended to work as per the original builder's perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis build should NEVER EVER be played as a Full Plate Sword &amp; Shield type of character. If you want to play one of those, I could probably refer you to a few dozen other builds who would excell at that. This is an ARCHER / CASTER, so you can reliably stick summoned units or teammates in front of you and just fire a host of arrows or a few well-chosen spells from afar. This playstyle will work all the way from level 1 to high epics, where you might need to add a few tricks to your bag, because by then, summoned units will die too fast to be worth your trouble. The fact that someone is ABLE to play it this way is only a testament to the power of the Cleric class, not necessarily a feature of the build.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, please understand that, except for my Magical Master build, no build can do it all (Ok, the MM can't set traps, but that's about it! LOL.). All builds WILL have STRENGTHS and WEAKNESSES and the builders KNOW what they are. Now, if you're going to play a build that was made by someone else, you will eventually figure them out as well, provided you're giving yourself the chance to do so. To try to smoothen out (if that word even exists) your learning curve, allow me to state the following:<br/>\n<br/>\nTHERE ARE THREE BASIC WAYS TO MITIGATE THE BUILD'S WEAKNESSES (in CAPS merely for emphasis):<br/>\n<br/>\n1- Through equipment or items: That fighter guy you have with abysmal Will saves can equip a belt of Fear immunity, or take a Clarity potion to fight Dragons or Undead. That Mage you have with a laughable Fortitude save can wear a belt of Death Immunity or use a scroll of Spell Mantle to avoid those insta-death spells. You can use Wands to buff up with characters who wouldn't otherwise be able to. Just from a simple drinking Barkskin, Bless, Aid, Cat's Grace potions and using a Brooch of Shielding and a Dust of Disappearance, you can gain 2 AB, 8-9 AC and 50% concealment. That is HUGE in the early levels, and WILL make a difference in whether you succeed or die in a challenging battle. Imagine if you have a potion of Haste!<br/>\n<br/>\nKnowing what the build's weaknesses are, you can mitigate or in some cases circumvent them enirely with the appropriate items.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\n2- Through PLAYSTYLE adjustments: Similarly to the statement above, there are TOOLS that you need to have in your toolbox, there is knowledge you need to have about the game, to be able to play certain builds. These only come with Experience in the game. For example: Playing a DEX-based Assassin is VERY DIFFERENT from playing a STR-based Barbarian. Playing an Arcane caster is basically the opposite of playing an arcane Spellsword. You SHOULD be able to adjust your playstyle to the character.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nTo exemplify how knowledge of the game can improve your playstyle, I'll share something of an \"insider\" secret that I use A LOT. Knowing how attacks are added to each 2-second flurry in a round can help you use Knockdown or Disarm more effectively. If your character has 3 attacks per round, they will attack as follows: 1-1-1. Obviously in this case, the first attack is the one at the highest BAB. However, if you drink a Haste potion with said character, it will now have 4 attacks per round, so it will now do a 2-1-1 attack flurry. In this case, however, the first attack continues to be the one at the highest level, but the added Haste attack ALSO COMES AT FULL BAB. Extra attacks are added last, so suppose your AB is 20, you'll have a 20-15-10 attack schedule. When you drink the Haste potion, your attack schedule will now be: 20/15-10-20. so the first two attacks and the last attack are the highest. So, you should try to KD an enemy on the first and last attack if you're hasted, or just in the 1st if you're not.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlaystyle adjustments also require a knowledge of how the build works, when it's in the developing stages and when it's finally blossomed and can wreak havoc with its tools. For example. I have a build here called the Draconic Arcanist. That build ROCKS in high levels, but it's EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to play all the way to level 30 basically. I bet you if you pick it up and take it for a spin, you WILL DIE SO MUCH you'll never get to see it blossom. And trust me, I have leveled it from 1-23 on WoG. It F***ING HURTS. But, here's the catch. I KNOW the build sucks until it matures, so I know I'll have to rely on items more than I normally do with other builds before it can finally be self-sufficient. So, how did I play it? I BLEW ALL MY GOLD IN CONSUMABLES all the way to 20th level. It does require a lot of consumables given how easy gold comes on WoG for you to be poor at level 20, but I can say I did it. It was hard, I died many times, but I did it. Yes, it does require knowledge of the server, so if you're playing somewhere for the first time, stay away from it! This is the difference between \"learning\" a build and adjusting it. That build is SUPPOSED TO SUCK in those early levels. So, it becomes a matter of how crafty you can be to get around it. You can, of course, change the build and make it worse because you aren't crafty enough or knowledgeable about the server enough to play it, but all in all it will be a frustrating experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's a few examples of things you can incorporate into your playstyle to make it more versatile and make yourself a better NwN player:<br/>\n<br/>\n2.1- Using Darkness to HiPS (you cast Darkness on yourself, hide, then step out into the open, kill something, step back in, hide, rinse and repeat). Those tactics can be VERY USEFUL in some encounters where you have a caster that you need to neutralize surrounded by scary minions. They won't see you in Darkness, so you can hide and then reposition and take them 1 by 1)<br/>\n<br/>\n2.2- The Taunt / Expertise combo: This combo is SO USEFUL, and AFAIK I'm the only one who uses it. You guys really have no idea how good it can be. You activate Expertise and attack. then while in attack mode, you Taunt and click on the sword icon on the top left of your screen to cancel the attack action (the Taunt action icon should be right beside it). Your character starts Taunting in Expertise mode (+5 AC), and Expertise only deactivates when you FINISH the Taunt action and the result comes, then you can re-click on Expertise and attack again. Now you have +1 AB and +5 AC for the next 6 rounds in case of a full Taunt. But after you Taunt, you don't really need to re-activate Expertise if you're not being hit. You can instead turn on Power Attack to do more damage, or just do a regular attack with +6 AB if you're having trouble hitting. That combo alone will help you immensely when playing Paladins, Bards or Blackguards in those early levels.<br/>\n<br/>\n3- Making adjustments to the build itself:<br/>\n<br/>\nI chose to put this item 3rd because it should be 3rd in every situation, except when you SEE a clear improvement that can be made to a build that the original builder hadn't considered. I doubt that's the case with this one, though. You may change it for personal flavor, and do what Orion suggested, going Cleric 35 / Monk 2/ / Rogue 3. That's certainly a viable tweak, which I considered, but ultimately decided against. I HAVE played this build from 1-36 on WoG, so I know it works and does EXTREMELY WELL in almost all areas. I believe my friend BlackCobra and his mate Mr.Zork ran a party all the way to 40 on WoG with this build teamed up with GDL's Charnel Lord. They just WRECKED the entire server.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my point here is that if you're having trouble with a build, perhaps changing the build isn't the solution most of the time. You should also consider equipping it differently (and even having different items for different situations) and adjusting your playstyle before you consider making a change to the build itself. I can say that more often than not, the problem is not on the build itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>",

Imagine this:<br/>\n<br/>\n10 base<br/>\n+20 from capped WIS<br/>\n+5 from Magic Vestment<br/>\n+8 from capped DEX<br/>\n+5 from Barkskin<br/>\n+4 from Haste<br/>\n+4 from Sandals<br/>\n+4 from Bracers of Shielding<br/>\n+5 from Shield of Faith<br/>\n+2 from Armor Skin<br/>\n+8 from Tumble<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's a potential for 75 AC on WoG if you manage to cap both WIS and DEX.

I mean, I remember my Cleric builds having trouble hitting him after getting him to spend all his spells. I imagine tactics of hit-and-run-back-before-he-attacks-back would be the way this guy would do it, but it would take forever. You, my friend, have a lot of patience!

There are some very valuable insights you have given, much appreciated.</div></blockquote>\nOrion, one thing I forgot to comment on and would be too extensive to type on my Ipad, is when you say that this is \"your preferred playstyle\" as though it's a boundary you're not willing to cross. I know where you're coming from. I myself have been there and done that, but I've also moved on from that and invite you to do the same. Don't restrict yourself from being all you can be when the sky is the limit. Why would you play 100 different toons the same way? Wouldn't that be extremely boring? From my perspective, you may have an initial favorite playstyle, and that's absolutely OK, but you'll never regret adding new stuff to your bag of tricks. Believe me when I say that it's A LOT OF FUN to learn to play a build that does the opposite of your favorite playstyle as long as you dive in head first into the experience.\u00a0<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me share with you the story of how I played Nathyrra (my remake of her anyway) from 1-40 on WoG. She was an eye-opener. For the first time in my life, I was playing a dedicated stealther with Sneak Attack and trap-setting skills. It was somewhat difficult at the start, but BOY it was PRICELESS when she set a bunch of Epic traps and MELTED Lord Robilar instantly before he could even touch her. She walked around in Stealth, attacked out of the blue, cast Darkness, went in, hid, came back out, attacked and sometimes paralyzed another foe, went back in, hid again. I would never imagine I'd have so much fun playing her. She's far from an optimized build, at least to my standards, but she did SO MUCH BETTER than I was expecting and I learned SO MUCH from that experience, as I never imagined I would. And I had A BLAST doing it, because I was really open-minded about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's easy to see why you'd incorporate the Taunt/Expertise combo into your strategy, as it does suit a guy who sits in the front and tanks the enemies, but for me at least, part of the fun and the reason I love this game so much even after SO LONG is that there's always something new to learn! I have a favorite playstyle, but I also have many other playstyles that I can go to when a build is suposed to be played a certain way. If you look at my Draconic Arcanist, and try to imagine HOW HARD it is to level that guy up solo from 1-23 on WoG, being that he only has access to 5th level spells by level 20, and takes a LONG TIME to have more than 2 attacks per round, even though he's an arcane spellsword. Then you really have to start thinking outside the box. What I mean is, you have a problem. How do you solve it? With these tools at your disposal, what can you do? To me, that's fascinating.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd last but not least, I'd like to share an experience I had with THIS build, Demolition Man (who I ironically play as a female character LOL), on WoG, where I beat the Nulb pirates at level 7 solo with it. The possibilities are truly endless as long as your mind is open enough. I sent a Skelly warrior from Animate Dead buffed with Bull's Strength and Darkfire in, while I was invisible, waited for it to get surrounded, and then cast Hammer of the Gods. Dazed EVERYONE cuz her Wisdom is insanely high, and then the Skelly and my arrows finished the job. They all died without touching my character. It felt AMAZING.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, my point is, as we play the game again, and start new toons, we have the opportunity to learn new tricks, and that's a good thing! It's a GREAT thing, and it's what makes this game so special that I keep coming back to it even after all these years. The only reason I don't play more is that my computer is really shitty and doesn't run EE. And sadly, Wise has stopped working on the Old World, and hardly anybody logs on there anymore. If you're interested, we could team up and play a party from 1-40 on WoG 1.69. Let me know via PM.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>",

On WoG you can drop the TWF feats because all Kamas are crap, and even the good one isn't really that good. But what that build can do is just beyond imagination. I killed Lolth without taking 1 point of damage. I killed Orcus without taking 1 point of damage. I killed Robilar and Rary without taking 1 point of damage, and then I killed the WDK BY TAKING lots of damage LOL. It's mind-boggling.\u00a0</div>",

It was somewhat difficult at the start, but BOY it was PRICELESS when she set a bunch of Epic traps and MELTED Lord Robilar instantly before he could even touch her. She walked around in Stealth, attacked out of the blue, cast Darkness, went in, hid, came back out, attacked and sometimes paralyzed another foe, went back in, hid again. I would never imagine I'd have so much fun playing her. She's far from an optimized build, at least to my standards, but she did SO MUCH BETTER than I was expecting and I learned SO MUCH from that experience, as I never imagined I would.

You must understand how much of this build revolves around Wisdom. You gain AB with Wisdom thanks to Zen Archery, you gain AC with Wisdom thanks to Monk AC, you gain spells per day with Wisdom thanks to Cleric, higher DCs for your spells, so the last thing you want to do is drop ANY Wisdom at all. If I had to choose a feat to drop for Extend Spell, I would drop Epic Prowess. It \"just\" gives you +1 AB.\u00a0</div>",

But since we started from scratch, I thought this one deserves a topic here.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy offensive spell selection is vital to understand how to use the build, and also why I chose to give up Extend and Empower for more Wisdom:<br/>\n<br/>\nLvl 1 - Divine Favor<br/>\nLvl 2 - There are no good ones, so I put Invisibility here for scouting / fleeing.<br/>\nLvl 3 - Searing Light (put many buffs here, as Searing Light is half-worthless). I use it much to finish off creatures I have used Harm on. You need do only 1d4 damage, and Divine damage resistance isn't common. It prevents you from wasting a better spell to finish off near dead enemies, which is good.<br/>\nLvl 4 - Hammer of the Gods (mostly for the stun effect on low-will saving types)<br/>\nLvl 5 - Flamestrike<br/>\nLvl 6 - Harm / Blade Barrier<br/>\nLvl 7 - Word of Faith<br/>\nLvl 8 - Fire Storm<br/>\nLvl 9 - IMPLOSION (It deserves capital letters )<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see, there are good offensive spells or buffs to use in abundance at each spell level. You will have a high enough WIS score to choose any number that is sufficient to last you through the day. The high caster level means you don't NEED Extend, and the availability of good offensive spells at all levels means you don't NEED empower. If I could squeeze them in without hurting my sniping or lowering my Wisdom, those two feats would be my next choice, alas you need to decide between being the best at what you do or being able to do more things. I chose the former. But as KillerKat suggested, you could go with them as well without hurting the idea. Another of his suggestions which kinda made me think for a while was dropping Martial weapons and settling for a sling. But I don't think I have EVER seen a WoG mob drop a sling or bullets consistently, so I chose to keep the bow, as there are places where you can stock up on fire arrows for free. Still, if you do decide to go with this, take Silent Spell, and you can prevent casters from casting if you cast silence on yourself and approach them. I, however, find that you are already a caster's worst nightmare, alongside high SR monks, so you needn't dwell on that much.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know that NASTY mage boss that has killed many of your toons with IGMS, Bigby's 9 and then some other crap? Approach him / her invisible and fire one single Implosion. Revenge will be yours! Or stay from afar, sniping the shit out of them, not allowing them to cast.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I need to address here is the domain selection. I chose Plant because in regular NWN, the only item slot that buffs natural AC is the amulet, which happens to be the same that buffs Wisdom. But if your server, like WoG, has plenty of non-amulet custom items that enhance Natural AC or alternatively Wisdom belts, or cloaks, or helms, then Plant is droppable. Trickery is the main one, because I use invisibility to scout a lot, and because of the 50% concealment, which is great against archers. You needn't worry about meleers, as most of the time they will not manage to get close to you. In WoG, pick any god that has trickery and allows you to be lawful. I don't know them by hard yet, so I don't know which ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the early levels, I usually summon a lot with 8 STR Clerics. I have 3 of those: this guy, my Cleric Wizard Monk and my Shadow Priest build, which I will post here soon enough. Let the summons be your meatshield and rain arrows from afar, or use all your slots in lvl 2 for invisibility and all others as Summon Creature and just watch them do the dirty work for ya. That will work in WoG. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can take Rogue at 40 is to avoid XP penalty, but then you'll lose a couple of minor things: 1 to saves vs spells (Spellcraft 45) and 1 Concentration, besides 2 levels of full Tumble AC and UMD. Either way is fine, really.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a quite cheap build, I realize, so if you don't want to risk being drunk with power, my advice is not to try it .<br/>\n<br/>\nWhaddya think? Hip, see how much it changed since that early draft I sent you? <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div></blockquote>\n\nHi Max,<br/>\n<br/>\nIn WoG you can't choose the domains you suggest, but which one do you think is the best to focus, plant and animal maybe, or trickery + whatever.<br/>\nSelecting trickery u lose animal domain, but I think it's better.</div>"

Couldn't think of anything better, so without further delay, ladies (or rather, lady) and gentlemen: The Demolition Man!<br/>\n<br/>\nCleric(38), Monk(1), Rogue(1), Human<br/>\n<br/>\nAlignment: Any Lawful<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayable 1-40 PvM, untested PvP<br/>\n<br/>\nSTR: 8<br/>\nDEX: 14<br/>\nCON: 10<br/>\nWIS: 18 (38)<br/>\nINT: 14<br/>\nCHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\nHuman: (Quick to Master)<br/>\n01: Cleric(1): Weapon Proficiency Martial, Point Blank Shot, Domain Plant, Domain Trickery<br/>\n02: Cleric(2)<br/>\n03: Cleric(3): Rapid Shot<br/>\n04: Cleric(4): WIS+1, (WIS=19)<br/>\n05: Cleric(5)<br/>\n06: Cleric(6): Zen Archery<br/>\n07: Cleric(7)<br/>\n08: Cleric(8): WIS+1, (WIS=20)<br/>\n09: Cleric(9): Called Shot<br/>\n10: Cleric(10)<br/>\n11: Cleric(11)<br/>\n12: Cleric(12): WIS+1, Weapon Focus: Longbow, (WIS=21)<br/>\n13: Cleric(13)<br/>\n14: Cleric(14)<br/>\n15: Cleric(15): Spell Focus: Evocation<br/>\n16: Cleric(16): WIS+1, (WIS=22)<br/>\n17: Cleric(17)<br/>\n18: Cleric(18): Greater Spell Focus: Evocation<br/>\n19: Cleric(19)<br/>\n20: Cleric(20): WIS+1, (WIS=23)<br/>\n21: Cleric(21): Epic Weapon Focus: Longbow<br/>\n22: Monk(1): {Cleave, Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist}<br/>\n23: Cleric(22)<br/>\n24: Cleric(23): WIS+1, Epic Prowess, Epic Spell Focus: Evocation, (WIS=24)<br/>\n25: Cleric(24)<br/>\n26: Cleric(25)<br/>\n27: Cleric(26): Great Wisdom I, Great Wisdom II, (WIS=26)<br/>\n28: Cleric(27): WIS+1, (WIS=27)<br/>\n29: Cleric(28)<br/>\n30: Cleric(29): Great Wisdom III, Great Wisdom IV, (WIS=29)<br/>\n31: Cleric(30)<br/>\n32: Cleric(31): WIS+1, (WIS=30)<br/>\n33: Cleric(32): Great Wisdom V, Great Wisdom VI, (WIS=32)<br/>\n34: Cleric(33)<br/>\n35: Cleric(34)<br/>\n36: Cleric(35): WIS+1, Great Wisdom VII, Great Wisdom VIII, (WIS=35)<br/>\n37: Cleric(36)<br/>\n38: Rogue(1)<br/>\n39: Cleric(37): Great Wisdom IX, (WIS=36)<br/>\n40: Cleric(38): WIS+1, Great Wisdom X, (WIS=38)<br/>\n<br/>\nHitpoints: 318<br/>\nSkillpoints: 223<br/>\nSaving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 22/36/18<br/>\nSaving Throw bonuses: Spells: +9<br/>\nBAB: 25<br/>\nAB (max, naked): 25 (melee), 43 (ranged)<br/>\nAC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 34/34<br/>\nSpell Casting: Cleric(9)<br/>\nAlignment Changes: 0<br/>\n<br/>\nConcentration 43(43), Heal 15(29), Listen 41(55), Spellcraft 43(45), Tumble 40(42), UMD 41(40)<br/>\n<br/>\n01: Concentration(4), Spellcraft(4), Save(12), <br/>\n02: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(15), <br/>\n03: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(18), <br/>\n04: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(21), <br/>\n05: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(24), <br/>\n06: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(27), <br/>\n07: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(30), <br/>\n08: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(33), <br/>\n09: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(36), <br/>\n10: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(39), <br/>\n11: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(42), <br/>\n12: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(45), <br/>\n13: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(48), <br/>\n14: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(51), <br/>\n15: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(54), <br/>\n16: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(57), <br/>\n17: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(60), <br/>\n18: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(63), <br/>\n19: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(66), <br/>\n20: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(69), <br/>\n21: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(72), <br/>\n22: Concentration(1), Listen(25), Tumble(25), Save(28), <br/>\n23: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(2), Save(30), <br/>\n24: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(33), <br/>\n25: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(36), <br/>\n26: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(39), <br/>\n27: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(42), <br/>\n28: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(45), <br/>\n29: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(48), <br/>\n30: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(51), <br/>\n31: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(54), <br/>\n32: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(57), <br/>\n33: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(60), <br/>\n34: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(63), <br/>\n35: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(66), <br/>\n36: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(69), <br/>\n37: Concentration(1), Spellcraft(1), Save(72), <br/>\n38: Heal(11), Listen(16), Tumble(15), UMD(41), <br/>\n39: Concentration(2), Heal(1), Spellcraft(2), <br/>\n40: Concentration(1), Heal(3), Spellcraft(1), <br/>\n<br/>\nI lost the link to the stored database, but I do know that there are very similar builds. But since we started from scratch, I thought this one deserves a topic here.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy offensive spell selection is vital to understand how to use the build, and also why I chose to give up Extend and Empower for more Wisdom:<br/>\n<br/>\nLvl 1 - Divine Favor<br/>\nLvl 2 - There are no good ones, so I put Invisibility here for scouting / fleeing.<br/>\nLvl 3 - Searing Light (put many buffs here, as Searing Light is half-worthless). I use it much to finish off creatures I have used Harm on. You need do only 1d4 damage, and Divine damage resistance isn't common. It prevents you from wasting a better spell to finish off near dead enemies, which is good.<br/>\nLvl 4 - Hammer of the Gods (mostly for the stun effect on low-will saving types)<br/>\nLvl 5 - Flamestrike<br/>\nLvl 6 - Harm / Blade Barrier<br/>\nLvl 7 - Word of Faith<br/>\nLvl 8 - Fire Storm<br/>\nLvl 9 - IMPLOSION (It deserves capital letters )<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you can see, there are good offensive spells or buffs to use in abundance at each spell level. You will have a high enough WIS score to choose any number that is sufficient to last you through the day. The high caster level means you don't NEED Extend, and the availability of good offensive spells at all levels means you don't NEED empower. If I could squeeze them in without hurting my sniping or lowering my Wisdom, those two feats would be my next choice, alas you need to decide between being the best at what you do or being able to do more things. I chose the former. But as KillerKat suggested, you could go with them as well without hurting the idea. Another of his suggestions which kinda made me think for a while was dropping Martial weapons and settling for a sling. But I don't think I have EVER seen a WoG mob drop a sling or bullets consistently, so I chose to keep the bow, as there are places where you can stock up on fire arrows for free. Still, if you do decide to go with this, take Silent Spell, and you can prevent casters from casting if you cast silence on yourself and approach them. I, however, find that you are already a caster's worst nightmare, alongside high SR monks, so you needn't dwell on that much.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou know that NASTY mage boss that has killed many of your toons with IGMS, Bigby's 9 and then some other crap? Approach him / her invisible and fire one single Implosion. Revenge will be yours! Or stay from afar, sniping the shit out of them, not allowing them to cast.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing I need to address here is the domain selection. I chose Plant because in regular NWN, the only item slot that buffs natural AC is the amulet, which happens to be the same that buffs Wisdom. But if your server, like WoG, has plenty of non-amulet custom items that enhance Natural AC or alternatively Wisdom belts, or cloaks, or helms, then Plant is droppable. Trickery is the main one, because I use invisibility to scout a lot, and because of the 50% concealment, which is great against archers. You needn't worry about meleers, as most of the time they will not manage to get close to you. In WoG, pick any god that has trickery and allows you to be lawful. I don't know them by hard yet, so I don't know which ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the early levels, I usually summon a lot with 8 STR Clerics. I have 3 of those: this guy, my Cleric Wizard Monk and my Shadow Priest build, which I will post here soon enough. Let the summons be your meatshield and rain arrows from afar, or use all your slots in lvl 2 for invisibility and all others as Summon Creature and just watch them do the dirty work for ya. That will work in WoG. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can take Rogue at 40 is to avoid XP penalty, but then you'll lose a couple of minor things: 1 to saves vs spells (Spellcraft 45) and 1 Concentration, besides 2 levels of full Tumble AC and UMD. Either way is fine, really.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a quite cheap build, I realize, so if you don't want to risk being drunk with power, my advice is not to try it .<br/>\n<br/>\nWhaddya think? Hip, see how much it changed since that early draft I sent you? <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div></blockquote>\n\nHi Max,<br/>\n<br/>\nIn WoG you can't choose the domains you suggest, but which one do you think is the best to focus, plant and animal maybe, or trickery + whatever.<br/>\nSelecting trickery u lose animal domain, but I think it's better.</div></blockquote>\nI played this build on WoG to level 39, I think. I went with Ehlonna, Animal and Plant. This build here is the version I would choose if I could choose any domain, but the WoG restrictions make it impossible, so there domains must be changed.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is that you play this build as an Archer, and nothing better than improved summons to serve as tanks for you, although they won't be good forever. You can easily get to level 30 with Animal and Plant, but then you'll need to team up with someone to tank for you, while you rain destruction from a distance.</div>",

Clerics have Divine Power, Divine Favour, bless, Aid, Battletide, Prayer, etc.. The only thing Druid can do better than Clerics is buff Wisdom, but the cap of that buff is +6 to the modifier (+12 to the stat). Clerics can equip a Periapt of Wisdom and cast Owl's Wisdom, get around +4 to the modifier (+8 to the stat). Just Divine Power + Divine Favour gives a direct buff of +10 to AB. So, unfortunately, using Druid here you will not get the same results. <br/>\n<br/>\nTake it EZ!</div>",
