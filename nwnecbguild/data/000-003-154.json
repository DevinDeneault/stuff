      "content": "<div>I wanna try out the Shifter. I stumbled across one posted with 5M/6D/11SH, and I guess it looks cool. Not entirely sure why the Monk levels instead of say... umm.... no clue what if anything synergizes with Shifter though. XD I saw wnth post, I think it was a note left on the old epic builds, saying for Dragon form you need 18 in Druid? So how would (pre-20) 5M/11SH/4D then building to somehting like 18D/5M/11SH????<br/>\n<br/>\n Are there any online planners available for this game by chance, would help a lot. Love theory crafting builds and stuff.</div>"

Either dru/mnk/CoT or dru/shf/CoT requires Level 30 to qualify for DS, the earliest unless custom content changes those requirements.<br/>\n<br/>\n Monk AC, WIS AC, monk speed and feats merge with all forms.\u00a0 Monk attack progression (-3 BAB) only merges with shapes that use creature weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\n edit:\u00a0 Just to give you a taste of playing shifter in a limited campaign, here is a sample build to try out.\u00a0 After becoming more familiar with how shifting works, leave your impressions in this thread.\u00a0 I've played a Risen Lord before in the SoU/HotU combo with success so once you have established your own style, I could dig that one up for a 28-level cap build.<br/>\n<br/>\n This one, however, focuses on (but not limited to) 3 shapes: Wyrmling, Minotaur, Drider... in that order.\u00a0 For stronger minotaur (in case Level 18/shf 5 seems unreachable), use alternate feat sequence.\u00a0 Only wyrmling (and other unarmed shapes) will benefit from the monk attack progression.\u00a0 The merge is always better for armed shapes. 93 skill points are left open for allocation of your personal preference (eg. high stealth, heal or xclass skills).\u00a0 Attack: 3 APR w/weapons, 4 APR unarmed. Dru 7 @ Lvl 11 assures full druid circle quest is available.\u00a0 Ignore the native combat stats because they will be adjusted by the current shape.<br/>\nSpoiler [+]<br/>\n<br/>\n OC Shifter: Druid(7), Monk(6), Shifter(5), Lawful Neutral Human<br/>\n<br/>\n STR: 10<br/>\n DEX: 14<br/>\n CON: 14<br/>\n WIS: 16 (20)<br/>\n INT: 14<br/>\n CHA: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Dru(1): Alertness, Blind Fight<br/>\n 02: Mnk(1)<br/>\n 03: Dru(2): Toughness (effective for all shapes)<br/>\n 04: Dru(3): WIS+1 (17)<br/>\n 05: Dru(4)<br/>\n 06: Dru(5): Extend Spell<br/>\n 07: Dru(6)<br/>\n 08: Shf(1): WIS+1 (18)<br/>\n 09: Shf(2): Dodge (or <em>Expertise</em> if you plan on spamming lots of wyrmling breath attacks)<br/>\n 10: Shf(3)<br/>\n 11: Dru(7) ---&gt; Stoneskin available for unarmed shape DR penetration<br/>\n 12: Mnk(2): WIS+1 (19), ImpCrit: Unarmed (Alt: WP Martial)<br/>\n 13: Mnk(3)<br/>\n 14: Mnk(4)<br/>\n 15: Mnk(5): ImpCrit: Spear\u00a0 (Alt: WF: Battleaxe)<br/>\n 16: Shf(4): WIS+1 (20)<br/>\n 17: Mnk(6)<br/>\n 18: Shf(5): WF: Spear (Alt: ImpCrit: Battleaxe)<br/>\n<br/>\n Monk feats accrued: Cleave, Evasion, Imp Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist, Deflect Arrows, KD/IKD<br/>\n WIS 20 slot bonus: 2,1,1,1<br/>\n<br/>\n HP: 198<br/>\n Saves (F/W/R): 16/16/13 (19/19/16 v spells)<br/>\n Add'l saves:\u00a0 Mind Effects: +2, Fear: +2<br/>\n BAB: 12<br/>\n AB (max, naked): 13 (melee), 14 (ranged)<br/>\n AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 22/24<br/>\n<br/>\n Animal Empathy 1(0), Discipline 20(20), Spellcraft 13(15), Tumble 20(22), remaining -----&gt; 93<br/>\n<br/>\n 01: Animal Empathy(1), Spellcraft(4), Save(23)<br/>\n 02: Discipline(5), Tumble(5), Save(20)<br/>\n 03: Spellcraft(2), Save(25)<br/>\n 04: Spellcraft(1), Save(31)<br/>\n 05: Spellcraft(1), Save(37)<br/>\n 06: Spellcraft(1), Save(43)<br/>\n 07: Spellcraft(1), Save(49)<br/>\n 08: Save(56)<br/>\n 09: Save(63)<br/>\n 10: Save(70)<br/>\n 11: Spellcraft(3), Save(74)<br/>\n 12: Discipline(10), Tumble(10), Save(61)<br/>\n 13: Discipline(1), Tumble(1), Save(66)<br/>\n 14: Discipline(1), Tumble(1), Save(71)<br/>\n 15: Discipline(1), Tumble(1), Save(76)<br/>\n 16: Save(83)<br/>\n 17: Discipline(2), Tumble(1), Save(87)<br/>\n 18: Save(94)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n \u00a0</div>"
