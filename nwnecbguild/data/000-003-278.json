Yes with weapon finesse and her nice dexterity she can deal with lesser monsters to save her spells for the bosses. This char is playable for the most part of the game as a wizard, but her full power comes with her last level as a \u00a0monk.<br/>\n<br/>\n stats<br/>\n str: 10\u00a0<br/>\n dex: 15 (20)<br/>\n con: 14<br/>\n int: 15 (20)<br/>\n wis: 14<br/>\n cha: 8<br/>\n<br/>\n Skill Points<br/>\n Concentration 43<br/>\n Discipline 43<br/>\n Spellcraft 43<br/>\n Persuade 42<br/>\n Tumble 43<br/>\n<br/>\n Sample Feats<br/>\n Armor Skin<br/>\n Expertise<br/>\n Improved Expertise<br/>\n Improved combat casting<br/>\n Weapon Focus (Epic): Kama<br/>\n Epic spell Penetration<br/>\n Epic Spell: Hellball<br/>\n Epic Spell: Greater Ruin<br/>\n Epic Spell: Epic Warding<br/>\n Epic Spell.

She can be at the rear as a supporting caster, or near the front lines unleashing hravoc. Due to her high AC she can deal with lesser monsters and thus save her power spells for the bosses. In PvP a time stop spell comes in the first place, after that 3 maximized IMS can do a lot of damage and kill many things, add up Horrid Wilting, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\n When it comes to fight she can use Mestil Acid Sheath, Shadow Shield or the Bigbi's Hands. It is very handy to use Extended Expeditious Retreat in advance. Her level as Monk gives her a nice Evasion Feat, due to her nice dexterity and Weapon Finesse she can fight with lesser monsters as stated above. Her Epic Spell Focus in Necromancy makes her Wail of the Banshee hard to resist.<br/>\n<br/>\n This is a rather easy to play char, she is very funny and when nothing works out, she can persuade before killing everyone in sight<br/>\n<br/>\n Well, that's all folks<br/>\n<br/>\n Regards</span><br/>\n \u00a0</div>"

      "content": "<div>Welcome to the guild, rauzer<br/>\n<br/>\n You really brought me back in time with this format, but i can understand it just fine, so let's get to the build itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n Here we have an undead caster as you say that thrives by making people hit his damage shields and kill themselves due to the insane backlash damage. You are also have some nice feats over there, both thematic and potent, like ESF: Necromancy/ ES: Penetration. Probably in tough times you also make use of the Iron Golem Shape while you are encased in your colorful damage sheilds. All of these tactics are well and good but i have to question some things you have done here. Why do you raise both your Dexterity and your Intelligence instead of only the last one? Is that so you can get a couple more points of AC? You don't have Uncanny Dodge so the Dexterity-based AC you have is not secure by any means and even if it were, it is just plain better to have more Intelligence that is your main stat and the source of your power. Leave your Dexterity at 14 and use those points in order to get your Intelligence higher and then your ESF in Necromancy will be really potent.<br/>\n<br/>\n Another thing that i see, is that you take a lot of these one-shot spells like Hellbal/ Ruin, those feats unless they are taken on a PM heavy Warrior aren't worth it. In WoG these feats do insane damage in the paper (75d6 for a full caster instead of 25d6 for normal) and stiill people don't take them. Bosses are always going to make their saves unless roll an \"Ace\" so the damage is pitiful in most times. It is way better again to\u00a0 raise your main stat. Leave EMA/ ICC and EW, those are really good feats. Let's see, if you drop Hellbal/Ruin/Dragon Knight and leave Dexterity at 14 you will be able to easy raise your INT to 28-30, and now i can see a really scary mage.<br/>\n<br/>\n Well done for your first build, and again welcome to the ECB.</div>"

      "content": "<div>Thanks for posting Valerfor<br/>\n<br/>\n Regarding this build and your comments I have to say that Dexterity is there to improve AC, so with an score of 20 + Belt of agility (+10 to dex) it goes to 30, nice. Intelligence 20 + ring of inteligence + 10 does the same trick (those are items within the game's margins, none of them are cheating), so I see no point (I maybe wrong) in raising jut Intelligence alone, does it grant you more spells per day? or your spells get more difficult to resist? Please show me, for I always thought your spells are base on your caster level.<br/>\n But again, I might be wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n The gear I use for this build is as follows<br/>\n Belt of agility +10<br/>\n Ring of AC + 10<br/>\n Ring of Intelligence + 10<br/>\n Boots of the sun soul +5<br/>\n Periapt of wisdom +10<br/>\n Bracers of AC +10<br/>\n Cloak of fortification +5<br/>\n Robe of the Dark Moon (Haste is nice)<br/>\n Kama +10 (Rizolvir does wonders)<br/>\n<br/>\n These are the best items for this char, all of them come with the game and thus are totally legal.<br/>\n That being said. I will check out your suggestions, maybe Fiona can raise again as a scary mage.<br/>\n<br/>\n Regards</div>"
