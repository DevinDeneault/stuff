A 32 AB is pretty low, typically you can think of ABs as follows:<br/>\n&lt;=37 low<br/>\n38-40 average support character<br/>\n40-42 good support character, low warrior<br/>\n42-44 average warrior<br/>\n&gt;=45 good warrior.<br/>\n(different builders have different scales, but this should be fairly standard)</div></blockquote>\nAnyway, what do you guys think?<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Is your build meant for party-play or as a soloist? Is it a tank, an agent of destruction, or a backstabber? (I'm only going with non-arcane/priestly builds here, btw.) By and large, though, I'd always be looking for at least 40 AB - but sometimes I've had to sacrifice 1 or 2 AB if dual-wielding - it makes me itch to do it, though. And that's when you start thinking about APR, and it's one of the reasons I like Monk so much. You can achieve up to twice as many attacks per round than any other class (assuming d-w kama), so your chances of a hit improve - particularly with a -3 progression rather than -5: so a 41/36/31/26 AB can become 39/36/33/30/27/39/36 without blinking (my numbers might be askew, btw). Which is better? It surely depends entirely on what your build concept is. Yes, of course a combat build will want the best AB it can get, but at what cost?<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm running the risk of getting myself tied in knots with this one just now, so I'll leave it for now.

That gives room for some charisma.<br/>\nStealth characters that hit flat footed creatures generally have a lower AC to beat.<br/>\nWeaponmasters should have very high AB, not only to hit ther target. They have an extended critical threat trange and want to hit with rolls within that range, I mean what use is a range from 12 to 20 if you only are able to hit on 18 or better. They also want a high AB to be able to confirm their critical threats so they actually land critical hits.<br/>\netc.etc...<br/>\n<br/>\nIf your fighter has AB +44, it means that the 4 attacks have AB +44/+39/+34/+29.\u00a0 A rogue character with AB +39 typically has 3 attacks with AB +39/+34/+29. Note that only the best attack from the fighter is better. Most module builders let 3/4 BAB builds hit some too.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the end of the day the whole discussion boils down to how the module builder designs the creatures you have to fight. A balanced module let the fighter types hit on a regular basis, even against bosses. Against mobs you may perhaps hit even with your 4th attack, at least with a half- decent roll. The module builder must also take into account what equipment will be available, so it maintains the balance.<br/>\nHow this balance is maintained and what level of magical items are available defines the setting you want to build for.\u00a0<br/>\nWhen you play a module or on a PW you will soon get a feel for how things are balanced out; if a very high AB is necessary, or if AC is more important, how important saves are and what you can achieve with available equipment.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut given all this (and more) Mithdradates is right!<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"commentText\">I will be happy to explain Stag:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe 3rd edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons brought with it a measure of opponents worth beyond what the basic assumption before was.\u00a0 <br/>\nIn Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons (1st/2nd edition) the only measure a DM had for assembling encounters for the party was the Hit Dice of each monster &amp; (somewhat) it's exp worth.\u00a0 <br/>\nThat quickly changed in when 3rd edition came along, however. Now, the system had a measurement so to say, not based solely on Hit Dice but of all abilities a monster could have &amp; assigned a CR on each one of them. <br/>\nFor example, a fire giant (CR 10 in PnP) represents an encounter of average difficulty for a party of four heroes of 10th-level each. The party should be able to win against it with minimal difficulties if they play right &amp; luck is not against them. <br/>\nThe system recognizes that not all encounters should be equal (it would be boring &amp; wouldn't serve well for story-telling purposes) and it has a scale based on the difference of CR versus the party. <br/>\nThus, an easy encounter (EL, encounter level - EL is the general term used for the whole encounter &amp; not for the individual monster, two fire giants each CR 10, should be an EL encounter of 12) is between 1-3 levels <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">below </span>the party's level.<br/>\nAnd a hard encounter is between 1-3 levels <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">above </span>the party's level. A very hard encounter (typical for Boss monsters) could be anywhere between 4-5 levels <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">above </span>the party. <br/>\nFinally, an almost impossible encounter should be 6-7 levels <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">above </span>the party's level. An encounter with EL above that is not advised for any situation. <br/>\n<br/>\nStill with me? Good, let's proceed to solve the next questions which you will undoubtedly have: <br/>\n<br/>\nQ: Is the CR ratings always correct? Have they been play-tested extensively? <br/>\nA: No. There are too many variables here within the freedom that 3rd edition D&amp;D gives to the players. The system is build on the assumption that a core rules party of four with 25 point-buy (NwN 1, has 30) will be facing these foes. <br/>\nAdding more members to the party, allowing more points for ability generation, using more books with more powerful options, giving more treasure (as in high-magic worlds), all of them affect the general system &amp; make it less accurate.\u00a0 <br/>\nHaving said that, the CR system has indeed been play-tested extensively &amp; further monster manuals are based on the numbers of the first one, so a DM can count on the CR ratings being accurate in general. <br/>\nAn experienced DM is assumed to make the changes to his own monsters &amp; encounters based on his party's strength so the CR/EL system stays relevant. <br/>\n<br/>\nQ: How this affects Neverwinter Nights though? Is the CR/EL system as accurate here as the PnP one?<br/>\nNo. This is a computer game &amp; many things that are possible in PnP for both players &amp; monsters cannot be presented here.<br/>\nAbilities &amp; situations like flying, teleporting, borrowing, overbearing, 5-foot steps, reach, difficult ground, etc. can only be \"approximated\" through the game's engine. <br/>\nThus, the game is solely responsible for setting its own measurement of difficulty for each one of its monsters/foes &amp; that is why many adversaries have different CR than their PnP equivalents. <br/>\nWhen you right-click on a monster that it has purple CR in NwN, that means the encounter should be next to impossible for you. And yet, NwN is so often wrong. <br/>\nPart of this is the limitations for the monsters &amp; part of it is also the stupid A.I which is nowhere next to equivalent to a DM being present. <br/>\nOf course, this being a computer game can solve most problems by throwing more monsters at you.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

Perhaps Infinite Dungeons could fit there as well. <br/>\nAnd then report our progress &amp; see where that takes us. <br/>\nAs for the builds, they might be of minimal AB but that doesn't mean they can't be powerful/versatile in their own way. <br/>\nHere is an example (of average AB) =&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/builds/data/build218824.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://world-of-greyhawk.github.io/buil ... 18824.html</a><br/>\nOf course, feel free to make your own changes or invent you own builds, would be funny to see what everyone's came up with.<br/>\nI'm interested to hear everyone's opinions on this, or even debate what a good \"test build\" would be.<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

At the moment I'm half way through part 2, currently at character level 11. It is a nice build if you like playing rogues or enjoyed \"Fighter/Thieves\" in earlier versions of DnD. The build is general and not adapted to Swordflight except for one small thing.\n<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>\nI take one point in spellcraft very early to be able to use it in some dialogues.\n</details>\n\nAs for AB it feels a bit low in toe to toe combat. But it feels good enough when flanking and sneak attacking. <br/>\nMajor survival strategies are stealth and sneak attack with HIPS for crowd control. I often use traps against the toughest creatures; the ones with a high CR and good spot/listen skills. Magic wands are also fine, but not vital. UMD is too low for scrolls yet, I only succeed on a very lucky roll.<br/>\n<br/>\nEdit: If you haven't guessed already; I play on hardcore difficulty<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
