      "content": "<div class=\"content noskim\" data-tag=\"post_body_start\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">This is a particularly special build, basically she is a STR-based warrior with Epic Dodge in full plate armour. But we are not done here, in fact we just started as she has IKD along with EWS &amp; WM augmented criticals and all the craftiness of a rogue in her (IE &amp; 9d6 sneaks &amp; UMD). At the start you will be playing her as your usual fully armoured warrior but with superb criticals, and as you go you will lighten load off of her in order to maximize your dexterity as well, ending wearing just robes. Do not be afraid to do that, as you will have uncanny dodge to protect you, and if you raise your dexterity to maximum you will enjoy a very welcome +4 AC more in comparison with a full plate armour +5 (assuming you will get robes +5). Now add Epic dodge to the mix, add Expertise too &amp; UMD buffs such as Improved Invisibility &amp; Premoniton/ Spell mantles and i guarantee they will in vain try to hit you and they won't, no matter how much they try. And you will laugh in all evocation spells like wise with Improved Evasion and a 30 (unbaffed) reflex save. AB is as high as i could get it and HP's too, but frankly she is based more on her active defenses rather than passive ones and she can kill very fast with her sword, i assure you of that. There is an exp penalty on this character, because damn Elves like more to be Wizards for some reason even if they don't have anything special for them (in fact best wizards are Dwarves/ Gnomes), so i don't recommend that build for playing in the limited exp-environment of modules, but on the other hand, it was never intended as such.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh! Did i mentioned her great skill set? Because she has almost 300 skill points for you to play with   <br/>\n<br/>\nThere is only one other build that looks like this, the \" <strong>Whirling Dervish</strong> \" by DM_Darkling but he goes for Devastating Critical and in his attempt he sacrifices way too much (blind fight at 40 lvl/ ED at 39 lvl), and even then this build isn't particularly good for this kind of job. Still though he deserves kudos for trying that, and without the use of Rdd.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Whirling Dervish</strong> =&gt; <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhawk/builds/data/build293577.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.comcast.net/~worldofgreyhaw ... 93577.html</a>  (someone should teach me one day how to link properly without showing all this stuff)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://s1375.photobucket.com/user/valerfor/media/tumblr_mcx8j0nXaX1r2yvruo1_1280_zpse0b0e530.jpg.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"post-image\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://i1375.photobucket.com/albums/ag474/valerfor/tumblr_mcx8j0nXaX1r2yvruo1_1280_zpse0b0e530.jpg\" /></a><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong><span style=\"font-size:150%;line-height:normal\">Dodji Domotai</span></strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>(Fighter 16/ WM 7/ Rogue 17)</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n RACE: Elf<br/>\n<br/>\n ALIGNMENT: Chaotic Neutral<br/>\n<br/>\n PLAYABILITY: PvM 1-40<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>STARTING/ ENDING STATS:</strong><br/>\n STR  - 16  (<strong>26</strong>)<br/>\n DEX - 18  (<strong>25</strong>)<br/>\n CON - 10<br/>\n INT   - 14<br/>\n WIS  - 08<br/>\n CHA - 08<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Hit Points: 372</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Skill Points: 292</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n UMD: 36 (35)<br/>\n Tumble: 40 (47)<br/>\n Spellcraft: 18 (20)<br/>\n Discipline: 43 (51)<br/>\n Concentration: 42 (42)<br/>\n Disable Traps: 16 (20)<br/>\n Open Locks: 13 (20)<br/>\n Set Traps: 6 (15)<br/>\n Search: 20 (24)<br/>\n Spot: 40 (41)<br/>\n<br/>\n Saving Throws (Fort/Ref/Will): 22/ 26/ 15 \u2192 26/ 30/ 19  (Vs Spells) &amp; (Improved Evasion)<br/>\n<br/>\n Naked AC: 27/ 32  (Full Plate Armour &amp; Tower Shield) \u2013 (Dodge &amp; Mobility) &amp; (Epic Dodge)<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>AC in +5 environment (clothes &amp; shield) with expertise mode ON: 71 &amp; Epic Dodge </strong><br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n BAB: 29<br/>\n<br/>\n AB: +42/ +37/ +32/ +27  (Scimitar)<br/>\n<br/>\n DMG: 1D6 +14 / 13-20 X 3  (Scimitar) &amp; (9d6 sneak attack)<br/>\n<br/>\n Spellcasting: UMD Access to all Items/ Scrolls/ Wands in game<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>LEVELING GUIDE:</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n01) Rogue (01): Dodge<br/>\n02) Fighter (01): WF: Scimitar<br/>\n03) Fighter (02): Mobility, Blind Fight<br/>\n04) Rogue (02): <br/>\n05) Fighter (03): <br/>\n06) Fighter (04): WS: Scimitar, Expertise<br/>\n07) Rogue (03): <br/>\n08) Fighter (05): <br/>\n09) Fighter (06): Spring Attack, Whirlwind Attack<br/>\n10) WM (01): <br/>\n11) WM (02): <br/>\n12) WM (03): Knockdown<br/>\n13) WM (04): <br/>\n14) WM (05): <br/>\n15) WM (06): Improved Knockdown<br/>\n16) WM (07): <br/>\n17) Rogue (04): <br/>\n18) Fighter (07): Toughness<br/>\n19) Fighter (08): IC: Scimitar<br/>\n20) Fighter (09): <br/>\n21) Fighter (10): Great Strength I, EWF: Scimitar<br/>\n22) Rogue (05): <br/>\n23) Rogue (06): <br/>\n24) Rogue (07): Great Strength II<br/>\n25) Rogue (08): <br/>\n26) Rogue (09): <br/>\n27) Rogue (10): Great Strength III, Improved Evasion<br/>\n28) Rogue (11): <br/>\n29) Rogue (12): <br/>\n30) Rogue (13): Great Strength IV, Defensive Roll<br/>\n31) Rogue (14): <br/>\n32) Rogue (15): <br/>\n33) Rogue (16): Great Strength V, Epic Dodge<br/>\n34) Fighter (11): <br/>\n35) Fighter (12): EWS: Scimitar<br/>\n36) Fighter (13): Great Strength VI<br/>\n37) Rogue (17): <br/>\n38) Fighter (14): Armour Skin<br/>\n39) Fighter (15): Great Strength VII<br/>\n40) Fighter (16): Epic Prowess<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"

I would replace spot &amp; concentration for them. I would not touch discipline even if i had a thieve's hood or the like to avoid any possible disarms and make my leveling easier from the beginning. It's sad that almost 300 skills aren't enough for everything when you have rogue inside.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the input Mick,<i class=\"hide\" data-tag=\"post_body_end\"></i></div>"
